00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,990
Today we are going to start off with a little demo,
今天我们先来做一个小演示，

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,594
where I'm gonna take the application we worked on last

9
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,763
time, and add a model to it.
时间，并为它添加一个模型。

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,999
Cuz we have only worked on the view part of that,
因为我们只研究了其中的一部分，

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,036
building that nice cool FaceView,
建立一个很酷的FaceView，

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:40,305
now we are going to add a model to that MVC.
现在我们要向这个MVC添加一个模型。

13
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,841
Then we're going to come back to the slides and
然后我们会回到幻灯片

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,477
I'm going to do some slides on gestures.
我要做一些关于手势的幻灯片。

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,013
Obviously, you want to be able to have input to your app,
很明显，你想要能够输入你的应用程序，

16
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,915
you need to know how to do multi-touch gestures,
你需要知道如何做多点触控手势，

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,518
we'll talk all about that, and
我们会谈到这一点

18
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,220
then I will go back to our FaceView application and
然后回到FaceView应用程序

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,957
we will add some gestures, pinching, panning, tapping.
我们会添加一些手势，捏，拍，敲。

20
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,894
And finally, I will go back to the slides again and
最后，我会再次回到幻灯片

21
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,062
start talking about multiple MVCs.
开始谈论多个mvc。

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,364
How to build bigger applications that are made out
如何构建更大的应用程序

23
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,837
of combining MVCs, so that's what's on tap for today.
把mvc结合起来，这就是今天要讲的内容。

24
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:17,809
So let's jump right back into this FaceIt Demo.
让我们回到这个FaceIt Demo中。

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,346
And if you remember where we left off,
如果你们还记得我们讲到哪了，

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,048
we had this nice view, it was really cool because,
我们有一个很好的视图，它很酷，因为，

27
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,220
in Interface Builder, we could do things like open the eyes.
在接口构建器中，我们可以像打开眼睛那样做。

28
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,189
We could make it really big,
我们可以把它变得很大，

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:36,261
we could make it really small, or anywhere in between.
我们可以让它很小，或者介于两者之间。

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,297
And we could change the color, green,
我们可以改变颜色，绿色，

31
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,299
something like that, so that's cool.
像这样，很酷。

32
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,302
And this is a nice reusable thing that's got a little
这是一个很好的可重复使用的东西

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,104
public API to it.
公共API。

34
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,240
These inspectable things are all public,
这些检查表都是公开的，

35
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,110
so, we can set the mouth curvature, we can open and
所以，我们可以设定嘴的弯曲度，我们可以打开

36
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,878
close the eyes, we can change those things, like scale.
闭上眼睛，我们可以改变这些东西，比如音阶。

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,882
And so, it's nice, it's this nice reusable face.
很好，这是一张很好的可重复使用的脸。

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,086
And what we're going to do is make our MVC have a model.
我们要做的是让MVC有一个模型。

39
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,788
That model is not gonna match up exactly to what our
这个模型不符合我们的

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,324
FaceView can do, because that's the way models work.
FaceView可以这样做，因为这是模型工作的方式。

41
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,961
Models in the world are often databases or something, their
世界上的模型通常是数据库或其他东西

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,031
schema doesn't quite match what view you have around.
模式与你周围的视图不完全相符。

43
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,600
So you, the job of the controller is to interpret
所以你，控制器的工作就是解释

44
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,870
that model for the view as best it can.
这种模式是最好的。

45
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,075
And interpret input from the view also to affect the model.
并从视图中解释输入也会影响模型。

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,877
So let's go back to our controller,
我们回到控制器，

47
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,647
you can see that we have no model, we also have no outlets
你可以看到我们没有模型，也没有outlet

48
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,751
to our view here, so, let's add both of those things.
在这里，我们把这两个都加起来。

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,021
I'm gonna start by adding an outlet to our FaceView, so
首先我要在FaceView中添加一个outlet

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,758
remember how we do that, we got our storyboard on screen.
记住我们是怎么做的，我们在屏幕上得到了故事板。

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,929
I'm gonna get them both on screen at the same time and
我将同时在屏幕上同时播放它们

52
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,664
then I'm gonna control drag.
然后control拖动。

53
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,333
And I'm control dragging from my FaceView to create
我从FaceView中control拖动创建

54
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,134
an outlet to it,
一个出口,

55
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,903
in exactly the same way I would control drag to a label,
同样的，我将拖动到标签上，

56
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:52,871
or button, or anything else, so
或者按钮，或者其他任何东西

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,872
nothing special about the FaceView.
FaceView没有什么特别之处。

58
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,342
So I'm just gonna hold down control and drag in here,
按住control，拖动到这里，

59
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,778
and I'm gonna create an outlet,
我要创建一个outlet，

60
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,614
I'll call this outlet my FaceView.
我将它命名为my FaceView。

61
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,184
That's a perfectly good name for it.
这是一个很好的名字。

62
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,689
Hit connect and there we go, we get this code that you're
点击连接，我们就会得到这个代码

63
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:16,961
quite used to here, which is this IBOutlet weak var.
很习惯这里，这是IBOutlet弱var。

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,098
Now we have a connection to our view, and remember, in MVC
现在我们有了一个连接到我们的视图，记住，在MVC

65
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,101
picture, the controller can have green arrows to its view,
图像，控制器可以有绿色箭头的视图，

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,070
that's this, and it can have green arrows to its model.
就是这样，它可以有绿色的箭头。

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,273
So let's create a connection to the model.
让我们创建一个到模型的连接。

68
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,642
So what is gonna be our model of our MVC?
那么我们的MVC模型是什么呢?

69
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,978
I'm actually going to drag that in, right here,
我要把它拖进来，在这里，

70
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,647
it's called facial expression.
它被称为面部表情。

71
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,851
When you drag things in I strongly recommend
当你拖东西的时候，我强力推荐

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,587
you have this Destination, Copy items if needed,
您有这个目的地，如果需要，复制项目，

73
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,757
otherwise, when you drag in a class, or structure, or
否则，当您拖进一个类，或结构，或

74
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,225
something, you'll be pointing to it.
你会指着它。

75
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,294
So if you change it in, wherever you got it from,
所以如果你改变它，不管你从哪里得到它，

76
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,729
it will be changing it in your project,
它会在你的项目中改变它，

77
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,631
so, it's usually what we wanna do.
所以，这通常是我们想要做的。

78
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,732
Maybe that might be what you want,
也许这就是你想要的，

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,835
in certain circumstances, but usually wanna copy it in.
在某些情况下，但通常是想把它复制进去。

80
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,071
So let's take a look at this thing that I brought in,
让我们来看看我带来的东西，

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,641
it's a struct and it's gonna be the model of our FaceView.
它是一个struct，它将是FaceView的模型。

82
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,044
And it's a really simple FacialExpression,
这是一个非常简单的面部表情，

83
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,380
that's what this represents, this struct.
这就是这个结构。

84
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,015
And it has positions of the eyes,
它有眼睛的位置，

85
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,052
open eyes, closed eyes, squinting eyes, unfortunately,
睁开眼睛，闭着眼睛，眯着眼睛，不幸的是，

86
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,955
we can't represent that in our view but it's in the model,
我们不能在视图中表示它但它在模型中，

87
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,123
we'll have to figure out the best we can do.
我们得想出最好的办法。

88
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,360
It's also got a mouth, and the mouth can frown or smirk, or
它也有张嘴，嘴巴可以皱眉或傻笑，或者

89
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,628
it can grin, or smile,
它可以微笑，也可以微笑，

90
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,732
notice there's nothing in this model about mouth curvature.
注意，这个模型中没有任何关于嘴曲率的东西。

91
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,233
It doesn't know anything about mouth curvature,
它不知道任何关于嘴曲率的东西，

92
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,301
it just knows about grins and
它只知道grins和

93
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,971
frowns, things like that, that's what the model is.
皱眉，诸如此类，这就是模型。

94
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,209
It's also kinda cool, it knows how to give you a happier
它也很酷，它知道如何让你更快乐

95
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,211
version of itself, or a sadder version of itself.
版本的本身，或者是它自己的悲伤版本。

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,813
That's what these bars do,
这就是这些条的作用，

97
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,616
they just wanna return a happier or sadder.
他们只是想让自己更快乐更难过。

98
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,620
But primarily, this struct is just an expression to keep
但首先，这个结构只是一个表达

99
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,291
track of the state of the eyes and the mouth.
观察眼睛和嘴巴的状态。

100
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,027
So I'm going to, in my controller,
在控制器中，

101
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,329
create a green arrow to it, or a var for it.
创建一个绿色的箭头，或者一个var。

102
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,365
We're gonna call it Expression,
我们叫它表达式，

103
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,266
cuz it's a facial expression.
因为这是一个面部表情。

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,570
And it's type FacialExpression,
FacialExpression类型,

105
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,441
and actually,
实际上,

106
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,577
let's have a starting facial expression have eyes,
让我们来做一个面部表情，

107
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:18,516
which are, let's say, open, and a mouth, which is a grin.
也就是说，打开一个嘴巴，一个咧嘴笑。

108
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,419
That sound like a happy place to start.
这听起来像是一个很好的开始。

109
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:22,954
So that's great,
这是伟大的,

110
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:27,725
now, remember that the primary job of a controller
现在，请记住，控制器的主要工作

111
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,062
is to interpret the model for the view and vice versa.
是为视图解释模型，反之亦然。

112
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,165
So I'm gonna add a private function here-
我要在这里添加一个私有函数

113
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,367
you'll all often have a method or
你会经常有一个方法

114
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,769
a number of methods in your controller like this.
你的控制器中有很多这样的方法。

115
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,672
This one I'm gonna call updateUI.
这个我要调用updateUI。

116
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,275
And the job of this method is just to
这个方法的工作就是

117
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,812
make the model match the UI, tha's i's job.
让模型匹配UI，这是我的工作。

118
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,915
Tha's what this method is gonna do.
这就是这个方法的作用。

119
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,817
So, what do we have to do to make our model,
我们要做什么来做模型，

120
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,586
this facial expression, match our UI?
这个表情，匹配我们的UI ?

121
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,487
Well, we have to deal with the eyes and
我们必须处理好眼睛

122
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,389
we have to deal with the mouth.
我们必须处理好嘴巴。

123
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,960
So, let's deal with the eyes first, that's pretty easy, so,
我们先来处理一下眼睛，这很简单，

124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,664
I'm just going to switch on my expressions.eyes.
我只是想转换一下我的表现。

125
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,701
And in the case that the eyes are open in the model,
在这种情况下，眼睛是在模型中打开的，

126
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,539
then it's easy, I can just take my faceView and
这很简单，我可以用faceView

127
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,444
set it's eyesOpen to true, that's obvious how we do that.
把它看得很清楚，很明显我们就是这么做的。

128
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,048
And this face, you remember, is this outlet,
这张脸，你记得，是这个出口，

129
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,552
that I just created there, and so, that's obvious.
我刚在那里创建的，很明显。

130
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,922
How about the case where the eyes are closed in the model?
在模型中闭上眼睛的情况如何?

131
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,457
Well, that's the faceView.eyesOpen,
嗯,这是faceView.eyesOpen,

132
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,493
are gonna be false.
会是假的。

133
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,729
And finally, there's this case in the model
最后，在模型中有这个例子

134
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,900
where we're squinting, and here,
在这里，

135
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,236
I don't really have a way to represent that.
我没有一个方法来表示它。

136
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,038
So I'm just going to say that in that case our eyes
我想说的是，在这种情况下我们的眼睛

137
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,642
are gonna be closed because, squinting is more like having
会关闭吗，眯眼更像有

138
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,944
your eyes closed than having them open.
你的眼睛闭上了，没有睁开。

139
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,481
But we don't always have exactly the view we want to
但我们并不总是有我们想要的观点

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,517
represent our model, so we're doing the best we can here.
代表我们的模型，所以我们在这里做的最好。

141
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,888
So that is the eyes, pretty straightforward.
这就是眼睛，很简单。

142
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,756
Now the mouth, I could do the same thing for
现在，我可以做同样的事情

143
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,125
the mouth here, case expression.mouth,
这里的嘴，用例表示，

144
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,394
if it's a grin, set the mouth curvature to this.
如果是咧着嘴笑，那就把嘴弯成这样。

145
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,130
If it's normal, set the mouth curvature to that,
如果是正常的，把嘴的曲率设为，

146
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,198
but that code is kind of messy,
但这个代码有点乱，

147
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,704
(make some space here so it's up higher), what if

148
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,976
I created a little private var here, actually make it a let.
我在这里创建了一个私有var，让它变成一个。

149
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,513
And I'm gonna call it mouthCurvatures, and
我把它叫做口曲率

150
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,015
it's gonna be a dictionary, and in the dictionary,
它将是一本字典，在字典里，

151
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:37,822
the values are gonna be FacialExpression.MouthPositi-
值会FacialExpression.MouthPositi -

152
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,625
ons, maybe a grin.
国家统计局,也许一个笑容。

153
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,594
And the value is gonna be a mouth curvature, so
它的值是一个口曲率

154
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,929
what's a good thing for a grin?
笑什么好呢?

155
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,964
I think I decided 0.5.
我想我确定了0。5。

156
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,634
So this is just gonna be a dictionary with
所以这就是一本字典

157
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,705
mouth position in the model, mouthCurvatures for the view.
在模型的口位置，视图的口曲率。

158
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,374
So I'm just creating this little mapping data structure.

159
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,409
So let's do this for all, let's map this.

160
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,811
For all of our facial expressions right here.

161
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,313
Notice, by the way,
注意,顺便说一下,

162
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,818
that Swift was able to infer the type of this dictionary.
那个斯威夫特能够推断出这本字典的类型。

163
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,254
Cuz it only has one item in it, and the types of those two

164
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,724
things are obvious from what they are.
事情是显而易见的。

165
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,028
So now that it knows that, by the way,

166
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,365
we can be a little more succinct and just say like,

169
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,709
Did I get them all?
我都买了吗?

170
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,844
Smirk, how about smirk?
得意的笑,得意的笑呢?

171
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:38,717
Nope, that smirk we'll say is -0.5.
不，那个smirk我们会说- 0。5。

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,119
So I've just put those mouth curvatures in this nice

173
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,087
little table.

It's an optional double.
这是一个可选的两倍。

192
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,337
And that's because this expression might not be
这是因为这个表达式可能不是

193
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,506
in that dictionary.
那本字典。

194
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,508
So I'm gonna use that defaulting thing we learned

199
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,192
When should we call this thing?
我们应该什么时候给它打电话?

200
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,963
Well, we certainly need to call this thing anytime our
嗯，我们当然需要在任何时候给它打电话

201
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,364
model changes.
模型的变化。

202
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,934
If our model changes to have a different expression,
如果我们的模型改变成一个不同的表达式，

203
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,068
we gotta update our UI.
我们必须更新我们的UI。

204
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,836
So how are we gonna do that?
我们要怎么做呢?

205
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,439
We're gonna use this cool feature that I talked about
我们要用这个很酷的功能

206
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:13,478
last time called property observers, this didSet thing.
上次叫财产观察者的是，这个didSet。

207
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,648
So didSet allows you on any of your vars,
所以didSet允许你在任何一个vars上，

208
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,417
if it changes, you can execute some code.
如果它发生变化，您可以执行一些代码。

209
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,019
So anytime someone sets this expression,
每当有人设置这个表达式时，

210
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm just going to update my UI.
我要更新我的UI。

211
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,827
Now, there's one other place that I wanna
现在，还有一个我想要的地方

212
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,564
update my UI though, it's a little less obvious, and
更新我的UI，这有点不太明显

213
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,568
that is with this property observer.

214
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,905
What am I doing here?
我在这里做什么?

215
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,607
This property is the outlet,
这个属性是outlet，

216
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,743
that thing I Ctrl+dragged to my faceView.
我Ctrl +拖动到faceView。

217
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,681
And when we first start up, it's not set.
当我们第一次开始的时候，它不是固定的。

218
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,318
iOS takes a few microseconds to actually connect this up.
iOS只需要几微秒就能将其连接起来。

219
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,487
That's why this is an optional, remember?
这就是为什么这是可选的，记得吗?

220
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:01,492
In that short amount of time, what if the model gets set.
在这么短的时间内，如果模型被设置好了。

221
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,927
Then update UI is not gonna work because the faceView
更新UI不会起作用，因为faceView

222
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,830
hasn't been connected yet.
尚未连接。

223
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,632
So that's no good.
这是没有好。

224
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,836
Also we initialized our FacialExpression to be this.
还初始化了FacialExpression。

225
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:16,741
When you initialize something, didSet does not get called.
当你初始化一些东西时，didSet不会被调用。

226
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,144
didSet is only called if someone externally sets
didSet只有在外部设置时才调用

227
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,445
the expression.
表达式。

228
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,648
The initial thing does not cause it to be set.
初始的东西不会导致它被设置。

229
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,451
So when is didSet gonna happen?
什么时候会发生?

230
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,123
It's gonna happen only once when iOS hooks up this outlet
只有当iOS连接到这个outlet时才会发生

231
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,526
to that faceView, then this didSet is gonna get called.
对于这个faceView，这个didSet会被调用。

232
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,362
That's the only time it's ever gonna get called.
这是它唯一一次被调用。

233
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,764
But at that time, we're gonna update our UI.
但在那个时候，我们要更新UI。

234
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,401
Now, there's one other minor thing here.
现在，这里还有一个小问题。

235
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:51,009
What if this gets called before this happens?
如果这在发生之前被调用了怎么办?

236
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,412
This is gonna crash our program
这会让我们的程序崩溃

237
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,517
because until this gets hooked up to iOS, this is nil.
因为在这个连接到iOS之前，这是nil。

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,055
The only reason we don't have to say exclamation point here
我们不需要在这里写感叹号的唯一原因

239
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,824
is cuz we have this implicitly unwrapped optional here, but
因为我们在这里有一个隐式打开的选项，但是

240
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,092
it is an optional.
这是一个可选的。

241
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,794
So how can we deal with that?
那么我们该如何应对呢?

242
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,263
We don't want update UI to crash our program
我们不需要更新UI来破坏我们的程序

243
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,832
if the expression should happen to be set before that
如果表达式应该在此之前设置

244
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,434
thing gets wired up.
件事被连接起来。

245
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,337
Now that thing gets wired up pretty soon, so
现在这个东西很快就被连接起来了

246
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,639
probably not likely to happen, but it could.
可能不太可能发生，但它可以。

247
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,775
So, we're gonna do that by using this chaining,
我们要用这个链接来做这个，

248
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,544
this optional chaining.
这个可选的链接。

249
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,146
Remember the optional chaining,
记得可选的链接,

250
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,880
where you can put a question mark there.
你可以在那里放一个问号。

251
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,384
And if the thing that you put the question mark on evaluates
如果你把问号放在计算值上

252
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,654
to nil, the rest of that line of code is just ignored.
对于nil，这一行代码的其余部分都被忽略了。

253
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,358
Perfect, faceView?.eyesOpen, if faceView's not set,
完美,faceView ?。eyesOpen，如果faceView没有设置，

254
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,726
we'll just ignore that.
我们会忽略这一点。

255
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,561
We're not gonna set the eyes open to anything,
我们不会让眼睛看到任何东西，

256
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,630
that line is just gonna be aborted immediately.
这一行马上就会被中止。

257
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,768
This is something you often wanna do in your update
这是你经常想在更新中做的事情

258
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,572
UI things is protect against your outlets not being set
UI事物是保护你的outlet不被设置

259
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,880
And it's all gonna be fine, because if this got sent, and
一切都会好起来的，因为如果它被发送了

260
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,882
this has not been, and then this happens, and
这不是，然后这就发生了

261
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,152
none of these lines of code execute, no problem.
这些代码都没有执行，没有问题。

262
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,054
Because when this does get hooked up,
因为当它被连接起来的时候，

263
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,655
this is gonna get called again.
这将再次被调用。

264
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,258
And this time, it'll be able to do it.
这次，它就能做到。

265
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,829
So that it.
所以它。

266
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,797
Let's run our little app here and
让我们在这里运行我们的小程序

267
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,635
see if we get an open eyes grin.
看看我们是不是睁着眼睛笑。

268
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,768
In other words,
换句话说,

269
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,206
let's see if our UI reflects what's in our model.
让我们看看我们的UI是否反映了我们模型中的内容。

270
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,277
And sure enough, open eyes and a little grin.
果然，睁开眼睛，露出一丝笑容。

271
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:38,349
Let's try closed
让我们尝试关闭

272
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:44,389
eyes, closed and

a little frown.
有点皱眉。

274
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,862
Bingo!
宾果!

275
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,966
So now we have done what we need to do in our controller,
现在我们已经做了我们需要在控制器中做的事情，

276
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,502
which is we're interpreting our model for our view.
这就是我们对视图的解释。

277
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,303
And anytime we set the model from now on,
当我们从现在开始建立模型时，

278
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,938
it's gonna update our view automatically.
它会自动更新我们的视图。

279
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,874
So the question is, what if I forgot to put this little
问题是，如果我忘了写这个

280
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,143
question mark right here?
问号呢?

281
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,814
Probably everything would be fine because you don't set
可能一切都会很好，因为你没有设置

282
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,584
your model before that Outlook gets wired up by iOS cuz it
在此之前，你的模型被iOS系统所连接

283
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,253
wires it up really soon.
很快就把它连接起来。

284
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,189
But if you did,
但如果你做了,

285
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,291
And so that's how you would know,
这就是你要知道的，

286
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,159
"oops", you messed that up.

287
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,628
And sometimes you'll forget to put that question mark there,
有时你会忘记把这个问号放在那里，

288
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,180
You do all your coding and you never call that model earlier.
你做了所有的编码，你从来没有提前调用那个模型。

289
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,664
it's fine.
它很好。

290
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,701
But then later, you change your code in a way that
但之后，你会以一种方式改变你的代码

291
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,869
does accept the model before that thing, and boom.
在此之前接受模型，然后繁荣。

292
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,304
It crashes, and you find it right away.
它崩溃了，你马上就能找到它。

293
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,372
That's why crashing is
这就是为什么崩溃

294
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,340
not always the worst thing in the world.
并不总是世界上最糟糕的事情。

295
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,076
Crashing helps you find bugs like that.
崩溃可以帮助你找到类似的bug。

296
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,778
You just hope you don't ship it out, and
你只希望你不要把它运出去

297
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,081
the customers find that bug for you that way.
客户会通过这种方式找到bug。

298
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,949
So that's it, that's all I wanted to do is show
这就是我想要展示的

299
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,351
you now we have a complete MVC.
现在我们有一个完整的MVC。

300
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,053
It's got a model, it's got a view,
它有一个模型，它有一个视图，

301
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,389
it's got a controller that is interpreting for each other.
它有一个控制器来相互解释。

302
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,624
So we can go back to our slides and
我们可以回到幻灯片

303
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,692
learn about gestures, and
了解手势,和

304
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,561
then we'll add some gestures to this thing.
然后我们再加上一些手势。

305
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,735
So, how do we get those touches?
那么，我们如何得到这些触摸呢?

306
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,872
Now, it is possible to get notified
现在，可以得到通知

307
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,575
of raw touch events like a touch, meaning a finger,
像触摸这样的原始触摸事件，也就是指手指，

308
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,646
went down on the screen, it moved, it went up.
在屏幕上，它移动了，它上升了。

309
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,981
Two fingers went down,
两个手指下降,

310
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,351
you can find out all about that, but we never do.
你可以知道这一切，但我们从来没有。

311
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,787
Too complicated, trying to figure out whether this, down,
太复杂了，想弄清楚，

312
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,691
swipe, up is a swipe versus just moving, that's too hard.
滑动，向上是滑动，而只是移动，这太困难了。

313
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,094
So we're gonna let iOS do that for us.
我们让iOS为我们做这个。

314
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,464
And we call that interacting with multi touch,
我们称其为多点触控，

315
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,400
touch via gestures.
通过手势触摸。

316
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,167
So we're not even gonna learn about about the raw
所以我们甚至不能了解原始的情况

317
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,871
touch input in this course, just gestures.
触摸输入在这门课，只是手势。

318
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,341
So gestures are recognized
所以手势识别

319
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,678
by this class called the UIGestureRecognizer.
通过这个类叫做UIGestureRecognizer。

320
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,413
Actually, not by UIGestureRecognizer itself,
实际上，不是UIGestureRecognizer本身，

321
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,015
that's an abstract class.
这是一个抽象类。

322
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,017
How many people know what an abstract class is?
有多少人知道什么是抽象类?

323
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,651
Raise your hand if you know what that is.
如果你知道那是什么，请举手。

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,253
Okay, so I'll take a second to tell ya.
好吧，我花点时间告诉你。

325
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,089
So an abstract class is a class that, it's only
抽象类只是一个类，它只是

326
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,659
purpose in life is to be the super class of other classes.
生活的目的是成为其他阶级的超级阶级。

327
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,097
And you never actually create an abstract class, okay?
实际上你从来没有创建一个抽象类?

328
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,198
You only create subclasses of it,
你只创建了它的子类，

329
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,468
instances of subclasses of it.
它的子类的实例。

330
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,304
So UI gesture recognizer's abstract, you would never
ui手势识别器的抽象，你永远不会

331
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,307
create a UI, you'd never call an initializer on UI gesture
创建一个UI，你不会在UI手势上调用初始化器

332
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,074
recognizer.
识别器。

333
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,009
Instead there's a bunch of subclasses which I'm gonna
相反，我要讲一堆子类

334
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,379
talk about and you would call the initializer on them.
讨论一下，你就会调用初始化器。

335
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,785
Now there's two parts to using a gesture recognizer here.
这里有两个部分使用手势识别器。

336
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,554
One is you have to ask a UIView, please start
一个是你必须要问UIView，请开始

337
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,491
recognizing this gesture, like a swipe or a pan or whatever.
意识到这个手势，就像滑动或平底锅之类的。

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,695
And then number two is, when the recognizer does recognize
第二个是，当识别器识别的时候

339
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,097
it, it wants to call you back with a handler,
它想给你回一个处理器，

340
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,500
what we call a handler, a gesture handler.
我们称之为handler，一个手势处理程序。

341
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,035
So there's the recognizer that you add to a view and
这就是你在视图中添加的识别器

342
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,838
then there's the handler, anybody can be the handler,
然后是处理器，任何人都可以是处理器，

343
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,672
as you'll see.
正如您将看到的。

344
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,343
Almost always it's either the view itself or a controller,
通常它要么是视图本身，要么是控制器，

345
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,278
but anybody could be it.
但任何人都可以做到。

346
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,715
Now the adding of the gesture recognizer is done with
现在添加了手势识别器

347
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,518
a method called add gesture recognizer in UIView.
一种在UIView中添加手势识别器的方法。

348
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,922
And that method is usually called by controllers,
这个方法通常由控制器来调用，

349
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,857
why do controllers call that?
为什么控制器调用这个?

350
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,428
That's because a controller wants to control whether
这是因为控制器想要控制

351
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,198
the things in its view recognize certain gestures.
在它的视图中，事物识别某些手势。

352
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,767
They might wanna turn off certain gestures or or
他们可能会想要关闭某些手势或

353
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,569
not turn on certain gestures, so
所以，不要打开某些手势

354
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,072
the controller is often controlling that.
控制器经常控制它。

355
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,208
But occasionally you do get a UIView that will add
但有时候你会得到一个UIView

356
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,379
a gesture to itself, like scroll view.
像滚动视图一样的手势。

357
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,182
Because a scroll view without the pan gesture, or
因为滚动视图没有平移手势，或者

358
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,718
without the pinching gesture if it can zoom,
没有捏捏手势，如果它能变焦，

359
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,386
it's not even a scroll view.
它甚至不是一个滚动视图。

360
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,920
In other words, that gesture is so
换句话说，这个手势是这样的

361
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,124
fundamental to what a scroll view is that scroll view adds
滚动视图的基本原理是滚动视图

362
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,910
It'd, you'd have some API to turn it off, but it adds it to
它会，你会有一些API来关闭它，但它将它添加到

363
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:43,628
it to itself.
它本身。

364
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:47,297
itself, it doesn't make some controller add this gesture,
它本身并没有让控制器添加这个手势，

365
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,333
it just recognizes pan and pinch.
它只识别平移和缩放。

366
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,135
So mostly it's done by controllers,
大部分都是由控制器完成的，

367
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,369
though you'll see that.
尽管你会发现。

368
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,971
The second thing, the handler,
第二，处理器，

369
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,506
okay that could either be the controller or the view.
可以是控制器，也可以是视图。

370
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,477
And what it really depends on is whether the gesture affects
它真正依赖的是这个手势是否会影响

371
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,445
the model, or
模型中,或

372
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,148
whether the gesture affects just the view, okay.
这个手势是否影响了视图，好的。

373
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,883
If the gesture only affects the view,
如果这个手势只影响到视图，

374
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,586
then the view will probably handle it.
然后视图可能会处理它。

375
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,088
But if the gesture affects the model directly,
但如果这个手势直接影响模型，

376
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,123
now the controller has to
现在控制器必须

377
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,958
handle it because a view can't see the model.
处理它，因为视图看不到模型。

378
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,896
So the handler is either controller view and not, and
handler是控制器视图，不是

379
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:19,830
you'll see that in the demo.
你们会在demo中看到。

380
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,166
I'm gonna have one handler that's a model, one and
我将有一个处理器，它是一个模型，一个和

381
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,869
one that controls view and you'll see where we put them.
一个控制视图，你会看到我们把它们放在哪里。

382
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,839
Alright, so what's the code look like to add a gesture
好的，那么代码是怎样添加一个手势的

383
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,140
recognizer to a view?
识别器视图?

384
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,308
So for my example here,
我举个例子，

385
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,977
let's say you had a view, and in this code I'm gonna
假设你有一个视图，在这个代码中，我要

386
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,246
put here by the way is gonna be in a controller.
顺便提一下，这是一个控制器。

387
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,549
Let's say it has one of its views that it wants to add
假设它有一个它想要添加的视图

388
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,987
a pan gesture, a pan gesture is put your finger down on
一个平移手势，一个平移手势，就是把你的手指放在上面

389
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,255
the screen and move around.
屏幕和移动。

390
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,625
That's called panning around in the view.
这就是所谓的平移。

391
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:54,365
So this is what it looks like, a good place to add a gesture
这就是它看起来的样子，一个添加手势的好地方

392
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:59,470
recognizer is in the didSet of an outlet for that view.
识别器位于该视图的一个出口的didSet中。

393
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,740
Because that's, as soon as you can get a hold of it anyway,
因为，一旦你能得到它，

394
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,476
your iOS just sets, set that outlet up for you, so
你的iOS只是设置，为你设置outlet，所以

395
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,545
now you've got a hold of that view.
现在你已经掌握了这一观点。

396
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,413
Now you can send a message to that view,
现在你可以发送一条消息到那个视图，

397
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,048
addGestureRecognizer.
addGestureRecognizer。

398
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,318
Here I have this var, this outlet called pannableView,
这里有一个var，这个outlet叫pannableView，

399
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,055
this is the view that I wanna add the pan gesture to.
这是我想要添加平移手势的视图。

400
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,457
And you can see that in its didSet,
你可以看到它的didSet，

401
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,826
in other words when iOS wires this up,
换句话说，当iOS连接起来的时候，

402
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,829
I'm going to do this addGestureRecognizer.
我要做这个addGestureRecognizer。

403
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,799
First I'm gonna create the gesture recognizer,
首先我要创建手势识别器，

404
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,269
notice I'm saying UIPanGestureRecognizer, in it,
注意，我说的是UIPanGestureRecognizer，

405
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,904
in the initializer for that.
在初始化器中。

406
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,074
Not UIGestureRecognizer, I'm creating a concrete
不是UIGestureRecognizer，我在创建一个具体的

407
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,309
gesture recognizer which is for panning.
手势识别器用于平移。

408
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,312
And that it has two arguments, the both of these arguments
它有两个参数，这两个参数

409
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,682
are the handler, how this thing is handled.
是处理器，它是怎么处理的。

410
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,117
The target is who's gonna handle it, and
目标是谁来处理它，和

411
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,354
the action is what method is going to handle it.
方法就是处理它的方法。

412
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,989
So now in the case here, the target,
现在在这里，目标，

413
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,758
I'm having the target will be myself, the view controller.
我的目标是我自己，视图控制器。

414
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,127
This is obviously in the view controller because this is in
这显然在视图控制器中，因为它在

415
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,395
an outlet property observer,
一个出口财产观察者,

416
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,364
that would only make sense in a view controller.
这在视图控制器中是很有意义的。

417
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,634
And so the target is myself, I'm going to set,
所以目标是我自己，我要设置，

418
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,037
ask when this pan gestures starts to be recognized
问一下这个手势什么时候开始被识别

419
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:11,108
it's gonna be sending me the action here to handle it.
它会发送给我这里的操作来处理它。

420
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:15,278
And the action, you notice you have to say #selector to
这个动作，你注意到你必须选择# selector

421
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,914
specify the method.
指定的方法。

422
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,750
Don't get confused the difference between a function
不要混淆函数之间的区别

423
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,152
type, a type that is a function and
类型，是一个函数和

424
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,755
an actual method in a class.
一个类中的实际方法。

425
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,292
We use #selector to say this is a method,
我们使用# selector表示这是一个方法，

426
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,229
I wanna call this specific method in my class.
我想在课堂上讲这个具体方法。

427
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,898
And notice I've said ViewController.pan(
注意，我已经说过了viewcontroller . pan(

428
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,569
recognizer:), well that means that the method that's gonna
识别器:)，这意味着这个方法

429
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,003
be called is called pan.
被称为pan。

430
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,041
And it has one argument, whose external name is recognizer:
它有一个参数，它的外部名字是识别器:

431
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,876
that's what that means.
这是什么意思。

432
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,980
The ViewController., means that method is in myself.
ViewController。，方法就是我自己。

433
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,650
If it was in my view it would probably be like
如果在我看来，可能会是这样

434
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,752
PannableView.whatever.
PannableView.whatever。

435
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,055
This could also be self.pan, that's allowed,
这也可以是自我。锅,这是允许的,

436
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,658
saying pan.panGesture, pan recognizer in myself.
说锅。panGesture,pan识别器在我自己。

437
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,562
Also you could omit it, that part in totally and
你也可以省略它，这部分是完全的

438
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,764
just say panRecognizer: because the default is for
只是说pan识别器:因为默认是for

439
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,933
it to be in myself.
它属于我自己。

440
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,668
So there's three ways I could have specified that,
我有三种方法来说明，

441
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,239
viewController.pan, self.pan, or just pan.
viewController。锅、自我。锅,或者只是平底锅。

442
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,674
But notice it does have that argument by the way,
但是注意它确实有这个论证，

443
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,678
that argument is gonna be the recognizer passed back to me.
这个参数就是我返回的识别器。

444
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,347
So when the pan starts to be recognized, it's gonna call
当pan开始被识别时，它会调用

445
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,150
this method, and that recognizer is gonna be passed.
这个方法，那个识别器会被传递。

446
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,220
This pan gesture recognizer called panGestureRecognizer
这个手势识别器被称为panGestureRecognizer

447
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,289
right there, that's gonna be passed back to me each time.
就在那里，每次都会传回给我。

448
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,325
Now I've got a gesture recognizer for
现在我有了一个手势识别器

449
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,162
panning, I just add it to the view,
平移，我把它加到视图上，

450
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:42,599
only views are capable of recognizing gestures.
只有视图才能识别手势。

451
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,768
So if you have a gesture recognizer,
如果你有一个手势识别器，

452
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,339
the only addGestureRecognizer method in the entire UI kit is
在整个UI工具包中唯一的addGestureRecognizer方法是

453
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,108
in UIView, so you have to send it to UIView, or
在UIView中，你必须把它发送给UIView

454
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,576
a subclass of UIView.
UIView的一个子类。

455
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,880
Let's talk about the handling, so now this is code,
我们来讨论一下处理，这是代码，

456
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:57,948
adds the handler so
添加处理程序,所以

457
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,685
that the view is gonna start looking for pan gestures.
这个视图将开始寻找平移手势。

458
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,053
And then when it finds them,
当它发现它们的时候，

459
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,189
it's going to start calling this pan recognizer.
它将开始调用这个pan识别器。

460
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,025
Now before we can look at the code for
在我们看代码之前

461
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,861
that we gotta understand a few things about it.
我们必须了解一些事情。

462
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,830
One is that when you get a gesture like a pan or
一种是当你做手势时，像平底锅

463
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,034
a pinch you need some concrete subclass specific information
必要时，您需要一些具体的子类特定信息

464
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,403
about it like a pan.
就像平底锅一样。

465
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,638
You gotta know where it is, or a pinch,
你必须知道它在哪里，或者缩放，

466
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,974
you gotta know much you pinched.
你得知道你掐了多少。

467
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,944
So we have to understand what that means,
所以我们必须明白这意味着什么，

468
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,681
now for a pan gesture recognizer, there are three.
现在，对于一个平移手势识别器，有三个。

469
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,383
It's actually a little more, but there's this three very
实际上还有一点，但这三个非常

470
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,086
important pieces of concrete information about the pan.
关于平底锅的重要信息。

471
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,524
So, translation(in: UIView) is a function in the pan gesture
所以，平移(在UIView中)是平移手势的函数

472
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,793
recognizer where you can ask it,
你可以问这个问题，

473
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,296
how far has this pan moved since it started.
这个盘子从开始到现在有多远。

474
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,466
How far has it moved from the start as I'm moving around,
当我移动的时候，它从一开始移动了多远，

475
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,369
x and y, it's a CG point, so it's giving me the x and
x和y，它是一个重心，所以它给了我x和

476
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,172
y where it's moved to since it started.
y从它开始的地方开始。

477
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,408
Velocity says how fast is the finger moving.
速度表示手指移动的速度。

478
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,077
Is it kind of whipping it around or
这是一种鞭笞吗

479
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,312
is it going really slow?
进展真的很慢吗?

480
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,913
Because if it's going really slow,
因为如果速度很慢，

481
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,348
maybe you wanna do a very you know, small drawing.
也许你想做一个非常小的画。

482
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,683
And if he's whipping it really fast and
如果他真的快速地鞭打它

483
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,818
you just wanna you know, moves something around, who knows?
你只是想知道，移动一些东西，谁知道呢?

484
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,221
And then there's setTranslation,
然后调用setTranslation,

485
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,724
now this last one is kinda cool because
最后一个有点酷，因为

486
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,027
if you just know the start point and where it's moved to.
如果你知道起始点和它移动到哪里。

487
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,397
You're not really getting the incremental move with
你并没有真正得到增量的移动

488
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,832
each time you update,
每次你更新,

489
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,968
so you can actually set that translation to zero.
所以你可以把它设为零。

490
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,404
And then instead of getting the distance from the origin,
而不是距离原点的距离，

491
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,606
you're getting from the distance from the last time
从上次的距离开始

492
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,508
this was sent to you.
这是发给你的。

493
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,043
Cuz this handler's going to be sent to you over and
因为这个处理器会被发送给你

494
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,513
over as the pan moves around repeatedly.
当锅反复移动的时候。

495
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,248
Hundreds of times as you move move around, so
当你移动时，数百次

496
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,651
often you'll wanna set that translation back to zero,
通常你会把它设为0，

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,421
it gives you incremental panning.
它给你增加的平移。

498
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,890
You'll see that with some of the other concrete
你会看到一些其他的混凝土

499
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,408
Now, the abstract superclass, the UIGestureRecognizer,
现在，抽象的超类，UIGestureRecognizer，

500
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,858
ones as well.
的。

501
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,729
even though you don't make one it still is the superclass of
即使你不做，它仍然是超类的

502
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,463
these things.
这些事情。

503
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,631
And you do inherit,
和你继承,

504
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,969
especially this one very important var, Called state.
尤其是这个非常重要的变量，叫做状态。

505
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,504
And a state tells you the state of the gesture's,
一个状态告诉你这个手势的状态，

506
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,273
how it's being recognized.
它是如何被认可。

507
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,875
So all of these gesture recognizers start out in
所有的手势识别器都是从这里开始的

508
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,845
the state possible.
可能的状态。

509
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,614
It's possible this gesture could happen.
这个手势有可能会发生。

510
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,917
And then, once it starts if it's a continuous gesture
然后，一旦它开始，如果它是一个连续的手势

511
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,687
like a pan or a pinch you go to the state began.
就像一个平底锅，或者你去国家的时候。

512
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,789
So this isn't like, " a pan!, I think it's started".
所以这不是“一个平底锅!”我想这已经开始了。

513
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,392
So you'll get your handlers called and you can look at
你会让你的处理器被调用，你可以看看

514
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,195
the state of the recognizer and say, it began.
识别器的状态说，它开始了。

515
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,031
And then, every time the finger moves,
然后，每次手指移动，

516
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,832
it's gonna get changed.
它会得到改变。

517
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,001
It gets change, change, change, change, change,
它变了，变了，变了，变了，变了，

518
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:31,769
change, change.
改变,改变。

519
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,071
You're getting your handler called repeatedly and
你会不断地调用你的处理程序

520
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,473
no anything that's changing is those methods above,
没有任何改变是上述方法，

521
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,609
translation and also the state.
翻译和国家。

522
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,343
Moves to change.
行动改变。

523
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,045
And then, when the finger goes up, you get ended.
然后，当手指向上的时候，你就结束了。

524
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,348
You'll get your handler called and the state will be ended.
你会得到你的处理程序，然后状态就会结束。

525
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:50,254
Now, for a discrete gesture like a swipe,
现在，对于一个离散的手势，像滑动，

526
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,189
a swipe either happened or not.
滑动要么发生，要么不发生。

527
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,157
When you're looking at a swipe you don't get
当你看的时候，你不会得到

528
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,893
the swipe started and it's moving across the screen and
滑动开始，它在屏幕上移动

529
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,094
it comes off, no.
说,没有。

530
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,396
Either the swipe happened or not.
无论是否发生滑动。

531
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,297
So you would just get called once and
你只需要调用一次

532
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,501
the stage is gonna go straight to being ended or recognized.
舞台将会直接走向终结或被认可。

533
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,273
But you have to be a little bit careful of the states
但是你要注意这些状态

534
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,643
failed and cancelled.
失败,取消了。

535
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,212
Failed might be because you started a gesture and
失败可能是因为你开始了一个手势

536
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,647
then the system realized, my gosh,
然后系统意识到，我的天，

537
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,749
that wasn't a pan gesture, that was the start of a swipe.
那不是一个泛泛的手势，那是一种滑动的开始。

538
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,984
Or something like that.
之类的。

539
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,286
And so, it switches to a swipe.
所以，它切换到滑动。

540
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,623
So you could have canceled, and then the other one,
所以你可以取消，然后另一个，

541
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,526
or the failed, and then you also didn't have canceled.
或者失败了，然后你也没有取消。

542
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,429
You're in the middle of panning, phone call comes in,
你在淘金的过程中，电话打进来了，

543
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,666
takes over your screen, person says, hello, how you doing?
接管你的屏幕，有人说，你好，你好吗?

544
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,102
Well, clearly, that pan gesture was canceled.
很明显，这个手势被取消了。

545
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,437
So you could get that, as well.
你也可以得到这个。

546
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,973
So if you ever do anything, when you gesture ends,
所以如果你做任何事情，当你做手势的时候，

547
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,709
then you have to be careful to clean up when it fails, or
然后，当它失败时，你必须小心清理

548
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,010
gets canceled, as well.
被取消了。

549
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,946
So that's the state.
这是国家所有。

550
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,549
So let's take a look then, knowing what we know about pan
那么让我们来看看，了解我们对潘的了解

551
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,684
gestures, what the handler would look like.
手势，处理器会是什么样子。

552
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,521
So remember that the handler is called pan,
记住这个处理程序叫做pan，

553
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,990
recognizer is the argument there, and that is the pan
识别器是这里的参数，这是平移

554
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,425
gesture recognizer itself coming back to us.
手势识别器会自动回到我们身边。

555
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,194
And its state will be different,
它的状态会不同，

556
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,329
and we can ask it about translation and view and
我们可以问它关于平移和视图

557
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,497
all those things.
所有这些事情。

558
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,668
So the first thing we're gonna do is look at that state and
我们要做的第一件事就是看看那个状态

559
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,436
I'm going to do the same thing whether the pan is,
我要做同样的事情，

560
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,839
has changed or whether the finger went up.
发生了变化，或者手指是否向上。

561
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,407
That's kinda the last position of the pan,
这是pan的最后一个位置，

562
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,242
we're gonna do the exact same thing.
我们要做同样的事情。

563
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,179
Notice by the way I'm using this switch thing fallthrough,
注意，我使用这个开关的时候，

564
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,214
hopefully you got that in your reading assignment.
希望你们在阅读作业中得到了这个。

565
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,584
That basically just means that you wanna fall through to
那基本上只是意味着你想要失败

566
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,587
the next case cuz in a lot of languages that's the default,
下一个案例是很多语言中都是默认的，

567
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,022
but in Swift it's not the default,
但在Swift，它不是默认值，

568
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,223
you don't fall through.
你不会失败。

569
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,791
So fallthrough makes you fall through,
所以，fallthrough让你失败，

570
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,359
it's a special key word.
这是一个特别的关键词。

571
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,863
You could also say case.changed.ended: that
你也可以说case.changed。结束:

572
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,397
would probably be actually better.
可能会更好。

573
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,299
We'll do that in the demo.
我们会在demo中演示。

574
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,072
So if the pan moves a little or it ends, then I'm going to
所以如果平移了一点点，或者它结束了，那么我就会

575
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,676
get the translation from where we started at first
从我们开始的地方开始翻译

576
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,479
by asking for the translation in the pannable view.
通过在pannable视图中请求翻译。

577
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,815
That's the view the pan is having there.
这是pan在那里的观点。

578
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:58,949
You're almost always gonna ask for
你几乎总是要问

579
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,718
the translation in the pannable view.
在pannable视图中的翻译。

580
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,185
But you could ask for it in other views and
但你可以在其他视图中要求它

581
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,388
it will convert to that view's coordinate system if you want.
如果你想，它会转换到那个视图的坐标系统。

582
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,190
But almost always you're asking for
但几乎总是你在要求

583
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,259
the one in the pannable view.
在可控制的视图中。

584
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,695
Then, I'm gonna take that translation that I'm gonna
然后，我要把我要做的翻译

585
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,164
move and I'm gonna go do something with my app.
移动，我要用我的app做点什么。

586
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:14,965
Draw a line to,

587
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,267
if I'm tracking the finger with the line, or
如果我用这条线来跟踪手指

588
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,702
if I'm moving something,
如果我要搬东西,

589
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,104
I'm gonna move the thing to the new position.
我要把它移到新的位置。

590
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,974
Then, if I want, I can set translation to zero so
然后，如果我想，我可以把translation设为0

591
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,243
the next time this handler is called,
下一次调用这个处理程序时，

592
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,179
the translation is gonna be just the distance from
平移距离为

593
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,782
the last time it was called.
上次叫它的时候。

594
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,717
As opposed to the distance from where it all started.

595
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,352
Where the pan started.
锅里开始的地方。

596
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,454
So that's it.
这就是它。

597
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,090
That's how a handler works, it's easy.
这就是处理程序的工作方式，很简单。

598
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,126
Let's talk a little bit about some of the other concrete
让我们来谈谈另一些具体的东西

599
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:46,163
gestures.
手势。

600
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,932
So I put my fingers down, two fingers on the screen.
所以我把手指放下，两个手指在屏幕上。

601
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,968
Now, the scale is 1.0.
现在，刻度是1。0。

602
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,370
If I put my fingers twice as far apart,
如果我把手指分开两倍，

603
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,971
now the scale is 2.0.
现在规模是2.0。

604
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,108
If I go down to half as small now, the scale is 0.5.
如果现在减小到一半，刻度是0。5。

605
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,876
So that's what pinch is doing.
这就是缩放的作用。

606
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,179
It just constantly reporting what the scale is,
它只是不断地报道规模是什么，

607
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,147
relative to what the pinch started.
相对于缩放的开始。

608
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,482
Now, that scale is not read-only var, so
这个比例不是只读var

609
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,884
you can reset it as well.
你也可以重置它。

610
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,587
And then, you'll get incremental scale.
然后，你会得到增量的规模。

611
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,923
How much the scale has changed since the last time?
自上次以来，规模有多大变化?

612
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,693
There's almost like you keep resetting the initial finger
几乎就像你不停地重新设置手指

613
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,663
down, to scale, if you set that scale to one.
向下，按比例，如果你把这个比例设置为1。

614
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:22,199
That's how you can get incremental scale.
这就是如何得到增量的规模。

615
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,433
We'll do that in the demo as well.
我们在demo中也会这样做。

616
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,602
And then, you also get velocity.
然后，你也得到了速度。

617
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,839
How many points for a second or whatever this thing is, or
这一秒有多少个点，或者是什么

618
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,074
not really a point fact.
这并不是一个真正的问题。

619
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,042
It's a scale factor.
这是一个比例因子。

620
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,478
The percent of scale is changing,
比例在变化，

621
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,046
how fast it's changing per second.
每秒变化有多快。

622
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,482
There's also a rotation gesture that's two fingers
还有一个旋转手势，两个手指

623
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,452
down, like turning a knob.
就像转动一个旋钮。

624
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,254
Keep the two fingers down.
把这两个手指放下来。

625
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:44,921
You turn them.
你把他们。

626
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,690
You get the rotation there.
就得到了旋转。

627
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,492
The rotation is in radians.
旋转是弧度。

628
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,161
Again, it's not read only so you could reset it and
同样，它不是只读的所以你可以重置它

629
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,263
get the incremental turning.
增量转动。

630
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,432
And you also get the velocity and radians per second.
你也会得到速度和每秒弧度。

631
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,501
How fast the person is turning their knob.
这个人转动旋钮的速度有多快。

632
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,471
There's also SwipeGesture, and again this is discrete so
还有swipe手势，这也是离散的

633
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,108
your handler's only gonna be called once.
你的处理器只会被调用一次。

634
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,677
If it recognizes this gesture.
如果它意识到这个手势。

635
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,777
Now, because of that,
现在,因此,

636
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,213
you have to configure a SwipeGesture recognizer.
您必须配置一个swipe手势识别器。

637
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,014
You create it and
你创建它,

638
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,484
then you wanna set bars here like direction.
然后你想在这里设置像方向这样的。

639
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,386
You wanna left swipe, right swipe, up, down.
你想要向左滑动，右击，向上，向下。

640
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,554
And how many fingers?
有多少个手指?

641
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,588
Two finger swipe?
两个手指滑动?

642
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,324
Three finger swipe?
三个手指滑动?

643
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,942
You set all that up when you create it because then it's
当你创建它的时候，你设置了所有这些，因为它是

644
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,493
One finger swipe?
一个手指滑动?

645
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,728
just gonna be looking for that.
只是为了寻找那个。

646
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,197
And when it finds it, it's gonna call your handler once.
当它找到它的时候，它会调用你的处理器一次。

647
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,465
Cuz it's discrete.
因为它是离散的。

648
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,001
Then there's tap gesture, similar to the swipe gesture
然后是tap手势，类似于滑动手势

649
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,137
in that you have to configure it.
你必须配置它。

650
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,639
Number of taps, like is it a double tap and
水龙头的数量，就像一个双龙头

651
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,275
is it two finger tap, you do that.
是两个手指轻拍，你这样做。

652
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,711
And then, it's gonna call, this is not purely a discrete
然后，它会调用，这不仅仅是一个离散的

653
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,381
gesture, like SwipeGesture, really you're looking for
手势，像游泳姿势，真的是你在找

654
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,685
the state ended with a tap as well, but
这个州也以tap告终，但是

655
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,654
still you have to preconfigure it like a swipe, so
但你还是要像刷卡一样预配置它

656
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,490
it behaves almost exactly like a discrete gesture.
它的行为几乎完全像一个离散的手势。

657
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,828
So hopefully this will make a lot more sense when we show in
所以希望当我们展示的时候，这会更有意义

658
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,563
the demo here, our demo we're gonna add three gestures,
演示，我们的演示，我们要添加三个手势，

659
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,766
one is a pinch, that's just gonna make the face bigger and
一个是缩放，这将会使脸部变得更大

660
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,968
Which has nothing to do with a model that view only so
这与一个只有视图的模型没有关系

661
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,102
smaller.
小。

662
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,672
we're gonna put that handler in the view.
我们将把这个处理程序放在视图中。

663
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:13,176
And then, we gonna do pan, moving around.
然后，我们要做平移，移动。

664
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,878
Actually no, we're gonna swipe instead of pan.
不，我们要用刷卡，而不是用平底锅。

665
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,779
Let's use swipe.
让我们用刷。

666
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,915
We do swipe and we swipe up to make our face happier or
我们刷卡，向上滑动，让我们的脸更快乐

667
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,183
swipe down to make it sadder.
向下滑动，让它更悲伤。

668
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,985
And we'll have tab to open and close your eyes.
我们会让tab打开，闭上你的眼睛。

669
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,153
How about that?
怎么样?

670
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,388
And those last two are obviously gonna affect
最后两个显然会产生影响

671
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,458
the model, so the'll have to be handled by the controller.
模型，所以必须由控制器来处理。

672
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,994
So le's go back to our code where we were here and
所以，le回到我们在这里的代码

673
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,396
how we can do this.
我们该怎么做。

674
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,633
Le's do the pinch first.
先缩放。

675
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,469
Now, the pinch does't affect the model, so
现在，缩放不会影响模型

676
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,837
it can be handled by the view.
它可以由视图来处理。

677
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,839
So le's actually go over to our view and
因此，le实际上是去了我们的视图

678
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:48,044
start by writing a handler for a pinch.
首先编写一个缩放处理程序。

679
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,880
I'm gonna call this handler func changeScale because
我把它命名为handler func changeScale，因为

680
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,683
that's what it's gonna do, it's gonna be a pinch.
这就是它将要做的，它将会是一个缩放。

681
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:59,589
So it's gonna change the scale of our head.
所以它会改变我们大脑的大小。

682
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:05,796
And I'm gonna say byReactingTo a pinchRecognizer,
我要说的是，对一个pinch识别器，

683
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,932
Which will be UI pinch recognizer,
这将是UI缩放识别器，

684
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:14,904
pinch gesture recognizer, there we go.
缩放手势识别器，好了。

685
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,440
So this is gonna be my handler.
这是我的处理器。

686
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,777
So it's gonna get this pinch sent back to me all the time.
所以它会一直给我发送这个缩放。

687
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,712
I'm not gonna look at that pinch of scale to know
我不打算看这个缩放比例

688
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,714
how much to scale my own scale.
多大程度上我自己的规模。

689
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:32,321
So I'm gonna switch on the pinch recognizer's state.
我将打开缩放识别器的状态。

690
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,358
Remember, it inherits that from UI gesture recognizer,
记住，它是从ui手势识别器继承的，

691
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,560
which is the super class of this.
这是它的超类。

692
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,696
And in the case that it is changed, so
在这种情况下，它改变了

693
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,532
the pinch has changed, or
缩放改变了，或者

694
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,869
if it's ended, which means the user lifted the fingers off.
如果它结束了，这意味着用户将手指移开。

695
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,307
Neither of those cases I'm gonna adjust my scale
这两种情况都不会调整我的量表

696
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,344
by whatever the scale is of the pinchRecognizer.
按比例来衡量pinch识别器。

697
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,247
Simple as that.
就这么简单。

698
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:04,320
Now the thing about this though, what if
现在关于这个的问题，如果

699
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,425
I start my pinch here 1.0, and I move it just a little bit.
我在这里开始缩放1。0，然后移动一点点。

700
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,058
Okay, fine.
好的,很好。

701
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,961
My scale gets moved just a little bit.
我的尺度移动了一点点。

702
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,896
What if I moved all the way out to scale 2.0?
如果我一直走到2.0版呢?

703
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,764
Now my face gets 2.0.
现在我的脸得到2.0。

704
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,634
Now what if I move it out to 2.1?
如果把它移动到1。2呢?

705
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:23,373
This code's gonna make my face go from 2.1 to 4.2 you see.
这段代码会让我的脸从2.1到4.2。

706
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,543
So I need to keep resetting this scale back to 1 all
所以我需要把这个比例重新设置为1

707
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,713
the time so I'm getting incremental scale changes.
时间是变化的。

708
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,949
So I'm gonna say pinch recognizer .scale = 1.
我用缩放识别器。规模= 1。

709
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,718
So I'm just constantly resetting.
所以我一直在重新设置。

710
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,687
Every time this gets called, and
每次都被调用

711
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,490
I move my scale up, I'm gonna reset the scale so
我移动我的刻度，我将重置缩放比例

712
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,426
that I'm starting at one again with my pinch.
我要重新开始。

713
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,963
That gives me incremental scaling there.
这给了我增量的缩放。

714
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,500
And of course we have to handle all the other cases
当然我们还要处理其他的情况

715
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,300
of the state.
的状态。

716
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,302
But I'm not gonna do anything.
但我什么都不想做。

717
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,270
So I'm not gonna do anything when the pinch starts.
所以当缩放开始时，我什么都不做。

718
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,906
If it gets cancelled, I don't care.
如果它被取消了，我不在乎。

719
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,640
I'll just leave it whatever scale it was
不管它的规模是多少

720
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,475
in at the time, etc.
在当时，等等。

721
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,512
So I don't need to really handle any other cases.
所以我不需要处理其他的情况。

722
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,146
So that's it.
这就是它。

723
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,849
The handlers are super easy to write.
处理程序非常容易编写。

724
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,750
And this scale by the way,
这个尺度，

725
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,420
everyone understands, is this scale right here, this bar.
每个人都明白，这个比例就是这个。

726
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,521
This is our scale.
这是我们的规模。

727
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:14,758
Questions about that?
问题吗?

728
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,793
So now we have a handler.
现在我们有了一个处理器。

729
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,030
We have someone to handle when a pinch happens in the view.
在视图中出现缩放时，我们需要有人处理。

730
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:24,768
Now all we need to do is add a recognizer that recognizes
现在我们需要添加一个识别器

731
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,070
a pinch, and calls the handler.
一个缩放，并调用处理器。

732
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,639
So we're gonna do that up here in our face views
我们将在我们的面部视图中做这个

733
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,175
didSet, because this is the first time we got a hold of
didSet，因为这是我们第一次得到

734
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,777
that face view, and I want the face view to be the one
那面视图，我想让它的面视图为1

735
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,681
that is recognizing this pinch.
这就是意识到这一点。

736
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,583
So let's start by creating the handlers, so
让我们从创建处理程序开始

737
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,618
I'm going to create a local variabilities to make it clear

740
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,429
changeScalebyReactingTo, that's my handler.
changeScalebyReactingTo,那是我的处理程序。

741
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,433
And then I am going to create a recognizer here,
然后我要在这里创建一个识别器，

742
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,069
a pinch recognizer and
一撮识别器和

743
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:03,073
it's going to be a UIPinchGestureRecognizer and
它将是一个UIPinchGestureRecognizer和

744
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,641
of course we need the target and the action.
我们当然需要目标和行动。

745
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,744
That's all we need to create a recognizer.
我们需要创建一个识别器。

746
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,714
The target is going to be the faceView,
目标是faceView，

747
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,083
it's gonna handle this thing itself, and
它会自己处理这个问题

748
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,786
the action is gonna be this handler.
动作将是这个处理器。

749
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,455
That's it.
就是这样。

750
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,991
Now we just need to take the faceView and
现在我们只需要使用faceView

751
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,628
add GestureRecognizer, the pinchRecognizer.
添加手势识别器,pinchRecognizer。

752
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,264
And by doing that,
通过这样做,

753
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,899
face view is gonna start recognizing pinches.
face view将会开始识别pinches。

754
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,568
And when it recognizes one, it's gonna send this handler

755
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,038
message right here to the face view.
这里的信息到face view。

756
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:40,543

759
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,055
if I have a mouse here, how do I do a pinch?

760
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,723
In my thing, okay?

761
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,858
Well the magic there is option.

And they kinda stay the same apart.
它们保持着相同的距离。

766
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,167
You can also do option shift, and they'll offset them, so

767
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,702
you can pinch anywhere you want.

776
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,322
Let's start by going to our FaceView and
我们先从FaceView开始

777
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,691
putting a break point right here in our handler Bar.

It broke.
就坏了。

783
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,339
It's definitely calling my handler.

784
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,173
So what's the problem?
所以有什么问题?

785
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:44,974
Let's do nothing.
我们什么都不做。

786
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,443
Let's say let's print our scale and

Cuz we know it's working.
因为我们知道它在起作用。

801
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:29,052
It's because when you change a var, like scale, right

802
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,391
here it does not automatically know to redraw your view.

811
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,446
my face I told you this is the only way to draw.

00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,185
And how are we gonna do that?
我们要怎么做呢?

815
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,292
any time scale get called, we're gonna do a didSet.

817
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,631
cause ourself to get drawn.

00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,645
Anyone remember from the slides?
有人记得幻灯片吗?

825
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,048
SetNeedsDisplay.
SetNeedsDisplay。

826
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,152
So we're telling the system something about us has

827
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,455
changed, we need to be re-displayed.

831
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:54,204
Any time any of these public things get changed by someone,

Let's put this comment up here.
我们把这个注释放在这里。

00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,910
So this is very common to have this little snippet of code

835
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,746
after any var, that when you change it,

841
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:24,567
Here I go on option again, and sure enough, look, our scale.
在这里，我再次选择，当然，看，我们的规模。

842
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,703
Since our scale changes here, that setNeedsDisplay is
因为我们这里的尺度变化，所以setNeedsDisplay是

843

844
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,143
That's pretty cool,
这是很酷,

845
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,413
that was quite simple to put in that gesture to do that.
这样做很简单。

846
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,082
So let's go back now to our controller, and
现在回到控制器

847
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:45,021
think about doing a gesture like a tap, to open the eyes.
想一下做个手势，像水龙头一样，让眼睛睁开。

848
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,391
Now again, the view could be the handler for that.
现在，视图可以是这个的处理程序。

849
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,260
It arguably knows how to open an close its eyes.
可以说，它知道如何闭上眼睛。

850
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,229
But if we made the view be the handler for a tap, and it
但如果我们让视图成为一个tap的处理器，那么它

851
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,866
opened the eyes, it would get out of sync with the model.
打开眼睛，它就会与模型不同步。

852
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,569
Cuz the model is what says whether the eyes are open,
因为模型是说眼睛是否睁开，

853
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,303
not the face view.
不是脸的观点。

854
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,770
Face view is a slave.
Face view是一个奴隶。

855
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,205
It's a minion of the controller,
它是控制器的一个minion，

856
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,907
it's supposed to do what the controller wants, so
它应该做控制器想要的，所以

857
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:05,642
we can't do that.
我们不能这样做。

858
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,678
So we're gonna have to have the controller handle a tap,
所以我们要让控制器控制水龙头，

859
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,712
and change it in the model.
然后在模型中改变它。

860
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,248
And then it'll automatically

861
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,384
update in the UI because of this line of code right here.
在UI中更新因为这一行代码。

862
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,055
Any time we change our model it's gonna update our UI.
任何时候改变模型都会更新UI。

863
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,624
So we're gonna just have to have a handler for
我们需要一个处理程序

864
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,193
tap that just changes our model.
点击它可以改变我们的模式。

865
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,296
And that's all it needs to do.
这就是它需要做的。

866
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,332
Let's try that handler first.
让我们先试试那个处理器。

867
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,702
Let's call that handler, how about toggleEyes
让我们调用这个处理程序，toggleEyes

868
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,671
cuz we're gonna tap and it's gonna with the eyes.
因为我们要用它，用眼睛。

869
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,206
If its opened it'll close, close it'll open.

870
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:42,345
And toggleEyes is a tapGestureRecognizer thing,
toggleEyes是一个tapGestureRecognizer的东西，

871
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:47,016
so I'm gonna say byReacting to a tapRecognizer
所以我要对一个tap识别器做出反应

872
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,254
which is a type UITapGestureRecognizer.
这是一种UITapGestureRecognizer。

873
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:53,356
And here I'm just gonna say,
这里我要说，

874
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,625
if the tapRecognizer.state is ended.

875
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,194
So the tap happened.
所以发生了水龙头。

876
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:03,066
Then I'm gonna let eyes, which is FacialExpression.Eyes,
然后我会让眼睛，这是面部表情，眼睛，

877
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:06,135
just so that you know what type that is,
这样你就知道那是什么类型了，

878
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:10,206
equal whatever my current expression's eyes are,
不管我现在的表情是什么，

879
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:14,810
if the current expressions eyes are closed, then I'm

880
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:19,448
going to have them be open, otherwise they will be closed.

00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,251
So I'm just toggling them.

882
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:27,323
So eyes now which is of type FacialExpression.Eyes,

883
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,592
it's got the opposite or whatever the old one had.

891
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,380
that's gonna cause this didSet to happen.

00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,489
That's gonna handle that.
的处理。

896
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,825
So now we have to add a tap gesture recognizer
现在我们需要添加一个tap手势识别器

897
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:03,692
to our face view.
我们的脸。

898
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:08,064
So this time let's just say let tapRecognizer =
所以这次我们说，让tap识别器=

899
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,600
UITapGestureRecognizer.
UITapGestureRecognizer。

900
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,703
And as always we just specify target and selector.
和往常一样，我们只指定目标和选择器。

901
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,838
So the target this time is not faceView,

902
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,139
up here it was faceView.
在上面，它是faceView。

903
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,542
Now the target is myself.

904
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,644
And the action is going to be,
这个动作是，

905
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,547
again I can say faceView controller or
我还是可以用faceView控制器

906
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,751
I can indicate self dot, we'll do that, toggle eyes.
我可以画出self。。

907
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,825
And we need to put around this #selector.

908
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:41,397
Cuz we need to turn it into that particular selector.
因为我们需要把它转换成特定的选择器。

909
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,966
Then again, I don't actually need that self in there,
再一次，我实际上不需要那个self，

910
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,885
Looks a little better cuz it defaults to my own methods.
看起来好一点，因为它默认了我自己的方法。

911
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:47,737
I can just do that.
我可以这么做。

912
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,040
So we got the tap recognizer created.
所以我们创建了tap识别器。

913
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,610
Now we have to configure the tap recognizer
现在我们需要配置tap识别器

914
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,011
because we want it to happen on single taps.
因为我们想让它发生在单个熄灯号上。

915
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,148
So we could say for example numberOfTapsRequired = 1,
所以我们可以说，例如numberOfTapsRequired = 1，

916
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,618
that happens to be the default, so probably I won't
这恰好是默认值，所以我可能不会

917
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,786
need to actually say that, but we'll do it anyway.

919
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,625
a gestureRecognizer to the FaceView.
一个gestureRecognizer到FaceView。

920
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,662
If you don't do this step of adding it to some view
如果你不这样做的话，把它添加到某个视图中

921
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,498
then that view is not going to be recognizing this.

922
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,500
So it's not gonna be doing anything.

923
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,836
Just an easy step to kind of forget.

924
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:26,008

925
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:30,612
see if that works.

928
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,856
And it's changing it in the model.

00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,761
that causes the update UI to happen, this update UI does

950
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,349
And these vars here, happier and

957
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,132
it's using this raw value mechanism in enum, hopefully

like this ByReactingTo guy down here.
就像这里的人一样。

965
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,786
Because a swipe gesture is discrete, so

966
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,456
we never have to look at the swipe gesture when it happens,

we know it happened and that's all we need to know.

969
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,297
anything like that, like a tap gesture or a swipe gesture or

975
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:53,522
And I'm gonna have this be the selector increaseHappiness

981
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,772
And since swipeDown is so similar,

982
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,176

the logic going into detecting was that a swipe, or was that
用于检测的逻辑是滑动，或者是

1004
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,969
a pan, or what was that, was all done for you by iOS.
一个平移，或者是什么，都是由iOS完成的。

1005
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:21,243
Back to our
回到我们的

1006
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:26,716
slides.
幻灯片。

1007
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,618
Time to talk about building bigger apps,
是时候讨论构建更大的应用了，

1008
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:33,622
apps where we're gonna have multiple MVCs involved.
我们将有多个mvc的应用程序。

1009
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,391
Not just our calculator MVC, but multiple MVCs.
不只是我们的计算器MVC，而是多个MVC。

1010
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,528
Not just our face view controller MVC, but
不只是我们的face view controller MVC，而是

1011
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,230
multiple MVCs.
多个mvc。

1012
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,735
So I showed you this picture from the MVC discussion and
我给你们看了这张MVC讨论的图片

1013
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,937
you can see that the MVCs relationship to each other is
可以看到，mvc之间的关系是

1014
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:54,209
that one or more MVCs is part of the view of another MVC.
一个或多个MVC是另一个MVC视图的一部分。

1015
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,713
So let's see how that happens.
我们来看看这是怎么发生的。

1016
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:03,085
We combine these MVCs using, (I don't wanna say special,
我们把这些mvc结合起来(我不想说特别，

1017
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,188
because you could write your own), but
因为你可以自己写，但是

1018
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:09,391
built-in MVCs that come with iOS.
内置的mvc，与iOS兼容。

1019
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,027
And these MVCs are built
这些mvc构建

1020
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,796
using other MVCs as part of their view.
使用其他mvc作为视图的一部分。

1021
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,533
So, yes you can build your own.
所以，你可以建立你自己的。

1022
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,535
So, for example, here's the three that we do most of our
举个例子，这是我们做的三件事

1023
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,704
building with here or pretty much all of our building,
在这里或几乎所有的建筑中，

1024
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,706
multiple MVCs.
多个mvc。

1025
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,708
There's the TabBarController, a SplitViewController and
这是TabBarController,SplitViewController

1026
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:27,977
a NavigationController.
一个导航控制器。

1027
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,879
So I'm gonna go into detail here about how each of these
这里我将详细讲解每一个

1028
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,282
controllers, are controllers of MVCs
控制器，是mvc的控制器

1029
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,886
whose view is other MVCs.
谁的观点是其他的mvc。

1030
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,089
So here's a TabBarController for example.
这是一个TabBarController。

1031
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,158
If you look at what you see up there,
如果你看你在上面看到的，

1032
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:47,195
there are two MVCs on that screen, two.
屏幕上有两个mvc。

1033
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,732
One MVC is the TabBarController.
一个MVC是TabBarController。

1034
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,334
It's what's drawing the little icons at the bottom.
这是底部的小图标。

1035
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,103
You see those icons at the bottom, those four icons?
你看到那些图标在底部，那四个图标?

1036
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,972
That MVC is doing that.
MVC就是这么做的。

1037
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,642
The other MVC is the thing surrounded in yellow,
另一个MVC是用黄色包围的，

1038
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,011
a dashboard MVC, whatever that is,
一个仪表板MVC，不管它是什么，

1039
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,213
something in the health app here or something.
在健康应用程序中。

1040
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,249
That is drawn by a completely different MVC,
这是由一个完全不同的MVC绘制的，

1041
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,684
the dashboard MVC.
仪表板MVC。

1042
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,087
But notice how it's drawing inside the view
但注意它是如何在视图中绘制的

1043
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,889
of the tab bar controller.
的标签栏控制器。

1044
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,526
So, you're already seeing here how we're building an MVC out
你已经看到了我们如何构建一个MVC

1045
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,461
of other MVCs.
其他的mvc。

1046
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,498
The tab bar controller has an MVC built into its view.
标签栏控制器有一个MVC内置的视图。

1047
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,568
Now, what's interesting is this is very object oriented
有趣的是，这是面向对象的

1048
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,872
in that those buttons along the bottom, both the icon and
在底部的那些按钮，图标和

1049
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,807
the text on and if they had a badge,
文本，如果他们有徽章，

1050
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:32,875
that would be there too.
那也会在那里。

1051
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:37,179
Those are actually not being set in the TabBarController,
这些实际上不是在TabBarController中设置的，

1052
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,082
the TabBarController is grabbing them from
TabBarController正在抓取它们

1053
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,050
the dashboard MVC.
仪表板MVC。

1054
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,988
Grabs them from a var in the dashboard MVC,
从在仪表板MVC中的var中获取它们，

1055
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,724
it's a view UI controller bar called TabBarItem.
它是一个名为TabBarItem的视图UI控制器条。

1056
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,263
And TabBarItem has things like Badges, and titles, and icons,
TabBarItem有徽章，标题和图标，

1057
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,465
things like that.
类似这样的事情。

1058
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,001
And of course, we can have more MVCs in the tab bar if I
当然，如果我，我们可以在标签栏中有更多的mvc

1059
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,271
click on that second icon right there,
点击第二个图标，

1060
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,340
I get a different MVC filling up this space at the top.
我得到了一个不同的MVC填充这个空间的顶部。

1061
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,843
So now, we've seen three MVCs so
现在，我们已经看到了3个mvc

1062
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,646
far, dashboard, health data, and the TabBarController.
远、仪表板、健康数据和TabBarController。

1063
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,984
Right, now by the way, if you get too many tabs, if you put
对了，如果你有太多的标签

1064
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,187
six MVCs, for example, into a tab bar controller,
例如，6个mvc，到一个标签栏控制器，

1065
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,924
then you get a little more "..." icon on the right, and
然后你再多一点……右边的图标，还有

1066
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,593
you can click that and the user can get at those.
你可以点击它，用户可以得到这些。

1067
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:29,164
So a tab bar controller could have more than five MVCs.
所以标签栏控制器可以有5个以上的mvc。

1068
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,966
But if you start getting more than five,
但如果你开始得到5个以上，

1069
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,502
the UI gets a little clunky because their user is having
用户界面因为用户的存在而变得有点笨拙

1070
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,571
to go over and click that more to get to the other one.
为了走到另一个地方，点击它。

1071
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I kinda recommend if you have a tab bar,
我建议如果你有一个标签栏，

1072
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,808
don't put more than five MVCs in there.
不要放多于5个mvc。

1073
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,812
So the question is, when we have the icons at the bottom
问题是，当我们有底部的图标时

1074
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,381
and like, the icons and the titles there.
比如，图标和标题。

1075
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,651
And I said that it's getting that from the MVCs that
我说这是从mvc那里得到的

1076
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,951
are being shown.
被显示。

1077
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:56,058
The question is, is the embedded
问题是，嵌入式的

1078
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,027
MVC, like the health data one, or the dashboard one, is it
MVC，像health data one，或dashboard one，就是它

1079
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,032
getting the button and the title there from the model?
从模型中获取按钮和标题?

1080
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,433
And the answer is, that's up to that MVC.
答案是，这取决于MVC。

1081
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,304
Some MVCs might well do that, probably most are not because
一些风险投资公司很可能做到这一点，可能大多数不是因为

1082
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,808
it's kinda more of a UI thing what the icon and the text is.
它更像是一个UI，图标和文本。

1083
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,744
Probably not part of the model, especially the icon.
可能不是模型的一部分，尤其是图标。

1084
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:23,151
Unlikely to be in the model.
不太可能出现在模型中。

1085
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,356
We have more MVCs for a total of five MVCs on the screen.
我们有更多的mvc，在屏幕上总共有5个mvc。

1086
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,691
The tab bar controller and
标签栏控制器和

1087
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,828
these four MVCs that are each of the tabs.
这四个mvc是每个选项卡。

1088
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:37,532
So this is the simplest way to combine MVCs.
这是组合mvc最简单的方法。

1089
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,335
But do you see what I mean when I say that these other
但你明白我说的这些是什么意思吗

1090
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:44,139
MVCs are part of the view of the tab bar controller.
MVCs是标签栏控制器视图的一部分。

1091
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,743
They're actually even their views are embedded physically
实际上，他们的观点也被植入了身体

1092
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:52,915
embedded inside the tab bar controller's view.
嵌入在标签栏控制器的视图中。

1093
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:54,716
So that's the simplest one.
这是最简单的。

1094
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,552
Let's talk about the next simplest one,
我们来讨论下一个最简单的，

1095
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,153
which is split view controller.
这是分屏视图控制器。

1096
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:03,025
So split view controllers is two MVCs side by side.
分屏视图控制器是两个mvc。

1097
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,694
You get to see them both on screen at the same time,
你可以同时在屏幕上看到它们，

1098
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,262
at least in landscape you do.
至少在风景中是这样的。

1099
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,866
This one on the left here is a calculator MVC.
左边的这个是计算器MVC。

1100
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,735
It doesn't look much like yours but
它看起来不像你的，但是

1101
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,037
you can imagine that's a calculator MVC.
你可以想象这是一个计算器MVC。

1102
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:15,837
That MVC,
MVC,

1103
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,409
we call the master MVC of the split view controller.
我们调用了分屏视图控制器的主MVC。

1104
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,044
And then on the other side there's a whole different MVC,
然后在另一边有一个完全不同的MVC，

1105
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,713
completely and utterly different.
完全不同。

1106
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:29,251
This one happens to be a graph of
这个恰好是一个图

1107
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,486
what's in the calculator MVC.
计算器MVC里有什么。

1108
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,888
And this is gonna look very similar
这看起来非常相似

1109
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,724
to your homework assignment, because that is assignment 3.
作业中，因为这是作业3。

1110
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,493
To build a graphing calculator,
要建立一个图形计算器，

1111
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,894
you're gonna be putting in a split view and
你将会有一个分屏视图

1112
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,662
doing all the things I'm talking about today,
我今天所讲的一切，

1113
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,030
so pay attention.
引起我们的注意。

1114
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,098
So that we call a detail.
我们称之为细节。

1115
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,699
The reason we call that a detail,
我们称之为细节的原因，

1116
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,568
is almost always the right side,
几乎总是正确的，

1117
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:51,740
which is larger usually, whatever's in it happens
通常情况下，会发生什么

1118
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,143
to be controlled by what's on the left by the master.
由主人左边的东西控制。

1119
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,677
And that would be true here.
在这里也是成立的。

1120
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:58,313
Cuz the graph on the right is showing whatever is in
因为右边的图显示的是

1121
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,280
the calculator on the left.
左边的计算器。

1122
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,216
So if you change something in the calculator on the left and
如果你在计算器左边改变一些东西

1123
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,719
hit its graphing button, it changes the details.
点击它的绘图按钮，它会改变细节。

1124
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:08,123
So the master is controlling the detail in that way.
所以大师就是这样控制细节的。

1125
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,693
Now, and this is what it looks like when these things
这就是这些东西的样子

1126
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,461
are side-by-side in landscape mode.
景观模式是并排的。

1127
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,630
But what if you switch over to portrait?
但如果你切换到竖屏呢?

1128
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,632
Well, in portrait it just shows you the detail, but
在竖屏中，它只是展示了细节，但是

1129
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:22,204
you can swipe from the left and get the master to come
你可以从左边滑动，让主人来

1130
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,773
out on top of it and then do whatever you want.
在上面，然后做任何你想做的事情。

1131
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,074
It still updates the utility and
它仍然更新实用程序和

1132
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,476
you can swipe it out of the way.
你可以把它从路上划掉。

1133
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,212
So that's split view controller.
这是分屏视图控制器。

1134
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,348
Super simple.
超级简单。

1135
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,717
Again, hopefully you're seeing that there are three MVCs
希望你能看到有三个mvc

1136
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,886
The split view controller's MVC, and these master and
拆分视图控制器的MVC，以及这些master和

1137
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,987
up here.
在这里。

1138
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,089
detail MVCs.
细节mvc。

1139
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,459
The master details serve as the view of
大师的细节是可以理解的

1140
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,427
that split view controller.
分屏视图控制器。

1141
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,764
Notice that the split view controller itself has no UI.
注意，拆分视图控制器本身没有UI。

1142
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,432
It doesn't actually draw anything in the view,
它并没有在视图中绘制任何东西，

1143
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,103
it just uses the UI or the view of these MVCs to draw.
它只是使用UI或者这些mvc的视图来绘制。

1144
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,873
I guess, it draws the vertical line between the two,

00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,843
Not back, but every time you go forward to a new card,
不是回来，但每次你向前进一张新卡，

1289
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,278
it always creates a new one.
它总是创建一个新的。

1290
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,613
That's something I'm gonna say three or
这是我要说的三种

1291
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,614
four times in this slide so
这张幻灯片上有四次

1292
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,715
as to make sure you understand it.
为了确保你能理解它。

1293
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:18,686
This activity of going to a new one is called segueing.
这种去新的活动叫做segue。

1294
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:23,891
This particular segue's called a show or a push segue.
这个segue叫做show或push segue。

1295
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,561
Which just means a segue in a navigation control with
这意味着导航控件中的一个segue

1296
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,463
the stack of cards.
堆栈的卡片。

1297
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,199
Now when you do that, you get the back button for
当你这样做的时候，你就得到了back按钮

1298
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,134
free, it just automatically appears up there because
自由，它会自动出现在那里

1299
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,036
that top bar like I say is
就像我说的那样

1300
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,740
drawn by the navigation controller's part of its view.
由导航控制器的部分视图绘制。

1301
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,409
And when you click that back button,
当你点击那个后退按钮，

1302
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,745
of course what happens is interesting here.
当然，这里发生的事情很有趣。

1303
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:47,883
Of course this slides back, but what happened to that MVC?
当然，这些幻灯片会回来，但是MVC发生了什么?

1304
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,717
Gone.
一去不复返了。

1305
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,054
Deallocated from the heap.
从堆中分配。

1306
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,023
So when you go back,
所以当你回去的时候，

1307
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:58,526
whatever card was on top gets thrown away.
上面的牌都被扔了。

1308
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,696
So MVCs, as you're kind of getting the picture here,
所以mvc，正如你在这里看到的，

1309
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,464
they're pretty ephemeral.
他们是非常短暂的。

1310
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,901
MVCs don't really stick around for a long time.
mvc在很长一段时间内都不会真正坚持下去。

1311
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,502
Now the root card on a Navigation Controller,
现在，导航控制器上的根卡，

1312
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,704
it's gonna stick around pretty long,
它会粘在一起很长，

1313
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,439
as long as that Navigation Controller is on screen.
只要那个导航控制器在屏幕上。

1314
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:14,108
But mostly MVCs kind of come and go.
但大部分的mvc都是来来去去的。

1315
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,445
And it's their models that tend to be persistent.
他们的模型往往是持久的。

1316
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,379
When you create a new MVC,
当你创建一个新的MVC时，

1317
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,715
you usually hook it up to a database or a network or
你通常把它连接到数据库或网络上

1318
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,184
something, something persistent.
一些东西,一些有持久的东西。

1319
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,452
And so that's why it's showing something new.
这就是为什么它展示了一些新的东西。

1320
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:27,189
Or it's an MVC that showed something new every time.
或者它是一个每次都显示新事物的MVC。

1321
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,627
So that's how a navigation controller works.
这就是导航控制器的工作原理。

1322
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,397
I'm gonna talk a little bit how we hook all of this up.
我要稍微讲一下我们是怎么把这些联系起来的。

1323
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,333
Because of course we're gonna do all this hooking up with
因为我们当然要勾搭上

1324
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,104
control drag in Xcode, that's how we hook everything up.
control拖动到Xcode中，这就是我们把所有东西都连接起来的方式。

1325
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:43,938
But I wanna talk a little bit about the code
但我想谈谈代码

1326
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:44,806
behind so you know.
所以你知道后面。

1327
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,310
There's an important var that is in these viewControllers,
在这些视图控制器中有一个重要的var，

1328
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:49,277
like tab bar controller, and
和标签栏控制器一样

1329
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,912
navigation controller, and split view controller.
导航控制器和分屏视图控制器。

1330
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,547
It's called viewControllers, and
它被称为viewcontroller

1331
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:56,017
it's an optional array of UIViewControllers.
这是一个可选的UIViewControllers数组。

1332
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,318
And it means different things depending on
这取决于不同的东西

1333
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:02,457
which one you're in.
哪一个你。

1334
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,194
each tab, with the left most tab's MVC's at 0 and then 1,
每个标签，左边大部分的MVC在0，然后1，

1335
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,632
2, 3, 4 is just the rest of the MVCs.

1336
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:14,001
For a split view 0 is always the master, 1 is always
对于分屏视图0始终是主，1总是

1337
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,905
the detail, and there's never any other ones in this array.
细节，在这个数组中没有其他的。

1338
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:21,743
For a navigation control, 0 is the base card, and 1, 2, 3,
对于导航控件，0是底牌，1 2 3，

1339
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:25,513
4, etc., are the ones stacked on top, in order.

1340
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,315
So that's how you can kinda get at them.
这就是你如何去了解他们的方法。

1341
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:32,520
Now, we don't usually, this is a bar, it can be set but
现在，我们通常不会，这是一个酒吧，它可以设置，但是

1342
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:35,623
we usually don't set this bar, we don't set the things,
我们通常不设置这个栏，我们不设置这些，

1343
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,993
we either use things that we do in our UI, which I'll show
我们可以在UI中使用它，我将展示它

1344
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,629
you or even like in Navigation Controller, there's push and
你甚至喜欢导航控制器，有push和

1345
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,934
pop methods to push MVCs on and pop them off of the stack.
使用pop方法将MVCs推到堆栈上并将其弹出。

1346
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,272
Now, it's great to have this var ViewControllers, but
现在，有了这个var视图控制器很好，但是

1347
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,642
how do you get the Split View Controller or
如何得到分屏视图控制器

1348
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,477
get the Tab Bar Controller if you're in one?
如果你在一个标签栏控制器?

1349
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,380
Okay if I'm the all settings MVC or
如果我是所有的设置MVC

1350
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:04,052
I'm one of the health data ones that we saw on the tab
我是我们在标签上看到的健康数据之一

1351
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,687
bar, how do I get the navigation controller I'm in,
bar，我怎么得到我所在的导航控制器，

1352
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,823
or the split view I'm in or the tab bar I'm in?
或者是我所在的分屏视图?

1353
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,826
Well all UIViewControllers have these three vars,
所有的UIViewControllers都有这三个vars，

1354
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,461
tab bar controller, split view controller and
标签栏控制器，分屏视图控制器

1355
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,528
navigation controller.
导航控制器。

1356
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,231
And if you are in one of those things this will return
如果你在其中一件事上，这将会回来

1357
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,867
the one you are in.

01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,702
And if you're not in one, it will return nil.
如果你不在一个，它会返回nil。

1359
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:22,604
So that's how you find out
这就是你的发现

1360
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:24,039
the Split View Controller you're in.
你在的分屏视图控制器。

1361
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,941
And you can use the combination of
你可以结合使用

1362
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,141
For example, if you're the Master in a Split View,
例如，如果你是分屏视图的主人，

1363
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,274
these two things.
这两个东西。

1364
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,513
you can find your detail MVC by saying
你可以通过说，找到你的详细MVC

1365
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:33,415
what's the split view controller I'm in?
我在的分视图控制器是什么?

1366
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,017
Get its View Controllers, look at View Controller sub 1
获取它的视图控制器，查看视图控制器sub 1

1367
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,653
because that's always the detail.
因为那总是细节。

1368
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:39,521
So I just clicked and went up and over and got it.
所以我只是点击了一下，然后往上走，然后得到了它。

1369
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,322
You see?
你看到了什么?

1370
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,058
And I use the question mark, the optional chaining there
我用问号，这个可选的链接

1371
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,992
because I might not be in a split view controller.
因为我可能不在分屏视图控制器中。

1372
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,694
And then it obviously will return nil for
然后它显然会返回nil

1373
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,864
my detail, which is fine cuz it would be nil if I'm not in
我的细节，很好因为如果我不在，它将是零

1374
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,666
a split view controller obviously there's no detail.
分屏视图控制器显然没有细节。

1375
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,904
Now, how do we wire all this stuff up?
现在，我们怎么把这些东西连接起来呢?

1376
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,439
Of course we're gonna do it all graphically.
当然我们要用图形来表示。

1377
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,775
Let's start by at looking at the split view and
让我们从拆分视图开始

1378
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,510
how we do this.
我们该怎么做。

1379
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,279
Now to create a new view controller, whether it's one
现在创建一个新的视图控制器，不管它是1

1380
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,215
of these view controllers of view controllers that we
这些视图控制器的视图控制器

1381
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,517
were talking about or just a regular view controller.
或者只是一个常规的视图控制器。

1382
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:12,186
You go down to the object pallet and you drag it out
向下到对象托盘，然后拖出来

1383
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:15,456
into your storyboard just like a button, except you're just
进入你的故事板，就像一个按钮，只是你只是

1384
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,825
dragging to open space and it's created there.
拖动到开放空间，它在那里创建。

1385
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,562
Now when you drag a split view controller out, it's
现在当你拖拽一个分屏视图控制器时，它是

1386
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,666
actually gonna drag out kind of empty, detail and master.
实际上会拖出一个空的，细节的和主人的。

1387
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:26,467
You never want that.
你永远不希望这样。

1388
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,236
I don't know why it really does that.
我不知道为什么会这样。

1389
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,737
Just delete those.
仅仅删除这些。

1390
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,839
You're obviously gonna have your MVC's like your

1391
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,208
calculator and your graphing view controller sitting in
计算器和你的绘图视图控制器

1392
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,410
your storyboard and you're gonna drag the split view
你的故事板会拖拽分屏视图

1393
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,779
controller and you're gonna wire it up to those.
控制器，你要把它连接起来。

1394
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,083
So you're gonna delete any of the extra junk that comes out.
所以你要删除掉出来的多余的垃圾。

1395
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,319
Then you just Ctrl+drag like we do,
然后按Ctrl +拖动，

1396
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,422
our favorite gesture in a face builder, is Ctrl+drag.
我们在face builder中最喜欢的手势是Ctrl +拖动。

1397
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,992
We just Ctrl+drag from the split view controller
我们按Ctrl +拖动从分屏视图控制器

1398
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,194
to the master and to the detail, so I'll get up.
对于大师和细节，我将站起来。

1399
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,263
So this is what that looks like.
这就是它的样子。

1400
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,432
Here I've got split view controller on the left.
左边是分屏视图控制器。

1401
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,767
I've got calculator view control on the top and

1404
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,972
drag from the split view controllers,
从分屏视图控制器中拖拽，

1405
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,174
the calculator controller.
计算器控制器。

1406
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,510
This little black window is gonna come up.
这个小黑窗将会出现。

1407
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,914
I'm gonna choose master view controller from the list and
我将从列表中选择master视图控制器

1408
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:16,951
that's gonna hook that one up top to my master.
这将把它和我的主人联系起来。

1409
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,155
Then, I'm gonna Ctrl+drag to the bottom one, the black

1410
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,924
window comes up I'm gonna choose Detail View Controller
窗口出现，我会选择Detail视图控制器

1411
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,659
then it's gonna make that connection.
然后它会连接。

1412
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,361
Okay, as simple as that.
就这么简单。

1413
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,363
Now you've got the split view with master that's
现在你已经有了主的分屏视图

1414
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,566
calculator of your controller and
你的控制器的计算器

1415
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,169
detail that is going to be a graphic view controller.
这将是一个图形视图控制器。

1416
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,205
Now, one interesting thing here though,
现在，有一件有趣的事，

1417
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,774
is this split view does not work on an iPhone.
这种拆分视图在iPhone上不起作用。

1418
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:43,344
Well it works on iPhone plus, iPhone six plus or
它适用于iPhone +，iPhone 6 plus

1419
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,013
seven plus, the kind of big ones, but it does not work on
7 plus，大的，但它没有作用

1420
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,783
a normal iPhone, it's just not enough screen real estate to
一个普通的iPhone，只是没有足够的屏幕空间

1421
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:52,053
really do the split view thing, so we can't do it.
做分屏视图，我们不能这么做。

1422
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,989
So, what we really want to do is build a UI though that
所以，我们真正想做的是建立一个UI

1423
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,191
works on all the devices.
在所有的设备上工作。

1424
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,827
So to do that, what we do is we're gonna wrap
要做到这一点，我们要做的就是包装

1425
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,763
the master and the detail if we want.
如果我们想要的话，master和detail。

1426
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,466
We're gonna wrap them in a navigation controller.
我们要把它们包在导航控制器里。

1427
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,901
And then when they're on iPhone,
当他们在iPhone上的时候，

1428
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,102
they won't use the split view part,
他们不会使用分屏视图，

1429
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,838
they'll just use the navigation controller.
他们会使用导航控制器。

1430
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,808
It's really cool, how it figures this out.
它很酷，它是怎么计算出来的。

1431
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:17,178
The way to wrap a view controller that's in there,
包装一个视图控制器的方法，

1432
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,047
you wanna wrap it in a Navigation Controller,
你想把它包裹在导航控制器里，

1433
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,282
you just go to the Editor menu,
你只要去编辑器菜单，

1434
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,116
the same place we did embed and stack view,
我们做嵌入和堆栈视图的地方，

1435
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,151
and some of that.
和一些。

1436
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,887
And you select the whole scene of your MVC, and
然后选择MVC的整个场景

1437
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,623
you go to the Editor Menu and
你去编辑菜单

1438
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,993
you say embed in navigation controller.
你说嵌入导航控制器。

1439
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:34,295
So I've selected that top, calculate and control and
所以我选择了顶部，计算和控制

1440
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,563
when I do that,
当我这样做,

1441
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,199
it's going to put it inside a navigation controller.
它会把它放到导航控制器中。

1442
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,067
Did you see that?
你看到了吗?

1443
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,236
Now, I've got the flip view, it points to a navigation
现在，我有了flip视图，它指向一个导航

1444
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,372
controller, so the master of this flip view is actually
控制器，所以这个视图的主人实际上

1445
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,808
that navigation controller, and then the navigation
导航控制器，然后是导航

1446
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,311
controller root view controller is the calculator.
控制器根视图控制器是计算器。

1447
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,146
So, if you're on a device that can do split view,
如果你在一个可以分屏视图的设备上，

1448
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:53,114
like an iPad or a plus,
比如iPad或plus，

1449
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,316
you're going to get the whole split view effect.
你会得到整个拆分视图效果。

1450
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,684
But if you're on just an iPhone,
但如果你只使用iPhone，

1451
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:58,486
it's not going to do the split view.
它不会执行分屏视图。

1452
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,721
It's just going to do the navigation controller.
它会做导航控制器。

1453
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,989
So, when you look at the detail,
所以，当你看细节的时候，

1454
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,192
it's going to slide it in.
它会把它放进去。

1455
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:06,761
Whereas if you're on a iPad in landscape,
而如果你在iPad上，

1456
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,764
you're gonna see Master and Detail at the same time.
你会同时看到Master和Detail。

1457
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:13,568
Now, you can also do the same thing- yeah, and so
现在，你也可以做同样的事情——是的，所以

1458
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,703
the UINavigationController is the Master,
UINavigationController是Master，

1459
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,639
as, as I talked about.
就像我说的。

1460
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,074
So you can do the same thing with the Detail.
你可以对细节做同样的事情。

1461
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,410
Now why would you ever do that with the Detail?
你为什么要这样做呢?

1462
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,111
Because yo've already done it with the master and
因为你已经和大师做过了

1463
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,513
so you gotta click in the master to get to the detail,
所以你要点击master来得到细节，

1464
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,516
so yo're kinda already gonna be in a navigation controller,
所以你已经在导航控制器中了，

1465
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:29,584
and tha's true.
,那是事实。

1466
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:32,186
But wha's kinda nice about putting the detail
但wha对细节的描述很好

1467
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:35,223
in a navigation controller is you get that little title bar,
在导航控制器中，你得到那个小标题栏，

1468
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,524
you know the little gray title bar?
你知道那个灰色的小标题吧?

1469
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,391
So now, your master and
现在，你的主人和

1470
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,561
your detail both have a title bar on the top and
你的细节都有标题栏在上面

1471
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:40,961
they match up nicely.
他们很好地匹配。

1472
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,930
So if you wanna title on your detail,
如果你想要详细说明，

1473
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:43,598
that's a good thing to do.
这是件好事。

1474
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,566
The only thing to be careful there though is
唯一要注意的是

1475
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,269
now your detail in not a graph view controller.
现在你的细节不是图形视图控制器。

1476
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,638
Your detail is now a navigation controller.
你的detail现在是一个导航控制器。

1477
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,540
So if you wanna get the graph view controller and
如果你想要得到图形视图控制器

1478
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,342
like talk to it, tell it what to graph or
就像跟它说话一样，告诉它要画什么

1479
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,911
something like that, you need to get the root view
像这样，你需要得到根视图

1480
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,580
controller of the navigation controller.
导航控制器的控制器。

1481
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,549
So it's just subtle difference but
所以这只是细微的差别

1482
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,685
if you wrap your detail in a navigation controller,
如果你把你的细节包装在导航控制器中，

1483
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,853
the detail has come become a navigation controller.
细节已经成为导航控制器。

1484
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,588
It's easy to get to the graph view controller,
很容易得到图形视图控制器，

1485
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,724
cuz the root view controller of the navigation controller.
cuz导航控制器的根视图控制器。

1486
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:15,096
That's how you wire up the split views so
这就是分割视图的方式

1487
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:17,298
that it works cross platform, all devices.
它可以跨平台，所有设备。

1488
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:21,302
The last thing we're gonna talk about is segueing.
最后我们要讲的是segue。

1489
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,406
So we know how to wire up the split view controller, and
我们知道如何将分屏视图控制器连接起来

1490
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,974
we know how to do a navigation control,
我们知道怎么做导航控制，

1491
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,376
we just embed it in the navigation controller.
我们将它嵌入到导航控制器中。

1492
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,346
I didn't talk about the tab bar controller by the way,
我之前没有讲过标签栏控制器，

1493
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,446
but that's easy.
但这很简单。

1494
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,450
You just drag a tab bar controller out and CTRL + drag
你只需拖动标签栏控制器并按CTRL +拖动

1495
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,152
to all of the MVC's that you want it to show,
对于所有的MVC来说，

1496
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:42,223
and you can actually even drag the little icons around
你甚至可以拖动小图标

1497
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,724
to put them in order.
把它们按顺序排列。

1498
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,227
You can even set the icons in text in the interface builder
您甚至可以在接口构建器中设置文本中的图标

1499
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:46,961
with an inspector.
检查员。

1500
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,797
So, tab bars, so simple I don't even want to waste time
所以，标签栏，很简单，我甚至不想浪费时间

1501
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,633
showing it, but so we know how to kind of hook up and control
展示它，但我们知道如何建立和控制

1502
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:56,971
drags and wire up, or embed to do the navigation controllers.
拖动和连接，或嵌入到导航控制器。

1503
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,540
How do we go from one to the other, like in the navigation
我们如何从一个到另一个，就像在导航中一样

1504
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:02,109
controller, how do we go from all settings to settings and
控制器，我们怎么从所有的设置到设置和

1505
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,244
from settings to accessibility,
从设置可访问性,

1506
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:07,081
and accessibility to larger text?
更大的文本的可访问性?

1507
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,651
How do we set up that transition or how do we make
我们如何建立这种转变呢

1508
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,354
it so that we press a button in our calculator split view
因此，我们在计算器拆分视图中按下一个按钮

1509
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,557
and it causes that graph to be replaced with a new graph?
它会导致图像被新的图形取代吗?

1510
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,157
How do we do that?
怎么做呢?

1511
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,226
We do that with what are called segues.
我们用segue来做这个。

1512
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,628
I've alluded to this earlier.
我之前提到过。

1513
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,832
These are the kinds of segues that exist.
这些是存在的segue。

1514
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,066
There's a show segue.
有一个显示segue。

1515
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,436
That means, if you're in a Navigation Controller,
这意味着，如果你在导航控制器中，

1516
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,537
slide a card on.
幻灯片一张卡片。

1517
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,740
There's Show Detail,
有显示的细节,

1518
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,208
which if you're a Navigation Controller,
如果你是导航控制器，

1519
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,044
still means slide a card on.
仍然意味着一张卡片。

1520
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,578
But if you're inside a Split View,
但如果你在分屏视图里，

1521
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,982
it means put this new MVC where the detail goes.
它的意思是把这个新的MVC放在一个细节上。

1522
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:42,683
That's why it's called Show Detail.
这就是为什么它被称为显示细节。

1523
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,552
So Show Detail behaves differently depending on
因此，显示细节的行为取决于不同

1524
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,653
whether you're in the Split View or
不管你是在分屏视图还是

1525
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:48,122
whether you're in a Navigation Controller.
不管你是在导航控制器里。

1526
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,591
Modal segue, it's kind of interesting one.
Modal segue，很有趣。

1527
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,227
It takes over the entire screen and lets
它占据了整个屏幕

1528
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:57,831
the MVC that you're segueing into own the whole screen.
你segue到的MVC拥有整个屏幕。

1529
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,034
Now, these can be somewhat disturbing to the users cuz,
这些可能会让用户感到不安，

1530
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,869
I can't get back to where I was,
我无法回到原来的位置，

1531
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,804
cuz there's no back button or anything.
因为没有后退按钮什么的。

1532
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,239
That whatever MVC comes up and
不管MVC是什么

1533
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,775
takes over the screen has to provide some UI to get out of
接管屏幕必须提供一些UI来摆脱

1534
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,945
there like cancel or done, or something.
好像取消了，或者做了什么。

1535
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,915
So we try to stay away from Modal if we can.
所以如果可以的话，我们尽量远离模态。

1536
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,019
So Popover is sort of the same as Modal, but
弹窗和模态是一样的

1537
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,621
instead of taking over the whole screen, it just puts up
而不是接管整个屏幕，它只是简单地说

1538
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,656
a little pop-up window, a little popover window,
一个弹出窗口，一个弹出窗口，

1539
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,958
you've seen that, on iPad especially.
你已经看到了，尤其是在iPad上。

1540
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:28,229
It's still Modal, because if you click anywhere else,
它仍然是模态的，因为如果你点击其他地方，

1541
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,797
the popover goes away.
弹出窗口消失。

1542
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,233
So it's essentially modal.
这是基本模态。

1543
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:33,634
It's a little nicer than modal, though,
它比模态的好一点，

1544
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,737
because you can really see the background kinda grayed out.
因为你可以看到背景变灰了。

1545
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,772
And if you don't want what's in the popover,
如果你不想要弹出窗口，

1546
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,541
just click somewhere else and it goes away.
只要点击其他地方，它就消失了。

1547
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,076
So yeah, popover's a little nicer than modal.
弹窗比模态更漂亮一点。

1548
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,078
But it only works on fairly large screens,
但它只在大屏幕上运行，

1549
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,247
unless you have a really small pop over window.
除非你有一个非常小的弹出窗口。

1550
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,319
Now, I'm going to emphasize for
现在，我要强调一下

1551
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,421
the second time what I said before segues always create
第二次是我在segue之前说的

1552
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,824
a new instance of the MVC.
MVC的一个新实例。

1553
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:00,695
All of the segues, all of them, modal, popover, show,
所有的segues，都是，modal,popover,show，

1554
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:01,495
slide in the min,
下滑的最小值,

1555
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,265
show detail, even show detail in the split view.
显示细节，甚至在拆分视图中显示细节。

1556
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,635
If you have a calculator and you say graph my function and
如果你有一个计算器，你可以把它写出来

1557
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,470
you segue to a graph view controller,
你segue到一个图形视图控制器，

1558
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,372
it throws away the one that was there and
它扔掉了那个在那里的

1559
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:14,908
puts a new one there, always creating new MVCs.
在那里放一个新的，总是创建新的mvc。

1560
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:18,379
So think of these MVCs as ephemeral, they come alive,
因此，把这些mvc看作是短暂的，它们会活过来，

1561
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,280
they do their job and they go away.
他们做自己的工作，然后离开。

1562
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,784
They don't live you know, long lives.
他们不活在你的生命里。

1563
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,686
Now the master and a split view.
现在，主和分屏视图。

1564
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,121
The root view of a navigational,
导航的根视图，

1565
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,823
they tend to live fairly long.
他们往往活得很长。

1566
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,526
But even those, if that split view, if that navigational
但即使是那些，如果那是分裂的观点，如果这是导航的话

1567
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,428
were to go off screen, they go away as well.
如果要离开屏幕，他们也会离开。

1568
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,398
So how do we make these segues happen?
那么我们如何让这些segue发生呢?

1569
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,233
Of course, we use control drag.
当然，我们使用control拖动。

1570
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,569
We love to use control drag, so here for
我们喜欢使用control拖动，所以这里

1571
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,404
example is the calculator example.
示例是计算器示例。

1572
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:44,672
I've got a split view.
我有一个分屏视图。

1573
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,874
And in my calculator there in the upper right

1574
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,477
I have a button it's very hard to see but

1575
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,111
it's a little picture of a graph.
这是一张图的小图片。

1576
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,813
So that's the button that when I press it,
这是按钮，当我按下它时，

1577
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:55,549
it's gonna take whatever's in my calculator and graph it.
它会取计算器里的任何东西并画出来。

1578
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,019
So if I've typed in for example m cosine,
如果我输入了m cos，

1579
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:04,258
it's gonna draw a cosine wave, that's what that button does.
它会画一个余弦波，这就是这个按钮的作用。

1580
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,661
So I just go into interface builder here, control drag
我在这里输入接口生成器，control拖动

1581
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,564
from that button down to the detail right there.

1582
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:11,532
When I let go,

1585
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,003
It looks like that.
像这样。

1586
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,106
And I'm gonna pick the segue I want.
我将选择我想要的segue。

1587
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:21,675
Well, since this is a Split view, if I can,
因为这是分屏视图，如果可以，

1588
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,177
I'm going to show detail.
我将展示细节。

1589
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,079
Put it on the right side of the split view.
把它放在分屏视图的右边。

1590
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,348
Now, if I were in this same storyboard, but

1591
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,583
I was on an iPhone non-plus,
我在iPhone上没有，

1592
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,251
then even though I'm picking show detail here,
尽管我在这里选取了一些细节，

1593
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,754
it's still going to do the navigation controller show,
它还是要做导航控制器show，

1594
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,291
because there is no split view side, when I'm on the iPhone.
因为在iPhone上没有分割视图。

1595
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,894
So I pick the segue type I want, and

1596
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,229
it creates the segue.

1601
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:52,173
Cuz you don't wanna set this thing right here which

1602
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:53,841
is the identifier.

So in this case it shows a graph, so
在这个例子中，它显示了一个图

1613
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,764
I call this show graph.

1615
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,204
And that's true for navigation controller as well.
导航控制器也是这样。

1616
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,673
If you have a navigation controller and

01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,915
And then you use a show segue, and it'll just work.
然后你使用一个show segue，它只会工作。

1620
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,049
Has to be all inside,

1621
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,751
embedded in navigation controller, of course.

1622
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,720
So what can you do with these identifiers?

1624
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,425
code, with performSegue withIdentifier, but

But you can do it with performSegue.
但你可以用performSegue。

1632
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,006
But the more important use of the identifier is not causing

01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,489
method which I'm gonna show you in a moment here, okay.
我一会儿要给你们看的方法，好的。

1639
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,058
And remember, we're all segueing to a new MVC

1640
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,227
freshly created, so it's always raw.
新创建的，所以它总是原始的。

1641
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:22,830
So we have to prepare it to do what it's going to do.

1642
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:25,466
Here is the method.

1649
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,187
And very importantly, the controller that you're seguing
非常重要的是，你所segue的控制器

1650
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,455
too, because the whole point is here,

1658
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,108
So in the calculator example you're gonna have a button

1664
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,692
which we're gonna talk about week after next.
我们下周接着讲。

1665
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,561
And so that could be the sender.
这就是sender。

1666
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,364
Or you might have done perform segue on the previous slide,
或者你可能在上一张幻灯片上做了执行segue，

1667
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:32,066
that actually let you set the sender so

1672
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,477
Note that it can be nil so
注意它可以是nil

1673
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:47,447
I'm gonna say if let to get it out of that segue right there.
我想说，如果我们把它从那个segue中取出来。

1674
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,950
And I need that identifier cuz I need to know which segue I'm
我需要这个标识符因为我需要知道我是哪个segue

1675
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,486
doing because I might have three buttons

1676
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,355
on my calculator that segued to three different things.

1677
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,424
Now you're not gonna have in assignment three but you could
你不会在作业3，但你可以

1678
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,192
have multiple buttons segueing to different things.
有多个按钮来segue到不同的东西。

1679
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,062
So you need to know which segue you're talking about.

1680
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,032
So you switch on it and then you check the case.

1681
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,301
And in the case of Show Graph,
在Show Graph的例子中，

1682
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,204
which is the one we're gonna do right here,
这就是我们要做的，

1683
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:16,010
we're going to prepare that graphing MVC to do its job.
我们要准备这个图形MVC来完成它的工作。

1684
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:20,314
Now, in order to talk to that graphing MVC,
现在，为了和这个图形MVC，

1685
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,983
we have to get it as a graph controller.
我们必须把它作为一个图形控制器。

1686
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,653
Now the type of that destination view controller
目标视图控制器的类型

1687
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:29,623
that's in the segue object is just UIViewController,
这在segue对象中就是UIViewController，

1688
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,626
it doesn't know that it's a graph view controller or
它不知道它是图形视图控制器

1689
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,262
something like that it's just UIViewController.
它只是UIViewController。

1690
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,064
So we have to use as,
所以我们要用as，

1691
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:40,734
remember the "as?" I told you you could cast anything.
还记得”?“我告诉过你，你可以投任何东西。”

1692
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:44,438
Not just any object, you can cast a UIViewController to try
不只是任何对象，你可以cast一个UIViewController来尝试

1693
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:47,007
and down cast it to a specific view controller.
然后把它丢给一个特定的视图控制器。

1694
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,910
So here I'm going to try and cast the destination view
这里我将尝试转换目标视图

1695
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,445
controller to be a graph controller.
控制器是图形控制器。

1696
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,014
I'm gonna assume the graph controller is the type of
我假设图形控制器是

1697
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,884
the controller of my graph MVC.
我的图形MVC的控制器。

1698
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,819
And if I'm able to do that, which I should be,
如果我能做到这一点，

1699
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,555
because I know this is the show graph segue, so
因为我知道这是show graph segue

1700
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,224
I better be, if,
我最好,如果,

1701
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,959
if I'm not then probably I wanna raise an exception here.
如果我不是，我可能想在这里提出一个例外。

1702
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,961
Because I'm really expecting to be able to do it.
因为我真的希望能做到。

1703
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,364
Maybe I use as exclamation point right there instead of
也许我用的是感叹号，而不是

1704
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:14,101
as question mark as it'd be bad if I was doing this and
作为问号，如果我这样做会很糟糕

1705
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,836
it wasn't actually graphcontroller.
实际上这不是graphcontroller。

1706
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,505
But anyway, I get the graphcontroller so
总之，我得到了graphcontroller

1707
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:22,409
now VC, this variable VC is of type graphcontroller, so
现在VC，这个变量VC是图形控制器，所以
