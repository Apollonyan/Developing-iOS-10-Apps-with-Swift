3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,075
>> All right, well, welcome to Stanford CS193P,
欢迎参加 2017 年冬季学期斯坦福

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,714
that's Developing Applications for iOS, winter of 2017.
CS193P 课程，iOS 应用程序开发

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:20,785
So today, our topic is to talk about custom views, okay,

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,123
specifically the drawing side of having custom views.

7
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,193
And this is gonna be a more typical lecture than last

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,762
time because I'll be doing some slides and

9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,964
explaining the concepts to you, and

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,301
then I'll go into a demo that shows you how we do it all.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,104
So what is a view?

12
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,540
A view is a subclass of UIView,

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,643
which is in UIKit in iOS.

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,313
And all it does is carve out or

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,883
represent a rectangular area on screen.

16
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,019
And that rectangular area defines a coordinate space

17
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,990
that we're gonna draw in and that we're gonna get

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,124
multi-touch events like pinches and

19
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,660
swipes and all that stuff.

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,095
So today,

21
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,131
I'm just gonna focus on the drawing side of that all and

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,268
then we'll start talking about the gestures on Wednesday.

23
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,439
So these views, these little rectangle areas

24
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,542
are put on screen in this hierarchical way.

25
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,779
And that just means that the views have subviews

26
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:21,913
inside of them.

27
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,450
Now any given view can only have one superview,

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,185
that's the view that it's contained in.

29
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,054
But it can have any number of subviews,

30
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,689
so views made out of it.

31
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,324
So for example, on the calculator, we had for

32
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,493
example, stack view, okay.

33
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,195
It had a lot of subviews,

34
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,897
all the buttons that we stacked in it.

35
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,400
In fact, some of the stack views had other stack views as

36
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,067
their subviews.

37
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,302
And then those stack views had more subviews,

38
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,771
which were buttons or whatever, okay.

39
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,674
So that's how we build our UI is this hierarchical

40
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,077
collection of these rectangular areas.

41
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,014
Now, at the very, very, very top there's a special UIView

42
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,751
called UIWindow class, we don't deal with that in iOS.

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,021
In fact, the only time you would ever do anything with

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,491
the UIWindow is if you were building an app that maybe

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,193
projected to a projector.

46
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,328
So that you had two screens, your device and

47
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,963
then maybe some external projector or

48
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,199
something, then you might care about UIWindow.

49
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,069
But otherwise, it's all about UIView, okay?

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,871
All of our arrangement of the screen is all about how we

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,574
arrange the UIViews.

52
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,444
Now this hierarchy, okay, these rectangular areas inside

53
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,680
of rectangular areas, is almost always built

54
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,316
in Interface Builder, inside Xcode, okay?

55
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,817
That's how we built the stack view stuff.

56
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,752
We dragged out a bunch of buttons and

57
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,920
then we selected them and said,

58
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,890
"Embed in Stack View." Well, that wrapped it in there.

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,094
But we can also build that hierarchy by dragging views

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,929
out of the utilities,

61
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,132
bottom of the utilities window there, inside other views.

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,132
So you can drag,

63
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,703
do it by dragging-dropping inside of other views.

64
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,338
It is possible to do it in code but

65
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,207
usually we're doing it graphically.

66
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,375
If you're doing it in code,

67
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:00,912
the two main methods involved in building and

68
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:05,050
destroying this hierarchy, are addSubview, okay,

69
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,418
addSubview, takes a view as an argument.

70
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,489
You send it to the "soon-to-be" superview of that

71
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,708
In other words, you ask another view,

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:13,859
view.

73
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,928
please add this other view as subview of yourself.

74
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,864
Now when you're doing the opposite, taking some view out

75
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,467
of the hierarchy, you don't send it to the superview.

76
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,436
You send it to the actual view itself,

77
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,305
basically remove yourself from this view hierarchy.

78
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,507
So you send removeFromSuperview

79
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,977
to the actual view you want removed.

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,347
Now where does this hierarchy start?

81
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,048
I guess you could say it starts in UIWindow.

82
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,517
But for our purposes, we don't even pay attention to that.

83
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,054
It starts at the top level view

84
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,956
in that scene in Interface Builder.

85
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,225
The scene that's controlled by our view controller, right?

86
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,527
That rectangular area that we work in.

87
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,261
There's a top,

88
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,499
top level view that covers the whole space up there.

89
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,701
And there is an important instance variable,

90
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,771
property, in UIViewController.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,907
Okay, so all subclasses of UIViewController get

92
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,842
this property.

93
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,946
It's called view and it's a UIView and a top level view.

94
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:12,084
And it's very important to understand that in an MVC,

95
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,520
the controller has this, always has this var which

96
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,459
points to the very top of that view hierarchy in its scene.

97
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,430
This top level view is important because for example,

98
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,599
when you rotate, it's the thing whose bounds changes,

99
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,801
that top level view.

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,336
And you're gonna learn a little later that when

101
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,606
the bounds of a view changes, there's a mechanism for

102
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,043
offering all of its subviews an opportunity to change.

103
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,712
So that's why when we rotate device,

104
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,281
that top level view changes from being tall and

105
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,085
thin to being wide and less tall.

106
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,654
And that causes all those stack views and

107
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,123
everything else to start getting resized as well,

108
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,361
because they're all subviews of this top level view, okay?

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,497
If you were going to add views to the view hierarchy

110
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,866
programmatically rather than dragging and

111
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,502
dropping them, then you would need this view because it's

112
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,204
the top of the entire view hierarchy.

113
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,606
And you would kinda work your way down

114
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,907
to find out where you want to put that view.

115
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,410
But we don't otherwise actually look at this view

116
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,846
much because we usually have outlets, rights?

117
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,982
IBOutlets--like the display that points to the label--that

118
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,484
gives us access to that label.

119
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,451
That's all we want, so

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,988
we don't have to go looking at the top level view and

121
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,290
looking all down the views, okay?

122
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,059
So this is important to know about but

123
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,896
surprisingly you don't access it that much, okay.

124
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,764
This view is automatically hooked up for you in

125
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,967
Interface Builder when you drag out a View Controller.

126
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,002
It's just all magically hooked up,

127
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,071
you don't have to worry about that.

128
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,241
Okay, let's talk about initialization of the UIView.

129
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,378
As usual, when you saw the lecture from last time,

130
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,981
you probably realize, whoa, initialization has a lot of

131
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,152
caveats when you're talking about initializing a class,

132
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,170
Remember all those rules I was going through?

133
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:56,121
right?

134
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,224
Required convenience and its inheritance, all this stuff.

135
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,960
So we try to avoid initializers generally as much

136
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,963
as we can by doing all the things I talked

137
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,932
about on Wednesday, like setting things equal or

138
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,501
even using lazy or something like that.

139
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,170
But if you can't avoid it,

140
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,873
UIView has an interesting initializer situation.

141
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:19,343
It has two initializers that you have to deal with.

142
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,513
Okay, one of them, init, with the frame is the argument, is

143
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,549
the one that you would call if you're trying to create a view

144
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:30,155
in code, which you'll probably never do in this class, okay?

145
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,555
Because you're always gonna use or

146
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,425
do it in Interface Builder with Xcode.

147
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,261
But, so that's the kind of in-code one.

148
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,097
And init with this coder thing,

149
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,566
which I'll talk about right at the end of class,

150
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,302
but it's not important to know early on.

151
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,371
That's the init that gets called when your stuff come

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,874
outs of Interface Builder, right?

153
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,377
When it comes from, when you built in Xcode.

154
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,312
All the stuff that you're building in Interface Builder

155
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,214
essentially gets coded,

156
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,383
that's what this coder business is about.

157
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,553
Gets coded into an XML file, kind of freeze dried.

158
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,323
And then when you run your program, that XML file gets

159
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,591
loaded in and it's kind of the instructions for

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,929
how to create all those objects, okay?

161
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,864
And init with coder is the initializer it uses

162
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,232
to recreate the view.

163
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,402
So if you have any code that needs to go in an initializer,

164
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,804
like you need to initialize some var in your UIView,

165
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,806
you have to do it like this.

166
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,741
Override both of these inits,

167
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,911
one of them is a required init, the coder one.

168
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,780
And we create some other method like this green setup

169
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,615
method I have.

170
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,118
And just call that method from both of them.

171
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,653
That way you're guaranteed that whether your custom view

172
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,156
is created in code or created in Interface Builder,

173
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:43,694
it will get initialized properly.

174
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,697
If you have vars that have to be initialized, you may not be

175
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,501
able to use this mechanism of course because you can't

176
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,337
call methods in yourself until you're initialized.

177
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,706
So you might have to have that var initialization be

178
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,142
somewhat duplicated there.

179
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,978
There's another alternative to initialization though and this

180
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,514
is for any other object that comes out of Interface Builder

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
which is called awakeFromNib.

182
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,018
Okay, awakeFromNib.

183
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,554
This is sent to every single object that ever comes out

184
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,491
of Interface Builder file, okay, that you edit

185
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,125
in the story board there including views and

186
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,426
your View Controller for that matter.

187
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,664
And so

188
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,634
the "Your object must be completely initialized."

189
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,271
Those restrictions are not satisfied by this.

190
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,940
But still you can put code in there, you get, get going.

191
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,475
And we're gonna learn all kinds of ways to do

192
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,944
initialization throughout our system down the road,

193
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,514
but that's basically how you initialize UIViews.

194
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,085
Okay so we're gonna talk now about UIView

195
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,287
as this rectangular area in which we're gonna draw.

196
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,256
And so to do that we need talk about some types.

197
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,492
They're some very important types that you need to know.

198
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,627
One of them is CGFloat.

199
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,796
So CGFloat is a floating point value.

200
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,665
All of your coordinates that you're gonna be drawing in

201
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,668
are all floating point values, but they're not doubles,

202
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,238
they're not floats, they're CGFloats.

203
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,206
So this is a type,

204
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,142
a real type that you have to use all the time

205
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,378
when you're doing anything with the drawing, okay?

206
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,947
CG stands for Core Graphics,

207
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,916
this is the "graphics float" right here, okay?

208
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,553
There's also a CGPoint which is just a struct with two

209
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,956
things in it, x and y, they're both CGFloats, CGPoint

210
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,993
represents a point in your coordinate system somewhere.

211
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,395
Again, floating point coordinates.

212
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,465
There's also CGSize, which represents an extent.

213
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,134
You know, a width and a height, okay?

214
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,370
Only, it's just the struct, with two CGFloats, width and

215
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,805
height, simple.

216
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,775
And there's CGRect, of course, which is a rectangle.

217
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,844
It's a struct that has an origin, which is CGPoint, and

218
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,445
an extent, which is a size.

219
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,282
So a rectangle represents a size, okay?

220
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,585
So creating a CGRect--there's actually quite a few

221
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,953
initializers for it.

222
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,087
You can create an origin and size,

223
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,490
you can do an x y with height, things like that.

224
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,792
And CGRect also has a lot of really cool,

225
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:59,630
little convenience vars and funcs and thing like that.

226
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,399
maxY, midY, those'll tell you thing like where's the left

227
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,100
Like minX,

228
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,370
edge of your rect to the top to the left or the bottom.

229
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,239
The middle points, etc.

230
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,976
There's also nice functions like intersects other rect

231
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,846
will return whether the two rectangles cross over.

232
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:18,182
And there's even contains whether a point

233
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,351
is inside the rectangle, etc.

234
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,253
So there's quite a few of these.

235
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,587
I can't put them all on the slide, so

236
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,024
you're gonna wanna familiarize yourselves with CGRect.

237
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,827
Because it probably has a lot of things in there that

238
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,162
you would otherwise be writing your own code to do.

239
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,164
Okay, so now that we have those types,

240
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,734
those four types, we can start talking about this coordinate

241
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,104
system that we're gonna be doing our drawing in.

242
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,805
Now, the most important thing to understand,

243
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,808
the simplest thing, is that the origin of this coordinate

244
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,211
system is in the upper left of the screen.

245
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,481
It's not Cartesian coordinates which the origin would be in

246
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,716
the lower left of the screen because in Cartesian

247
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,986
coordinates increasing y means up, but

248
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,255
in this coordinate system increasing y means going down,

249
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,156
down the screen, okay?

250
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,625
So very important to understand that.

251
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:06,063
So you can see that point I have up there, 500,35 that's

252
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:11,302
500 over and 35 down from the origin upper left, okay?

253
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,874
Now, the units in here that we're drawing are points.

254
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,043
Okay, be very careful that you understand the unit

255
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,245
terminology here, okay?

256
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,281
It's in points, not pixels.

257
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,784
A pixel is like the smallest possible little light

258
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,120
that can be turned on on your screen.

259
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,023
Okay, now some devices have a lot of pixels

260
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,394
per point--they're very dense.

261
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,030
And that's really great, because if you're drawing

262
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,899
smooth curves--like fonts are just

263
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,568
smooth curves being drawn--you don't get jaggy edges,

264
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,204
because there's so many tiny little points, okay?

265
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,308
But we can't make it, so that we draw in the pixel space,

266
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:54,111
otherwise, on a very dense pixel screen,

267
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,980
our image would be really small.

268
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,815
And then, in an undense one, it'd be really big,

269
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,217
because the pixels are really big.

270
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,419
So we instead of drawing in pixels,

271
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,154
we draw in points, okay?

272
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,757
This is the same point by the way that is like the point

273
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,558
size of a font.

274
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:11,162
A 12 point font, same word there, same point, okay?

275
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,601
So, you can find out though how many pixels there are per

276
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,304
point, in other words how high resolution your screen is,

277
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:23,508
with this var in UIView called contentScaleFactor.

278
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,710
It's a CGFloat, it's either gonna be one, two, or

279
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,044
three currently.

280
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,480
Like, the iPhone 7 Plus is three.

281
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,216
Three pixels per point in each direction.

282
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:37,088
And the older like iPhone 4s maybe?

283
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,457
Maybe all the way back to the 4 would be one.

284
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,193
Okay, some of the older iPads would be one.

285
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,495
The newer iPads would be two.

286
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,863
So, If you're doing anything where you have to pay

287
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,164
Okay?

288
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,033
attention to the number of pixels of points,

289
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,167
this is what you need.

290
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,770
Now the great thing is, most of the time you don't care

291
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,773
because when you're using iOS to draw with a font,

292
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,642
it's automatically gonna do super smooth turns, and

293
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,978
you don't even have to know what the scale factor is.

294
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,846
Even if you're just drawing an arc,

295
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,083
it'll make sure you do as little jaggies as possible.

296
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,785
So, you rarely have to know this.

297
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,753
But actually, wake up.

298
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,355
You do need to know for assignment three, okay?

299
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,857
So assignment three, you will have to know this.

300
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,027
Alright, now.

301
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,965
The most important var in all of UIView is this one: bounds.

302
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,135
And even in that really important var,

303
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,273
really what you care about is the size.

304
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,576
This is, in your drawing coordinate system,

305
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,378
the space you have to draw in.

306
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,515
This is basically the size of your view in your own drawing

307
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,683
coordinate system.

308
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,818
So any time you're doing any drawing and

309
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,688
you wanna draw something that's as wide as your view,

310
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,223
you're gonna use bounds.size.width here.

311
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,560
And you're almost always gonna have your bounds' origin be

312
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,897
(0, 0) so if you want put something in upper left you're

313
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,200
gonna put it at (0, 0) or close to (0, 0).

314
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,334
So this rect, bounds,

315
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,336
is describing the area have to draw in.

316
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,839
Now it's important because you obviously want to,

317
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,142
depending on your size, draw yourself appropriately.

318
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,812
And it's also important because there are two other

319
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,016
vars that often get confused by students with bounds, and

320
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,920
which are quite different: that is frame and center.

321
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,825
So frame and center have nothing to do

322
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,994
with where you're drawing, that's bounds.

323
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,665
Frame and center is where you are in your super view.

324
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,136
So here's a picture of that frame and center.

325
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,473
So center is where your center is in your superview's

326
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,309
coordinate system and frame is a rectangle that completely

327
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,612
encases you in your superview's coordinate system.

328
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,515
And you might think, well the size of my frame is gonna be

329
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,752
exactly the same size as my bounds size, right?

330
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:53,157
And the answer is no, because views can be rotated.

331
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,194
And if you have ever rotated a view like this green one,

332
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,962
Inside the code that's drawing in View B, its bounds just

333
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,663
View B.

334
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,933
looks like a normal rectangle, the fact that it's rotated,

335
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,934
it doesn't even know it's rotated.

336
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,637
But if you look at the center of it, or if you look at

337
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,574
the frame that encloses it, look, it's not the same size.

338
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,193
It has to be bigger because, to the superview, View A,

339
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,744
It's bigger.

340
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,547
View B kinda looks like a diamond, right?

341
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,915
So it has to be bigger.

342
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:22,920
So the bottom line here, never use frame or center to draw.

343
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,923
Frame and center are only used to position you

344
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:26,557
in your super view.

345
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,126
Okay, you can use either one.

346
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,794
If you set the center, it'll move the frame,

347
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,896
if you set the frame, it'll adjust the center, okay.

348
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,764
They're tied together.

349
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,699
Okay.

350
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,735
How do we create views?

351
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,336
Okay, because I already told you we don't really use

352
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,571
the initializer, we don't, you know,

353
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,406
create them in code very much.

354
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,474
What we usually do is we drag them out

355
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,474
Okay?

356
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,411
from the Object Palette in the bottom of the utilities window

357
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,013
in Interface Builder.

358
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,316
But if I built a custom view, Paul's view or

359
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:56,420
something, it's not going to be in the palette, okay.

360
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,556
Xcode didn't ship with my view in the palette.

361
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,491
So instead, there's a generic view, just plain UIView, and

362
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,594
you're gonna drag that in.

363
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,696
But then, you're gonna inspect it using the top half of

364
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,298
the utilities pane on the right, right?

365
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,200
You're gonna inspect it and

366
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,568
change its class to not be UIView.

367
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,272
It's gonna be your subclass of UIView, so Paul view or

368
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,673
whatever, okay?

369
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,374
And this is a very important step to remember.

370
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,977
When you create a custom view and you drag it into your UI,

371
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,346
you have to change its class to be your custom class.

372
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,615
And we'll see that in the demo, how it works.

373
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,385
When you create it in code, of course,

374
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,319
you're just doing UIView(frame:),

375
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,888
and you provide the frame, okay?

376
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,357
And that frame, remember, what does it describe?

377
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,826
Describes where this view is gonna be in its super view

378
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,097
when it gets added, that's all the frame is doing, okay?

379
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,232
And you can create it with UIView(), no arguments.

380
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,234
Then it will be zero width, zero height, and

381
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,903
it'll be at zero, zero, so you won't even see it, so.

382
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,070
But you could come along later and

383
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,508
change its frame and/or its center to move it around.

384
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,210
Here, it's a really quick example,

385
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,245
how to create a view in code.

386
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,413
I'm gonna create a UILabel.

387
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,283
UILabel is just a subclass of UIView.

388
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,719
And notice that on the second line there,

389
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,255
I'm just saying label = UILabel(frame:) of whatever.

390
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,992
So I'm giving it this frame, 20, 20, 150, right?

391
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,427
And then I'm setting the text to "Hello".

392
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,497
Well, if I was doing this code in a UIViewController,

393
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,866
then I could put it at that top level view,

394
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,769
it'd look like that, view.addSubview, okay?

395
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,438
And it would add the subview.

396
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,540
Custom views, so why do I ever need a custom view?

397
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,410
Either I need to do custom drawing or

398
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,479
I need to do custom multi-touch input, okay?

399
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,480
Those are the reasons

400
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,682
that you're gonna create a custom view.

401
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,284
And so we're gonna focus on the drawing, and

402
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,754
the drawing is very, very simple, okay?

403
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,556
There's this one method that's called draw.

404
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,626
And it takes one argument, which is a rect.

405
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,062
For historical reasons, we sometimes call it drawrect,

406
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,165
but it's not actually called drawrect anymore.

407
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,001
It's called draw, and the argument is called rect.

408
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,907
And this draw is gonna be sent to you by the system.

409
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,742
It's sent to your UIView subclass,

410
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,345
you override it, and it gets sent to you by the system when

411
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,447
the system wants you to draw yourself.

412
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,450
This is the only way you can draw in your view,

413
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,019
is to be asked by the system to draw.

414
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,524
There is no other way to draw in iOS.

415
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,793
So what's that rectangle about?

416
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,462
That rectangle is some sub-area in your bounds

417
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,930
that it wants you to draw.

418
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,533
Now, that's a performance enhancement, because you can

419
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,269
ignore that and draw your whole view, if you'd like.

420
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,438
But like in your assignment three, you're probably gonna

421
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,106
wanna pay attention to this rectangle because

422
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,510
your assignment three's draw is gonna be pretty expensive,

423
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,846
so you wanna draw as little as possible.

424
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,914
So that's what this draw is, very simple,

425
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,117
it's just called by the system, time for you to draw.

426
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,385
It's the only way to draw.

427
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,855
So it's really, really easy to understand.

428
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,325
Never call this method, ever.

429
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,827
If you ever call this method, it's wrong.

430
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,895
The system calls this method,

431
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,198
the system's the only one who calls this method.

432
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,233
So what happens if you need to draw?

433
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,468
Something changed, and you wanna redraw.

434
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,638
You call one of these two methods, setNeedsDisplay or

435
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,873
setNeedsDisplay with the argument of a rect.

436
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,309
And that's telling the system, hey, system,

437
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,744
my view needs to be redrawn.

438
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,212
Please ask me to redraw it.

439
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,247
And at some appropriate time in the future,

440
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,915
it will ask you to redraw it.

441
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,218
But it knows better than you when the best time to draw is,

442
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,486
believe me.

443
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,721
And the rect that you can pass, that's just the rect

444
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,723
that's gonna be passed onto your draw.

445
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,426
So setNeedsDisplay with a rect is like an optimized

446
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,494
setNeedsDisplay.

447
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,695
It's like, I need to be redrawn, but

448
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,596
only this part of me.

449
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:30,701
And you can send this to any UIView, say, redraw this view.

450
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,069
Usually, views send it to themselves though because

451
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,774
they're the ones who know best when they need to be redrawn,

452
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,441
okay?

453
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,643
Alright.

454
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:43,580
So, how do I implement this drawrect,

455
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,352
draw, draw with a CGRect argument guy?

456
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,554
And the answer is, you're gonna do it with paths.

457
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,057
You're gonna create paths, and then you're going to stroke

458
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,161
them and fill them to make shapes and things like that.

459
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,097
And then you're also gonna use text and images.

460
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,134
So that's the primary way that you're going to draw

461
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,167
in there, okay?

462
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,103
So we'll talk about text and images in a minute.

463
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,171
Let's talk about the drawing with the paths first.

464
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,473
There's really two ways to do it.

465
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,442
One is, you can get what's called a context,

466
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,010
a drawing context, and I'll show you how to get it.

467
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,547
And then you can send messages to that context like, move to

468
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,718
this point, draw a line to here, add an arc over here,

469
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,655
put some text over here, things like that, okay?

470
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,256
Actually, the text we're gonna do in a different way,

471
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,892
but, so that's one way.

472
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,028
And then the other way is, you can create a path object,

473
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,798
okay, using UIBezierPath, and it's the same kind of thing.

474
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,067
But you're gonna create this object that you're gonna tell

475
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,403
that object, okay, I want this path to be moving to here, and

476
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,438
then a line here, and then an arc over to here, okay?

477
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,606
So you create this path, and

478
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,709
then you send a message to that path saying, okay,

479
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,810
stroke it.

480
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,744
So it's a subtle difference, but you'll see.

481
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,880
We're gonna focus mainly on the UIBezierPath way,

482
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,415
because it's kind of a little simpler.

483
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,517
So let's understand the concepts here of

484
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,153
Core Graphics, that's what the CG is that you're seeing in

485
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,020
all the places here.

486
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,224
And the number one thing about Core Graphics is,

487
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,391
we need a context.

488
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,927
And that context might be a drawing context for on-screen,

489
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,062
it might be a printing context if we're printing,

490
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,999
might be a context of drawing to an off-screen bitmap, etc.

491
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,236
The one you care about is obviously the context to

492
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,937
draw in your drawrect.

493
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,539
And you get that by calling this function.

494
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,573
This is just a Swift function,

495
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,975
it's not on a class or anything.

496
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,511
UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), and

497
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,847
that's going to get you a context that you can then

498
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,618
tell it to create a path by moving and all that stuff.

499
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,387
Which is what you do then, you create these paths out of

500
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,623
lines and arcs and things like that.

501
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,359
Then you set drawing attributes in the context,

502
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,962
like the colors you wanna use, the fonts if you're doing

503
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,432
text, line widths, those kinds of things.

504
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,300
You set those all up, and then you stroke and fill.

505
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,801
And that's it, stroking and

506
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,804
filling are actually the only two directives that actually

507
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,740
cause something to happen on screen.

508
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,574
But keep in mind that, like,

509
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:55,279
a font is basically just a really exquisite path filled,

510
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,614
okay, or stroked and filled.

511
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,884
So you can do a lot with stroking and filling.

512
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,420
So UIBezierPath kinda encapsulates all of those

513
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,956
Core Graphics concepts into an object.

514
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,525
And so I have an example here to show you how I would use

515
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,929
UIBezierPath to draw a triangle on screen.

516
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,965
First, I'm gonna create the path by just saying,

517
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,099
path = UIBezierPath().

518
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,768
There are other initializers for it,

519
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,735
which we'll see in the demo.

520
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,371
But this one just creates a blank path to start.

521
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,206
Then, you move around with the path.

522
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,876
So like I can say, move to, which (80,

523
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,480
50) is like halfway across this, this little screen.

524
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,949
This is small screen, let's say, 160 points wide.

525
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,751
80 and then 50 down, okay?

526
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,556
Then I'm gonna add a line down to 140, 50, see that, okay?

527
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,659
Then I'm gonna add another line over to 10,

528
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,929
off to the left, I'm still 150 down.

529
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,832
Then I'm gonna close the path, okay, using close, and

530
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,101
that just closes it back to the start.

531
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,436
So look, I made a triangle, okay, really easy.

532
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,940
Now, the only thing is, all this code right here would

533
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,410
actually draw, instead of that triangle right there,

534
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,113
would draw this: nothing.

535
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,083
You would see no drawing with that code because we haven't

536
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,117
stroked or filled it.

537
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,386
The stroking and filling is what draws.

538
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,754
So how do we do the stroking and fill?

539
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,157
Well, we need to set the colors that we wanna fill and

540
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,792
stroke with.

541
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,261
But here, I'm taking green and

542
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,829
sending it the message setFill.

543
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,865
So you actually set your color to fill with

544
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,601
by sending a message to a color.

545
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,969
You get a color, and you send it a message,

546
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,237
set that as my fill color.

547
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,104
And the same thing with a stroke,

548
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:28,772
set it as a stroke color.

549
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,842
So I set my stroke color to red, my fill color to green.

550
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,613
But when I'm talking about attributes like line width,

551
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,716
I send that to the path, to the UIBezierPath.

552
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,318
Set your line width to three, okay, so I do that.

553
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:45,622
Now, if I say path.fill, now I get a green triangle.

554
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,823
Because my fill color was green,

555
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,859
and it takes that path and it fills it in.

556
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,594
That's what fill does.

557
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,563
And similarly, if I say path.stroke,

558
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,332
I get a red line around.

559
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,802
Because the path that I took to get around there gets

560
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,206
stroked with a three-point wide red line.

561
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,841
So that's it, that's quite simple actually.

562
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,543
That's how we draw.

563
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,979
And, UIBezierPath also knows how to draw a lot of common

564
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,380
Okay?

565
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,350
shapes, like rounded rectangles, and ovals, and

566
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,053
things like that, so you should familiarize yourself

567
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,256
with UIBezierPath's API, of course.

568
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,392
Another cool thing you can do with UIBezierPath is you

569
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,094
create a path like that triangle, and

570
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,798
you can clip all your drawings to that path.

571
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,367
So you could draw this elaborate picture that only

572
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:33,003
show the part that shows through that triangle,

573
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,938
if you take that triangle path that we just created and

574
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,073
say add clip to it.

575
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:37,841
Because after that,

576
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,012
all drawing is only gonna show up inside that triangle,

577
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,381
you can make some pretty cool effects by doing it.

578
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,683
which is kinda cool,

579
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,485
The UIBezierPath also knows how to,

580
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,521
it has this method contains that will,

581
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,389
tell you whether a point is inside the path.

582
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,126
So that's good if you want to do some touch thing or people

583
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,962
are touching on something and you wanna do hit detection,

584
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,997
basically, what they're touching on.

585
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,933
All right, and there's tons of other stuff in UIBezierPath,

586
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,567
don't have time to cover it, you should look it up.

587
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,369
Okay, UIColor.

588
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,972
So UIColor, really simple.

589
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,641
Okay, there's some common colors like green, red,

590
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,808
yellow, purple.

591
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,610
Those have type methods on UIColor.

592
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,278
Remember, type methods, static methods?

593
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,046
They're on the type.

594
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,247
You don't need an instance of it.

595
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,416
So that's like UIColor.green.

596
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,686
But there's also initializers that let you create colors

597
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:27,057
from RGB, red, green, blue, or HSB, that's hue, saturation,

598
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,575
You can even create a color that's made from a pattern.

599
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,026
brightness.

600
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,794
So that when you draw with that color,

601
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,296
it's drawing in a pattern.

602
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,164
Okay, like a really thick line,

603
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,099
we'd actually be showing the details of a pattern,

604
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,067
which is kind of fun, using UIImage,

605
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,303
which I'll talk about in a little bit.

606
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,640
Of course, all UIViews have a background color.

607
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,743
We saw this when we did our buttons in the calculator,

608
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,211
we made the background color

609
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,848
of a lot of our buttons be light gray, and I'm sure in

610
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,649
the homework assignments you made it other colors.

611
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,718
Okay, that's just a var on UIView,

612
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,820
that button inherited from UIView.

613
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,155
And you can set it to any UIColor you want.

614
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,359
Now, an interesting thing about colors though is that

615
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,163
they can be transparent, or even semi-transparent, okay?

616
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,299
And they are done, you specify that with alpha.

617
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,900
How many people here know what alpha

618
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:11,936
is when it comes to graphics?

619
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,137
Okay, so hardly anybody.

620
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:18,141
So alpha is just a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means

621
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,144
fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.

622
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,247
So if you have a color like a triangle and

623
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,016
you fill it with green, then if it's fully opaque,

624
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,551
you can't see anything behind that triangle.

625
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,787
But if it were 50%, 0.5 alpha,

626
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,189
then you'd be able to see the green but

627
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,927
you'd also be able to see the things behind it a little bit.

628
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,728
50% kinda, okay?

629
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,230
If it was zero, you wouldn't see any

630
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,165
green because it would be fully transparent.

631
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,267
You'd be looking all the way through it, so

632
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,102
you wouldn't see any green, okay?

633
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,304
So, all that you can put anywhere in that range, and

634
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,906
the way you create a transparent color is by taking

635
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,710
a opaque color and saying, withAlphaComponent,

636
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,946
whatever alpha you want between 0 and 1.

637
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,281
Okay? And that gives you

638
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,314
a transparent or

639
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,251
semi-transparent version of the color.

640
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,352
And you can draw with that.

641
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:07,557
However, if you draw with transparency in your UIView,

642
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,927
you must set this var on your UIView.

643
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,530
This is just a var in UIView to false.

644
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,265
Okay? Because views assume that

645
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,234
they're fully opaque, okay?

646
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,035
And that's performance enhancement.

647
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,870
It turns out drawing with transparency,

648
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,173
as you might imagine, takes a little bit of CPU power

649
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,042
to figure out which pixels show through and all that.

650
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,878
So, by default, it assumes you're drawing fully opaque.

651
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,480
So if you wanna draw with transparency,

652
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,050
don't forget to set opaque here to false.

653
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,921
By the way, you can make your entire view semi-transparent

654
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,389
by setting its alpha.

655
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,558
So this is a var, not in color,

656
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,226
this is a var in UIView.

657
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,995
You can say, alpha 0.5,

658
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,899
in your entire view will be 50% see-through.

659
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,267
And that would work with a button or

660
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,102
anything because those are just UIViews.

661
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,071
Alright?

662
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,709
What happens when views overlap and

663
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,944
we have transparency in the views?

664
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,214
Well, then that subviews that we're talking about,

665
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,951
all the subviews of a view starts to matter in the order.

666
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,486
So the first thing in the subview,

667
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,689
subview sub zero, that's all the way in the back.

668
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,925
And then everything else is in the order in front of

669
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,859
it, okay?

670
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,062
And so, any transparency that's going on is things

671
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,598
stacked up in that order, and you're looking down through

672
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,334
the transparency, all the way up to subview zero,

673
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,437
so which is in the back, okay?

674
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,406
You can also completely hide a view.

675
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,043
This is very similar--almost identical to--saying

676
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:33,977
alpha equals zero.

677
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,812
Which will just make the view not even appear, but

678
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,246
it will be still in the view hierarchy.

679
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,049
It will be still in its superview and

680
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,384
its subviews will still be subviews of it, but

681
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,753
it all will be completely hidden.

682
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,155
And why would you wanna do this?

683
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,492
Maybe you have some UI where you don't wanna show a button

684
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,060
until the user has entered some other field or

685
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:51,695
something like that.

686
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,929
But you wanna make room for the button.

687
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,931
You want it to be ready to appear, so

688
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,434
you leave it in the view hierarchy, but hidden.

689
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,437
Okay? Alright,

690
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:01,638
let's talk about drawing text.

691
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,605
How do we draw text?

692
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,108
Well, one way to draw text you already know is UILabel.

693
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,078
You could just create a UILabel and make it a subview

694
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,280
of your view and bingo, you got some text in your view.

695
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,082
And now, the only problem with that is,

696
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,452
you're drawing in your draw, your drawRect thing,

697
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,919
you're drawing in there.

698
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,589
And you have to make sure you drew, if you're drawing around

699
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,725
the text that it all lined up with your subviews.

700
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,328
So sometimes you wanna draw in drawRect, right?

701
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,495
You want to actually draw in there.

702
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,464
And the way you do that is with a class called

703
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,833
NSAttributedString, okay?

704
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,504
So NSAttributedString is not a string.

705
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,607
It's not related in any way actually to string, and

706
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,844
it's not even an NSString which is the old Objective-C

707
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,813
style string that was indexed by ints where

708
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,650
the Swift's one is indexed by string.index, unfortunately.

709
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,486
It's neither of those, it's its own thing.

710
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,220
Okay?

711
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,790
It's very closely aligned to old NSString,

712
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,725
not as closely aligned to the modern string.

713
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,695
But anyway, what an attributed string is it's a string,

714
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,864
you can make it out of a string or an NSString.

715
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,267
And those characters have attributes, colors and

716
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,370
fonts and things like that, okay?

717
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,337
And it's very simple,

718
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,772
you create one of these strings and

719
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,708
you just send it to message draw at and it will draw

720
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:15,045
that string at that point at its upper left corner.

721
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,997
Then you can even find out the size it's going to need to

722
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:19,047
Okay?

723
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,352
draw it by sending the message size to an attributed string.

724
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,954
Okay? Now one thing that's

725
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,422
kind of bummer about attributed string,

726
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,928
it's really an old style API,

727
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,065
var and let don't even work to make it mutable or not.

728
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,368
So if you want a mutable attributed string, attributed

729
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,236
string where you're gonna change its attributes and

730
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,005
change its text, you need to have a different class called

731
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,010
NSMutableAttributedString.

732
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,945
So things like set attributes, and things of that,

733
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,380
don't work on an attributed string.

734
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,917
You have a mutable attributed string.

735
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:56,486
Now, you can, if you have an attributed string, mutable or

736
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,422
not, you can get back the string that's in it

737
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:03,493
as a string object using the var string, or

738
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,128
mutable string in a mutable case.

739
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:07,763
That's kinda confusing because,

740
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,333
of course, you're used to var and let being how a string is

741
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,970
mutable or not, but that's how you can get the string back.

742
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,872
But let's talk about how you set the attributes.

743
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,142
So you set the attributes just by passing in this dictionary,

744
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,043
called attributes there.

745
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:23,113
You can either set attributes or add attributes to what's

746
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,282
already there, and this dictionary, String:Any,

747
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,985
the string is just a key like this is telling you what

748
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,422
the attribute is, like it's a font, or a color, or whatever.

749
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,723
And then the Any is,

750
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,258
it might be a font, it might be a color,

751
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,161
depends on what the key is, that's why it's an Any there,

752
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,464
because it can be all kinds of things.

753
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,799
And really important to notice here is the range.

754
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,500
You see that range?

755
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,270
It's not range that I talked to you on Wednesday,

756
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,938
it's NSRange.

757
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,042
NSRange is an integer indexed range into that string,

758
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,512
that attributed string.

759
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,881
Old style integer, not string.index.

760
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,117
So this makes for a lot of trouble when you're using

761
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,653
attributed string in the Swift world.

762
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:07,156
And my recommendation to you is that you use this method or

763
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,792
this var rather on String called utf16.

764
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,462
utf16 will give you back what's called

765
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,197
a String.UTF16View.

766
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,634
That is a collection of the characters, it's not really

767
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,304
a collection like characters is, but it is a representation

768
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,975
of the string as distinct 16-bit Unicode characters.

769
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,510
Which is much more aligned, in fact I think it's exactly

770
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,280
aligned, to what NSString does.

771
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,616
The only problem is, that thing that it gets,

772
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,351
that comes back, is still indexed by String.Index.

773
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,588
So you have to say what's the startIndex, offset by five,

774
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,124
that kind of business to move around in there.

775
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,093
And plus, you can't pass a range of String.Index into

776
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,228
this setAttribute.

777
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,364
So you have to kinda convert from String.Index,

778
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,466
how much you've advanced over,

779
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,003
to an integer when you make these NSRanges.

780
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,571
So, I'm sorry to say it's difficult.

781
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm not gonna actually ask you to do that,

782
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,374
this in the homework.

783
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,176
Partially because it, it's kind of a pain in the neck.

784
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,445
And I don't want you to spend your valuable homework

785
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,179
time working on it.

786
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,315
But just know, if you start using this,

787
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,919
that you're gonna have this unfortunate disconnect.

788
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,087
And I keep hoping every time iOS comes out,

789
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,723
they'll come out with an attributed string, not NS, but

790
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,225
attributed string, that's matched up with string.

791
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,161
But they haven't done it yet.

792
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,230
It's pretty complicated to do, I can imagine, so.

793
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,600
So what are some of these attributes that you can set?

794
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,302
So there's things like NSForegroundColorAttributeN-

795
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,471
ame, that's how you set the color of the text.

796
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,241
There's also NSBackgroundColorAttributeName

797
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,343
which, fonts have foregrounds and backgrounds, but

798
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,612
don't worry about that too much.

799
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,413
NSStrokeWidth so

800
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,082
you can draw your characters really thick or thin.

801
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,585
NSFontAttributeName, where you can provide a font.

802
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,187
And there's about 15 others,

803
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,957
and you can go look in the documentation for all of them.

804
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,024
But speaking of fonts,

805
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,259
if you wanna set the font you're gonna draw with,

806
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,127
how do you do that?

807
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,297
Well, fonts are super important in iOS.

808
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,100
Never underestimate the power of a font in building

809
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,001
a cool UI.

810
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:58,935
Look at all these UIs.

811
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,971
Look at how important the choice of font, size,

812
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,774
position, all that stuff is.

813
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,377
So, how do we get a good font so that our UI will look good?

814
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,914
Well, we're gonna use this very important static

815
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:11,881
method in UIFont.

816
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,551
So you send this to UIFont, the class,

817
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,720
called preferredFont forTextStyle, okay?

818
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,457
And so you can specify the text style, which is kind of

819
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,360
like, what's the environment you're gonna use this text,

820
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,461
what kinda text is it?

821
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,531
And so there's about eight or so of them.

822
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,300
But three of them are like a headline.

823
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,334
This is gonna be a headline.

824
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,404
So that's gonna be a bolder font, a little larger maybe.

825
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,540
Then body font, that's like, this is the user's data.

826
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,575
So in a Mail message,

827
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,110
this would be the message they're actually typing

828
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,346
maybe--although it's probably a multi-font.

829
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,682
But, and then footnote would just be a small little text,

830
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,151
you see, from the bottom?

831
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,121
So I really encourage you when you're using a font,

832
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,756
try to find a text style that will work, okay?

833
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,291
Because it's gonna be in sync and

834
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,060
compatible with all the other apps,

835
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,395
because they're using these preferred fonts.

836
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,132
And also, by the way, if a user goes in Settings and

837
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,367
sets their font size to be really large,

838
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,802
these will automatically get larger, okay?

839
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,207
And, hopefully, if you have your Auto-Layout working,

840
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,743
everything will expand or contract properly, okay?

841
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,378
There's also system fonts.

842
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,580
Don't get confused between the preferred fonts and

843
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,751
system fonts.

844
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,020
Preferred fonts are for the user's content.

845
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,157
So, that's the difference there.

846
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,626
Now, most of this stuff, again,

847
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,160
you're not even gonna set in code.

848
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,196
You're gonna set it in Interface Builder in

849
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,997
the little Inspector window, right?

850
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,700
You're gonna be setting, both preferred fonts and

851
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,736
system fonts can be set there.

852
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,474
If you wanna use a specific font like Helvetica Bold 13

853
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,843
point, you can do that.

854
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,011
I don't recommend it,

855
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,114
but UIFontDescriptor is an important class to know

856
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,299
It's how you describe that font that you want,

857
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,416
for that.

858
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,417
that special font.

859
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,153
So, you know, some apps, typography is what they do.

860
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,622
And so they need to be able to do specific fonts.

861
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,358
Alright, so that's text.

862
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,993
How about drawing images?

863
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,829
So images, again, you, we have a thing like UILabel.

864
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,897
It's called UIImageView.

865
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,033
And you could just make an image be a subview of

866
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,369
your view if you wanted to have an image in there.

867
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,171
But, again, sometimes you wanna be able to control that

868
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,373
in your draw, your drawRect.

869
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,742
And we do that with the UIImage object, okay?

870
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,578
I already showed you actually when I was talking about

871
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,846
failable initializers how to create a UIImage.

872
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,016
You just put it in your xcassets file

873
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,884
in Interface Builder.

874
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,622
And then you say UIImage named, and it gets it by name.

875
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,457
And if it can't find it, it returns nil.

876
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,193
So that's the number one way you're gonna get an image into

877
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,661
your app is put it in xcassets.

878
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,863
But there are other ways to do it.

879
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,665
You can get it from a file, like if you had a .jpg file.

880
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,800
Of course, I haven't shown you how to get files.

881
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,369
So you don't know how to do that yet.

882
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,471
But, you can do it that way.

883
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,240
And you can also get it just from raw data, raw jpg data or

884
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,977
something that you got over the Internet or from a URL or

885
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,711
something, you can do that.

886
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,548
You can even do it by drawing with all those path things.

887
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,150
You can use this UIGraphicsBeginImageContext

888
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,652
for a certain size region.

889
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,188
And then you can just use UIBezierpath draw or

890
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:08,191
get graphics context, whatever, draw in there.

891
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,960
And then there's an EndImageContext.

892
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,396
And it'll capture it and create a little image for you.

893
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,265
So that's another way to do it.

894
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,168
So once you have an image, okay, that you got from any of

895
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,836
these sources, you can just draw it inside your drawRect

896
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,307
by saying draw atPoint or draw inRect.

897
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,878
Or actually, I think that's probably drawAt space point,

898
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,546
not atPoint:.

899
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:35,385
And drawIn space rect and drawAsPatternIn space rect.

900
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,820
Those do kind of what you would think, right?

901
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,023
draw atPoint draws it where that's the upper left hand

902
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,091
corner, it draws it in its natural size.

903
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,694
draw inRect is going to scale it to fit inside

904
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,164
the rectangle that you provide.

905
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,332
And drawAsPattern is gonna tile it.

906
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,067
So presumably that's a small image and

907
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,869
you're drawing a texture or something.

908
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,306
And it's gonna repeat it over and

909
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,342
over to fill the rectangle, okay?

910
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,110
I'll fix this slide and repost it.

911
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,748
Alright, one thing to be careful of with UIView.

912
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,917
When UIView changes size,

913
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:11,587
you do not get asked to redraw by default.

914
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,556
What it does is, believe it or

915
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,293
not, takes what you've drawn, grabs the pixels, and

916
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,229
stretches them to fit the new bounds.

917
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,465
Okay, now, this is often not what you want.

918
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,667
Often, what you want is, okay, if my bounds change,

919
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:28,170
ask me to redraw again in my new bounds, okay?

920
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,039
So how is this controlled?

921
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,042
It's controlled via this var in UIView called contentMode.

922
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,245
And the contentMode can be things like left, right, top,

923
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,014
bottom, topRight, topLeft.

924
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,150
That's basically saying, take my bits and

925
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,618
shove them up into the left corner you know,

926
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,621
one of these spots, center or right.

927
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,656
Don't touch, don't do anything with them,

928
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,123
just move them in the new bounds.

929
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,560
Well, that's likely to cut off what you've drawn or something

930
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,928
like that depending on how much the bounds have changed.

931
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,630
Like when you rotate, you know,

932
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,699
the bounds changes quite a bit.

933
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,334
There's also the scaling ones.

934
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,703
And this is the default, scaleToFill.

935
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,873
And that says, take my bits and take my new bounds and

936
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,241
scale it to fill.

937
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,243
I can preserve the aspect ratio if I want.

938
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,044
Although, again,

939
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,079
that's probably gonna cut something off.

940
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:13,215
But the real one that you want is redraw.

941
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,518
If you set your contentMode to be .redraw,

942
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,221
then when your bounds change, your draw is gonna be

943
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,892
called--your drawRect, draw with the rect argument.

944
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,194
So in your assignment three, you're gonna wanna do this.

945
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,429
You can actually do this,

946
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,264
you can do it in code by setting that var.

947
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,433
But you can also do it in Interface Builder, okay?

948
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,569
In the Utilities window, in the Inspector preview.

949
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,905
Just, I think it's the very top one, contentMode.

950
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,776
All right, so I'm, I'm gonna be leaving the slides here so

951
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,245
I will tell you what's coming up.

952
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,147
I'm gonna do this demo right now where I'm gonna do

953
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,084
a custom view, a FaceView, a UIView that draws a face.

954
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,920
And then Wednesday, I'm gonna talk about gestures.

955
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,055
We'll add some gestures to control our face.

956
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,658
And I'm gonna start talking about multiple MVCs,

957
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,794
I'll finish up with multiple MVCs next week.

958
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,964
Your assignment three requires you to do multiple MVCs, so

959
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,500
I'm not going to make it due until a week from next Monday,

960
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,802
because you'll need next Monday's lecture.

961
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,306
However, I'll probably ship the assignment, the write-up,

962
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,909
on Wednesday, because a big part of that assignment

963
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,478
is drawing your own custom view and you'll certainly know

964
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,080
everything you need to know to do that right off the bat.

965
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,983
So you can kind of get started on the view, and

966
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,418
then next Monday, you can start doing the multiple MVCs.

967
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,354
And you'll still have a full week until the next Monday,

968
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,156
to get that done, alright.

969
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,858
No Friday section this week.

970
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,562
Okay, so as with most demos in this course,

971
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,666
I'm going to start from scratch, okay.

972
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,101
We're going to do a completely new app.

973
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,836
No more calculator in here.

974
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,603
So I could click on here to open my calculator.

975
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:45,508
But instead, I'm gonna go back here to Create a new project.

976
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,576
Okay, it's gonna be Single View Application,

977
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,877
as I told you they all would be.

978
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,747
I'm gonna call this one FaceIt, okay.

979
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,449
And it's gonna start out just drawing a face, but

980
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,184
it's gonna do much more eventually.

981
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,654
And, still no core data or testing stuff yet, so

982
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,790
I'm just gonna do FaceIt here.

983
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,191
It's gonna say where do you want it?

984
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,360
I'm gonna put it in the same place the calculator is,

985
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,094
in my Developer.

986
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,228
I'm not gonna be using SCM.

987
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:06,963
But of course,

988
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,165
those of you come who came to Friday section,

989
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,633
you'll know how to use that.

990
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,603
And here is my new app here.

991
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,538
And I'm also going to do my standard thing,

992
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,706
where I'm gonna take these supporting files and

993
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,841
move them out of our way.

994
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,444
So they don't distract us every time we look at

995
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,513
the Navigator here.

996
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,783
Because we don't need those for this demo.

997
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:32,154
So just like every other thing we've done, we have a view.

998
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,324
Here's our story board with our view.

999
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,393
Oops, not that small.

1000
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,862
And of course, we have our controller.

1001
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,530
And I'm gonna delete this out of the controller,

1002
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,800
as usual here.

1003
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,303
And this time, we're going to start right off here

1004
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,539
by building a custom UIView, custom UIView subclass.

1005
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,274
Now, the way we do that is the saw way we built

1006
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,176
the CalculatorBrain.

1007
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,811
We go here, new file, right.

1008
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,714
That's how we add new files to our project.

1009
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,716
But this time, for

1010
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,985
CalculatorBrain we chose Swift File because it, you know,

1011
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,186
it wasn't a UI thing.

1012
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,288
It didn't inherit from any iOS class.

1013
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,391
But now we're gonna choose Cocoa Touch Class, because

1014
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,461
it's gonna be a subclass of a Cocoa Touch UIKit class.

1015
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,463
So we click that.

1016
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,165
It says, what do you want it to be a subclass of?

1017
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,401
And we want UIView, but you can see there's other things.

1018
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,902
UIViewController, and

1019
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,337
other things that we'll learn later in the quarter.

1020
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,673
But this is a subclass of UIView.

1021
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,607
I'm gonna call it FaceView,

1022
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,177
because it's a view that draws a face.

1023
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,912
Okay, it's a good name.

1024
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,714
Alright, so we click here.

1025
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,382
It says, where do you wanna put it?

1026
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,618
We usually wanna be very careful to put it in the same

1027
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,052
place as everything else is.

1028
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,521
You don't want it in Supporting Files, and

1029
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,422
you don't want it at this top level, the project level.

1030
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,858
You want it inside this folder right here,

1031
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,560
that has all your stuff in it.

1032
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,462
So we'll do that.

1033
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,397
Alright, so here's our FaceView.

1034
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,567
And you can see right off the bat in FaceView, we get this.

1035
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,970
Which is our draw, okay, the draw with the rect.

1036
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,340
Notice that it is commented out.

1037
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,041
And that's because for

1038
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:03,145
performance reasons, iOS doesn't want to ask views that

1039
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,214
don't actually do any drawing, to draw.

1040
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,816
Because it has to keep a backing store for

1041
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,818
them, and there's memory stores and all this stuff.

1042
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,921
So by default this comes commented out.

1043
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,956
But of course, our FaceView is going to draw.

1044
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,458
It's going to draw a face.

1045
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:18,227
So we're going to un-comment it out.

1046
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,331
Okay, now we have a FaceView here,

1047
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,432
it doesn't draw anything.

1048
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,803
But I actually wanna briefly go back to our storyboard, and

1049
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,938
put a FaceView in the storyboard.

1050
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:32,875
And it's really simple but I want to show it to you.

1051
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,976
if we go down to the Object Palette at the bottom here,

1052
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,010
And again,

1053
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,512
where we got our buttons and

1054
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,481
labels, you know I could search here forever.

1055
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,316
There's no FaceView in here.

1056
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:43,252
But I can go down towards the bottom here, and

1057
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,420
you will see this one.

1058
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,023
It's actually almost at the very bottom, it's View.

1059
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,291
See, it represents a rectangular region which draws

1060
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,293
and receives events, as promised.

1061
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,063
And so I can pick this guy up and drag him out.

1062
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:58,568
Okay, and drop him here inside this view controller.

1063
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,402
And remember that the top level view in this view

1064
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,738
controller is a var called view.

1065
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,807
Okay, a very important var.

1066
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:08,010
Now, I want this view to fill the whole space.

1067
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,314
So I'm actually gonna use the blue dash lines to

1068
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,518
make this thing fit the entire space, you see that?

1069
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,988
Now, well, I also want to do the Ctrl-dragging to

1070
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,590
the edges that we did in calculator, remember that?

1071
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,992
But it's actually kind of hard to do this because I want it

1072
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,795
all the way to the edges.

1073
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,131
But since I used the blue lines, I can use a really cool

1074
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,067
feature which is down here, this button.

1075
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,068
You see this button in the lower right here?

1076
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,603
It says Resolve Auto Layout Issues.

1077
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,705
If you click that,

1078
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,942
one of the choices is to Reset to Suggested Constraints.

1079
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,779
So that is the system saying, I'll make your constraints for

1080
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,914
you based on what you did with the blue lines.

1081
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,483
So I'm gonna look at your blue lines.

1082
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,752
Since I used blue lines all at the edges,

1083
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,354
if I say Reset to Suggested Constraints,

1084
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,957
it's gonna hook those things to the edges.

1085
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,592
Because that's what it looked I wanted.

1086
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,128
Now I can double-check what it gave me by clicking here on

1087
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,730
the Size Inspector.

1088
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,998
And if you look down towards the bottom of

1089
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,400
the Size Inspector, you can see all your constraints.

1090
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,536
And look at that, perfect Trailing Space to Superview,

1091
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,738
leading space here.

1092
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,640
Excellent, all exactly what I want.

1093
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,943
So here, I've gotten all my Auto-Layout with one click.

1094
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,412
And that's going to be possible to do quite a bit.

1095
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,846
If you use those blue lines and

1096
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,882
you say Reset to Suggested Constraints,

1097
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,617
often it'll at least get close.

1098
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,987
And then you can kinda tweak the ones it didn't get right.

1099
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,656
Now, the other crucial thing I have to do here

1100
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,559
is that this is currently a UIView.

1101
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,496
If I go over here to this inspector here,

1102
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,299
which is the Identity Inspector, you can see that

1103
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:41,637
the class of the selected thing is UIView.

1104
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,372
So no matter what I put in my draw,

1105
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,406
it would never be called.

1106
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,476
Because this is not a FaceView, it's a UIView.

1107
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,847
But I can just click here, and go down and choose FaceView.

1108
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,518
And now I've made this a FaceView.

1109
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,119
all the code I put in my draw is going to draw in here.

1110
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,653
So now,

1111
00:45:58,723 --> 00:45:59,488
And that's it,

1112
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,158
that's all I need to do to put a custom view into my UI.

1113
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,825
It's very common to want to put a custom view

1114
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,426
in, in the UI.

1115
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,830
So that's why it's so simple to do.

1116
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:11,767
Now all we need to do here is in our FaceView,

1117
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:14,636
write the code that draws--draws our face.

1118
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,538
So what are we gonna do to draw a face?

1119
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,243
Well, I'm just gonna draw the kind of emoji face, this round

1120
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,779
circle for a head, two round eyes, a little smile.

1121
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,614
Okay, a very simple face.

1122
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,584
And, let's start by drawing the skull of our face, the,

1123
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,253
kind of the head of this face.

1124
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,456
And I just start doing that in draw here.

1125
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,758
I'm going to use UIBezierPath to do all this.

1126
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,528
So I don't actually even need to get the context.

1127
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,864
That UI get graphics, get context, don't even do that.

1128
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,499
Just use UIBezierPath automatically

1129
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,833
knows what context you're in.

1130
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,902
So you don't have to do any of that.

1131
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,637
So what do I need to do though?

1132
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,874
I need to kind of think of how big my face is.

1133
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,543
I want my face, if I'm in portrait or landscape, I also

1134
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,613
want my face to kind of be the smaller of the two sides,

1135
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:58,481
the height or the width.

1136
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,248
You know what I mean?

1137
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,451
Because I always want the face to fully fit in there.

1138
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,522
So I'm going to let my skullRadius, so that's gonna

1139
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,559
be the radius of my skull, okay, equal the minimum.

1140
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:11,927
And there's this nice min,

1141
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,129
you see that min function right there?

1142
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,799
It's generic-typed like an array.

1143
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,200
Array of T, so that's the T.

1144
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,368
It will take any type.

1145
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,836
And it will compare two things, and

1146
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,572
return the one that's the lowest.

1147
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,808
So I'm going to get the minimum of my bound,

1148
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,412
bounds.size.width and my bounds.size.height.

1149
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,814
And then I'm going to divide it by 2, because it's radius,

1150
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,915
not diameter.

1151
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,618
So now, see what I'm doing here?

1152
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,954
I'm just making it so that my radius of my skull will be

1153
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,424
smaller of the width or height.

1154
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,392
And then, what about where I want the skull to be?

1155
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:44,860
Well, I want it to be right in the center.

1156
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:51,700
So can I say, let skullCenter equal my center?

1157
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,736
Okay, that's a method, can I say that?

1158
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,838
That's a var, anything wrong with that?

1159
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,241
No, I see shaking heads--why not, what's wrong with that?

1160
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,077
Yeah?

1161
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,483
He says because it'll start from the top left.

1162
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,684
Not quite.

1163
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,419
Anyone else wanna take a stab at this one?

1164
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,558
It's because center, while it is the center of this view,

1165
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,995
it's in the wrong coordinate system.

1166
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,330
This center is in my superview's coordinate system

1167
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,464
and I'm in draw.

1168
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,099
I need to be in my coordinate system.

1169
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,268
So there's actually two things I can do here.

1170
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,804
One I could use this cool function in view called

1171
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,640
convert which will convert a point

1172
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,509
from one coordinate system to another.

1173
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,045
So I can go down to this one okay,

1174
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,481
convert CGPoint from view, and

1175
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,353
I could convert this point center from my superview.

1176
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,423
Okay, so just using center I can convert it.

1177
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,526
That would be fine, because I've converted it from one

1178
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,462
coordinate system, my superviews, to mine.

1179
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,298
That's probably a little,

1180
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,733
someone reading this code is like,

1181
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:59,135
hm, why are they doing that?

1182
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:03,505
A simpler way to do it is probably just to create

1183
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:08,944
a point, a CGPoint, that is my bounds midX, that's my

1184
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:14,850
middle X, see, that's a rect thing, and my bounds midY.

1185
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,453
Okay.

1186
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,687
So I'm just creating the point that is the center,

1187
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:19,854
That makes sense?

1188
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,525
much more straightforwardly there.

1189
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,860
All right, so now I have my radius and the center.

1190
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,494
Now I need to draw a circle.

1191
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:27,629
So how do I draw a circle?

1192
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,865
I'm gonna do that with UIBezierPath.

1193
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:33,002
So I'm gonna say let path equal a UIBezierPath.

1194
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,836
Now, when we look at the constructors for

1195
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:38,807
UIBezierPath here you can see that we can draw an arc.

1196
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,342
Which is actually what I'm going to use.

1197
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,611
We could draw an oval, which would be cool,

1198
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,346
except the argument is a rect, and

1199
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,614
I have the center and the radius.

1200
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,983
So I can't, I don't really want to use oval.

1201
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:48,984
We could draw a rectangle.

1202
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,186
I want a circle, so that's no good.

1203
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,121
Or a rounded rect.

1204
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,355
I actually want the circle,

1205
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,090
not a rectangle of any kind, okay?

1206
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,560
So I'm gonna use this one right here which draws an arc.

1207
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:01,263
It just takes a center point and it draws a sweeping arc.

1208
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,966
And I'm gonna draw this arc all the way around

1209
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:06,101
to make a circle, okay?

1210
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:06,835
So how does that work?

1211
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,070
Here, I'm gonna make some more space.

1212
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,807
All right, so it wants to know the center of the arc.

1213
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,309
Well, that's my skull center, right?

1214
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,478
It wants to know the radius of the arc, well,

1215
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:19,080
that's my skullRadius, this easy.

1216
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,749
It wants to know the start angle.

1217
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,052
So that's the angle that it's gonna start sweeping.

1218
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:24,920
I'm gonna choose 0,

1219
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:30,526
the angle 0 is straight out to your right.

1220
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,861
Okay, so if you're looking at the screen,

1221
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,830
to the right straight across, that's 0.

1222
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,099
And it's in radians,

1223
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,235
how many people know what radians are to measure angle?

1224
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,269
Okay most of you.

1225
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,138
So radians instead of degrees,

1226
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,908
we measure how much we're going up by radians.

1227
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,244
Radians go from zero all the way around to two pi.

1228
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,412
Around the circle.

1229
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:53,949
Start at zero and then it will go around, pi over two,

1230
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,852
pi, you know, then pi is 180 degrees and

1231
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,521
then around to two pi is 360 degrees.

1232
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,191
So it's in radians, so this end angle has to be in radians

1233
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,592
and I wanna go all the way around.

1234
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,761
So it's 2 times pi.

1235
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,163
We know that Double.pi is pi.

1236
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,766
And then clockwise is whether I'm gonna draw the arc around

1237
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,301
clockwise or the other way.

1238
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,336
It doesn't matter because I'm going all the way around to

1239
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,171
get back to the start anyway.

1240
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,706
So I'll just say false.

1241
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,841
There you go, counter-clockwise.

1242
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,110
Now, I got a warning here, an error.

1243
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:22,845
Let's look at that error.

1244
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,147
What does it say, it says the binary operator* (and is

1245
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,485
pointing to this little multiplier right here) cannot

1246
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,121
be applied to 'Int' and 'Double'.

1247
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,489
Why is it saying that?

1248
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,759
These arguments to UIBezierPath,

1249
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,428
the floating point arguments like a startAngle and

1250
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:42,531
endAngle, what type do you think it's supposed to be?

1251
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,803
No one?

1252
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,472
I hear it being whispered, yes, CGFloat.

1253
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,541
All drawing has to be CGFloat.

1254
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,011
So is Double.pi, is that a CG float?

1255
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,045
No, it's a double.

1256
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,214
Is two a CGFloat?

1257
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,382
Well it might be.

1258
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,784
But Swift would have to infer that it's a CGFloat.

1259
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,187
And right now Swift is confused about what that's

1260
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,122
supposed to be because it knows this argument is

1261
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,724
supposed to be a CGFloat, but

1262
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,425
the thing you're multiplying it by is a Double.

1263
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,628
So Swift doesn't know what to infer here.

1264
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:15,264
Doesn't know whether to refer that to as a Double or

1265
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,265
a CGFloat.

1266
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,302
So the fix here, luckily, CGFloat has a pi.

1267
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,439
Just like double does.

1268
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,308
Now, everybody's happy, because Swift knows how to

1269
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,745
interpret this literal as a CGFloat.

1270
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,247
And this argument to the endAngle is now a CGFloat.

1271
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,114
So now everybody's happy.

1272
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,151
It's only complained that we don't use path yet.

1273
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,519
Okay?

1274
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,554
Excellent, so now we got this arc going all around.

1275
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,558
Let's set something about the path like it's line width for

1276
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,193
example, we'll set a nice, fairly thick line,

1277
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,330
five points wide, that's what that means,

1278
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,432
five point zero, five points wide.

1279
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,334
And then let's set the color.

1280
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:56,171
So I'm gonna get UIColor, let's say, blue color and

1281
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,743
we'll say set, and by the way there's setFill and setStroke.

1282
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,110
There's also just set.

1283
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,346
Set sets both the fill and the stroke.

1284
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,482
Here we only need to set the stroke color, but

1285
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,351
I'll just say set so that you learn about that one.

1286
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,521
And now I can just say path stroke okay and

1287
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,924
it's going to stroke that path.

1288
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,025
So let's see what this looks like.

1289
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,495
Let's go do iPhone 7 here.

1290
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,600
So hopefully this is gonna draw our skull.

1291
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,145
There we go, a skull.

1292
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,647
Whoo, first time, excellent.

1293
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,083
Okay, now I don't like the look of that very

1294
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,419
much because it goes all the way to the edges and

1295
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,555
with a thick line that's actually cut off a little bit.

1296
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,057
So I want to move that in a little bit so we'll do that.

1297
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:51,794
Let's rotate and go from portrait to landscape.

1298
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,032
Not good, not good.

1299
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,734
Okay, why is that happening?

1300
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,234
That it's doing that.

1301
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,401
Well, that's that content

1302
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,904
mode thing I was talking about, right?

1303
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,307
It's not calling my draw when it goes to this other

1304
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,113
bound size right there, so it's just scaling the bits.

1305
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,547
So let's fix both of those things,

1306
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,784
let's make it go in a little bit, and let's fix those bits.

1307
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,887
To fix the bits, we're just gonna go back to our

1308
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,024
storyboard, and click on our view right here.

1309
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,459
Lets get rid of this.

1310
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:28,029
Okay, click on our View, and go over to Utilities.

1311
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,866
Inspect this with the Attributes Inspector and look,

1312
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,603
the very first one, Content Mode, Scales to Fill.

1313
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,605
Every time the bounds change it's scales to bits to fill

1314
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,375
and we want Redraw.

1315
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,777
We could also probably use Center, but

1316
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,280
I actually want Redraw because if my bounds got smaller for

1317
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,148
example, I'd wanna draw my face smaller.

1318
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,951
I wouldn't want to get cut off.

1319
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,052
Okay, so there's Redraw.

1320
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,588
That fixed that one, that was easy to fix.

1321
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,725
What about making this thing kinda smaller?

1322
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:02,631
To do that, I'm actually gonna create a var called scale.

1323
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,268
And it's a drawing thing so it's a CGFloat.

1324
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,871
And I'm going to set it to let's say 0.9 and

1325
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,406
that's going to mean 90%.

1326
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,574
All I'm going to do is take my radius and

1327
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,777
multiply it by that scale.

1328
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,780
So by multiplying my radius by 0.9 or

1329
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:21,450
90% it should zoom move it in a little bit right.

1330
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,585
Kind of in from the edges by 90%.

1331
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:29,358
So let's see if both those things got fixed.

1332
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:34,929
So the 90% worked.

1333
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:40,235
Clearly, it's in 90% and the rotation works also.

1334
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,204
So we're off to a good start here,

1335
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,405
things seem to be working just fine.

1336
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,974
Alright, so, what's the next thing we wanna do?

1337
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,943
Well, we wanna draw eyes and

1338
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,579
a mouth and things like that, I wanna start thinking

1339
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,814
a little bit about my internal architecture.

1340
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,817
And I'm kinda liking the idea of having some private funcs,

1341
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:58,454
like give me the path for the skull.

1342
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:04,526
And have that return a UIBezierPath that

1343
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,562
I can then stroke.

1344
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,130
And then I'll have the same thing, give me the path for

1345
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,464
the eye, give me a path for

1346
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,398
the mouth, you see what I mean?

1347
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,466
I'll get all these.

1348
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,436
And so I can just take this code down here

1349
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,505
that creates this path for the skull and

1350
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,941
I'll just put it up here and I'll just return this path.

1351
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,412
And then, down here, instead of saying paths.stroke,

1352
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,883
I'll say pathForSkull().stroke().

1353
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,784
Do you see that?

1354
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,087
Now, another thing is the skullRadius and

1355
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,756
the skullCenter, I want all the other things like the eyes

1356
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,059
and the mouth to all be relative to that.

1357
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,462
So if I make my skull small I need the eyes to get smaller,

1358
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,730
the mouth to get smaller, everything to move in.

1359
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,232
So I'm gonna use these two guys,

1360
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,801
I'm gonna make them instead of being local variables in draw,

1361
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:51,707
I'm gonna move them out and make them be private vars.

1362
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,410
And in specific they're gonna be private computed vars.

1363
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,346
So I'm just gonna take what they were before and

1364
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,516
I'm just gonna return them so that no matter what my

1365
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,386
bounds is, at any given time, skullRadius,

1366
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,989
that var--which of course we have to type, so CGFloat--that

1367
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,459
skullRadius is always going to match by bounds, okay?

1368
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,794
Because every time I ask for it,

1369
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,396
I'm gonna recompute it using this little function.

1370
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,631
And same thing with skullCenter,

1371
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,133
I'm gonna say private var skullCenter,

1372
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,037
which is also a CGFloat, no this one is a CG point, and

1373
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,807
it's going to be computed.

1374
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,010
Now, one thing you noticed here,

1375
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,746
I don't remember if I covered this in the other lecture but

1376
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,549
you notice, I'm not saying get here.

1377
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,818
See, I'm not putting get and set.

1378
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,554
Well, I'm not putting set because you can't set

1379
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,955
the skull center.

1380
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,458
Skull center is always the center of my bounds so

1381
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,559
I can't set it.

1382
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,662
And then if you have only a get,

1383
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,363
turns out you don't need the get.

1384
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:50,198
Because it's kinda redundant.

1385
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:54,202
So you get this kinda nicer looking code here.

1386
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:55,604
So now we have skullRadius and

1387
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,006
skullCenter available to all of our methods.

1388
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,675
And so all our other paths, like path for eye and

1389
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,443
all that stuff can use them.

1390
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,311
So let's get started on those.

1391
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,714
Let's do path for eye, how about that.

1392
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,916
So in a private func, pathForEye.

1393
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,852
Now actually, probably the path for the eye

1394
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:13,287
is almost the same for the left eye and the right eye.

1395
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:17,125
So I'm gonna create a little type here called Eye which

1396
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,428
is just gonna be a little enum.

1397
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,601
And it's gonna just be the left and right eye, so

1398
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,537
private enum Eye.

1399
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:35,844
Let's see Eye is case left case right, okay.

1400
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,713
So I mean it's perfectly fine to use an enum

1401
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,549
just to represent something simple like this.

1402
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,451
You don't have to always be doing methods and

1403
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,419
associated values.

1404
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:45,820
We don't have any associated values here.

1405
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,057
We're just representing it as a way to specify in this API,

1406
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:54,228
which eye we want the path, the UIBezierPath, for.

1407
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,766
So, by the way, also I wanna have some constants

1408
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,069
that tell me where the eye is relative to the center and

1409
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,038
where the mouth is and how big the eyes are.

1410
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,075
So to save a little bit of time here, I'm going to just

1411
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,913
type those in at the bottom here real quick.

1412
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,581
Look how fast I typed them in.

1413
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,716
This is, by the way, how we do

1414
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:20,188
constants in swift we just create a struct and we make

1415
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:25,193
static lets on it which are all of our constants and

1416
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,463
what's really cool about this, one it groups them together.

1417
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,697
Like here I have Ratios,

1418
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:33,634
it's all the ratios between the skull radius and all these

1419
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,271
things I want to do like the eye offset and the mouth.

1420
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,473
Also it types them.

1421
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,608
You see these are typed constants.

1422
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,811
I can put the type in there, because they're just vars,

1423
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,580
they're static vars on this struct.

1424
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:46,948
Okay. We don't have any storage

1425
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:47,481
in this struct.

1426
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,483
Doesn't have any methods.

1427
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,318
It just is only used for constants here.

1428
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:54,523
Now, I'm gonna use these constants down here, and

1429
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,191
I'm gonna use the skull radius and

1430
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,360
center up here to calculate the path for the eye.

1431
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,295
So how am I gonna do that?

1432
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,331
First I need the center of the eye.

1433
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,901
Now, I'm gonna create a function to calculate

1434
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,902
the center of the eye.

1435
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,337
But I only need it for pathForEye.

1436
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:13,108
So I'm actually gonna put it inside pathForEye.

1437
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,277
So I'm gonna create a function here, centerOfEye.

1438
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,746
Just gonna type it in quick here to save some time.

1439
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,015
I'll go through it though.

1440
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,051
And centerOfEye, look how it's inside pathForEye.

1441
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,954
And that's perfectly legal, some of you are probably using

1442
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:27,855
that strategy in your assignment two.

1443
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,225
I think I mentioned it in a hint, that you can do it.

1444
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,160
And all it does is, it keeps centerOfEye inside here,

1445
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,729
because it's not needed anywhere else.

1446
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,564
So now, readers of my code don't have to worry about this

1447
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,899
thing being called somewhere else, and

1448
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,267
what it's semantics might be out there.

1449
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:41,702
They already know that it's only used in this nice,

1450
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,239
little space right here, so it's kind of a nice way to

1451
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,842
arrange your code to make it a little more readable.

1452
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:49,510
So how does centerOfEye work?

1453
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,279
Well it takes the eye, and

1454
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:54,782
it just gets the eye offset by taking the skull radius and

1455
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,584
dividing it by one of those constants,

1456
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,287
the ratio between the skull radius to the eye offset,

1457
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,322
that's how much it's gonna offset the eye.

1458
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,991
Now I'm gonna offset the eye the same amount up as I do

1459
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,726
to the sides.

1460
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:09,230
So the line between the nose of our face, and

1461
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,332
the two eyes is gonna be equilateral triangles, or no,

1462
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,134
not quite equilaterals.

1463
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:13,935
It can be a little wider, but

1464
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:19,040
the same distance going up as it is going out to the sides.

1465
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,709
I'm gonna start with the eyeCenter being in the center.

1466
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,310
And then,

1467
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,145
I'm starting with the eye in the center of the face, and

1468
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,080
then I'm gonna move it up and over.

1469
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,515
Okay. So here I'm moving it up.

1470
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:30,352
Notice that up is minus the eye offset,

1471
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,222
because decreasing y is up, increasing y is down.

1472
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:38,793
And for x, I'm going to add the eye offset or

1473
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,129
subtract the eye offset,

1474
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,164
depending on whether it's the left eye or the right eye.

1475
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:46,234
So for the left eye, I'm going to subtract the eye offset.

1476
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:48,437
And for the right eye, I'm going to add the eye offset.

1477
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:50,371
Okay?

1478
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,773
Everyone understand that little

1479
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:52,974
construct right there, I hope.

1480
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,343
Okay and then it's returning the center.

1481
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,044
So now I have the center of the eye.

1482
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,880
So using the center of the eye,

1483
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:02,084
I can say let the eye radius equal the skull radius

1484
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:10,024
divided by the ratio for that one,

1485
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:16,364
which is skullRadiusToEyeRadius.

1486
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,766
Okay, so that's what I'm gonna do.

1487
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,469
And I'm gonna let the eyeCenter just

1488
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,137
equal centerOfEye, whichever eye.

1489
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,306
The eye that's up here.

1490
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,510
So I'm just calling this little function right here.

1491
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:33,681
And so I have those two things.

1492
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,583
So I can just create another circle.

1493
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:39,087
So I'm going to let path equal UIBezierPath and

1494
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,555
do that arc again.

1495
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,190
Here the center is the eye center.

1496
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,492
And the radius is the eye radius.

1497
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,461
And the start angle is still zero.

1498
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,530
Then end angle is still CGFloat.pi* 2, and clockwise,

1499
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,264
it doesn't matter.

1500
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,400
I'll go the other way this time.

1501
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,769
Okay, so there's my path.

1502
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,439
Let's set path.lineWidth equal 5.0 again.

1503
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,341
Starting to get tired of typing that.

1504
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,876
It's probably not a good thing.

1505
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,145
And then let's return the path.

1506
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,013
Okay. So that's it.

1507
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,949
So that gets the path for either the left eye or

1508
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:11,052
the right eye.

1509
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,356
we'll say pathForEye, the left eye, stroke.

1510
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,561
Okay, pathForEye, the right eye, stroke.

1511
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,964
Okay, I hope everyone's comfortable with the fact that

1512
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,866
I'm calling a method, taking this return value, and

1513
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,201
immediately sending it a message.

1514
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,271
So, let's see how this went.

1515
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,239
Let's see if we got this right.

1516
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,348
Look at that.

1517
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,415
FIrst time.

1518
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,884
It's really going well today.

1519
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:45,186
Okay, so there's our two lines, they look good.

1520
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,621
You know what would be kind of cool though?

1521
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,957
If we could have open eyes and closed eyes.

1522
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,760
So how could we, how could we have open eyes and

1523
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,229
How about this: let's go up here and just like we had this

1524
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,630
closed eyes?

1525
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,633
var scale which by the way notice I left the var public.

1526
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,568
Scale, so that people who are using my face view,

1527
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,236
they can control the size of the face.

1528
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,505
I don't mind.

1529
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,107
And, I'm also gonna have eyes open, which is going to be

1530
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,409
a bool, which will start out being false.

1531
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,344
And we're just gonna make our pathForEye,

1532
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,314
look at this var, look at the value of this var.

1533
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,583
And either have the eyes open or closed.

1534
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,052
So, I'm back here in path for eye.

1535
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,322
So, if the eyes are open then we're just gonna do what we

1536
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,925
were already doing here, this business.

1537
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:26,027
Okay, because that's what we did so far.

1538
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:27,962
But if the eyes are closed,

1539
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,497
then I want the path to be different.

1540
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,099
So, watch what I'm gonna do here.

1541
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:37,172
Let path be a UIBezierPath without a value to start.

1542
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:42,744
Okay, and then I set it here, and I'm gonna set it here, and

1543
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,212
that's allowed.

1544
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:46,147
In other words Swift is smart enough to know,

1545
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,417
you created a let, which can only be initialized once.

1546
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,019
But you conditionally initialized it here,

1547
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,356
because now I'm gonna say path equals.

1548
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:56,257
And for the closed case I'm just gonna make

1549
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,793
a bezier path that starts out blank.

1550
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,662
And then I'm gonna just move to, line to,

1551
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,032
to make a little horizontal line for a closed eye.

1552
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,435
So, I'm gonna say path.move(to: ) to move to

1553
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:12,974
a point, CGPoint, we use this constructor right here.

1554
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:18,512
Not that one, let's use, this one, CGFloat.

1555
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,548
And the point we're gonna move to we're gonna move to

1556
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:24,652
the eyeCenter x minus the eyeRadius.

1557
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,087
So, we're gonna move to the center of the eye and

1558
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:29,023
back up with the eye there.

1559
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,092
And we're gonna be at the eyeCenter.y.

1560
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,994
So, we're gonna right in the eyeCenter and

1561
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:34,229
we're gonna draw a horizontal line so

1562
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:36,664
we're gonna move to the left side of it.

1563
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:41,303
And then we're going to add a line to the right side.

1564
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:47,008
So, another CGPoint which is this one again.

1565
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,543
And this one is going to be the eyeCenter.x

1566
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,779
plus the eyeRadius.

1567
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:56,184
And it's still at the eyeCenter, okay?

1568
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,685
Make sense?

1569
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:59,087
Two more parentheses in there.

1570
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,089
Everyone see what I did there?

1571
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,758
But I just wanna make sure you understood this

1572
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:04,759
thing of let path.

1573
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,129
You don't have to say equals here as long as this if then

1574
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:12,867
still only initializes it once and doesn't change it.

1575
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,135
Because it's still a valid let.

1576
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,305
So, let's go take a look at that.

1577
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:26,815
Okay, eyes closed.

1578
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,148
Excellent, okay?

1579
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,350
They're closed eyes.

1580
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,386
We can go back here, set this to true.

1581
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,522
And again, we should get open eyes.

1582
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,158
Questions?

1583
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,894
So, the question is when do people do a custom

1584
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,931
view like this when they draw off their own thing?

1585
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,900
In other words, when they don't use this built in things

1586
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,502
like button and things like that well it depends on

1587
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,471
the content that they are providing.

1588
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,107
But a lot of times, maybe they are not drawing with arcs and

1589
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,277
circles, maybe they're drawing with images and text okay?

1590
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,380
They're laying how they want down to a level or

1591
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,349
in an orientation that those can do or maybe they're doing

1592
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,553
text along a curve, which you can do with this for example.

1593
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,721
So, it's that kind of thing.

1594
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,456
You might not see raw drawing like this.

1595
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,091
We're doing raw drawing because it's simple and

1596
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,328
I'm trying to show you how you do it.

1597
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,796
But there are apps that are drawing

1598
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,530
apps where you can take your finger and draw.

1599
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,799
They would clearly do this as well right,

1600
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,868
some of you might do that as your final project.

1601
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:23,138
Okay, so anyway there's our eye.

1602
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,873
So, we've got our eyes going, we've got our skull.

1603
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:26,607
How about our mouth?

1604
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,409
We've gotta get the mouth going so let's go do that.

1605
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,144
And we're gonna do the same thing there.

1606
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:34,882
I'm gonna have a private func pathForMouth and

1607
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:38,453
it's gonna be a UIBezierPath.

1608
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,154
So, how I'm going to do the mouth.

1609
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,956
Actually, I'm going to start by drawing the mouth as

1610
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:42,991
a rectangle,

1611
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,426
just to show you where I'm gonna put it on screen.

1612
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,795
And then we'll turn it, we'll use a bezier curve,

1613
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,130
actually, to make the mouth.

1614
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,832
So, how am I going to do that?

1615
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,468
First, I'm going to calculate

1616
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:57,638
some things like the width of the mouth, the height of

1617
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,307
the mouth, and the offset of the mouth--the offset down

1618
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:03,411
from the middle of the face--using more of these

1619
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,980
ratios.

1620
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,214
So, I'm just calculating the mouth, width,

1621
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,350
height, and offset.

1622
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,619
Now, I'm gonna use that to create the rectangle in which

1623
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,354
I'm going to put the mouth.

1624
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:18,993
Let's do that, let mouthRect equal and so the mouthRect

1625
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,462
is gotta be offset down by the mouth offset.

1626
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,831
And it's gonna be the width and height, so let's do that.

1627
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:28,602
So, CGRect we'll use this constructor right here,

1628
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,573
CGFloat, we'll do the skull's center dot x

1629
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:36,511
minus the mouth's width, divided by two.

1630
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,514
So that's, because we obviously want the mouth

1631
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,450
centered in there, and then for y,

1632
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:46,354
we'll use the skullCenter.y plus the mouthOffset.

1633
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,389
And again it's plus,

1634
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:52,093
because plus is down in our drawing system.

1635
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:57,932
And the width is just the mouthWidth and

1636
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,368
the height is the mouthHeight.

1637
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:04,005
Let me make this a little easier to read like this.

1638
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,414
Everyone understand what I'm

1639
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,948
doing there with the mouse rect?

1640
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,383
Let's just draw this rect.

1641
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,720
So, I can say let path equal UIBezierPath.

1642
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,355
BezierPath knows how do a rect.

1643
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:23,724
It's this one down here.

1644
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:29,531
The rect is our mouthRect and let's just return that path.

1645
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,433
So, now we've got a path for the mouth.

1646
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,102
Let's go down here and

1647
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,139
stroke it by saying pathForMouth().stroke().

1648
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,909
Let's see what this looks like.

1649
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,917
Okay, excellent.

1650
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,352
So, we have a mouth.

1651
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:53,721
Kinda looks like a robot face.

1652
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,024
We want it to have a nice curve, a smile or a frown.

1653
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,527
So, we gotta start thinking a little bit how we're gonna

1654
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:03,297
represent whether this is smiling or frowning.

1655
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:07,669
And so I'm gonna introduce another var, up at the top,

1656
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,736
here, just like I have it with the eyes are open.

1657
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:15,109
I'm gonna have a var which I'm gonna call mouthCurvature and

1658
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:17,445
make it be a Double.

1659
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,015
I'll set it to, let's say 1.0 and

1660
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:25,553
the semantics of this I'm going to have it be that

1661
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:30,491
1.0 is full smile and minus 1.0 is full frown.

1662
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,093
And this is going to be public and this is going to be

1663
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,963
the public API that someone uses when they want to use my

1664
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:39,299
FaceView to tell me how much this mouth should be smiling.

1665
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,836
Okay, the mouth curvature right here.

1666
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,270
And I've just defined it this way.

1667
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,073
It's public, I've documented it.

1668
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:48,242
And so people can set it to whatever they want.

1669
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,043
So I'm going to use this now to do it.

1670
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,713
Now one thing is I've defined it as a double because,

1671
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,983
you know I'm not actually doing the drawing right now

1672
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,152
I'm just talking conceptually what curvature is.

1673
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,722
So, I need to convert this in the some meaningful CGFloat,

1674
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,824
and then use that to draw this mouth.

1675
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,459
So, how am I gonna do that?

1676
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:08,562
The way I'm gonna do that do that is let's get this back up

1677
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,033
here and I'll show you, on the rectangle that we have here.

1678
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,803
I'm gonna use what's called a Bezier curve,

1679
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,639
how many people know what is Bezier curve is?

1680
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,474
Only one person!

1681
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:23,777
My Gosh, okay so a Bezier curve is just

1682
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,114
two end points a line between two end points but

1683
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:30,050
there are two other points called control points.

1684
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,518
And you can kinda think it as,

1685
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,188
think of it as the line starts out at the start,

1686
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,957
starts heading for one of the control points.

1687
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,693
As it gets close, it starts heading for the other one.

1688
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,395
And as it gets close to that one, it starts heading for

1689
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,596
the end, okay.

1690
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,032
So, the control points kind of pull on the line and

1691
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,234
give it some curve.

1692
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,335
And you can put those control points anywhere you want.

1693
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,571
Obviously, we're gonna put ours like this.

1694
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,774
So, my start is gonna be right here in the middle of this

1695
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:56,110
line and my end is gonna be right here.

1696
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:58,378
So we're gonna draw a line across here.

1697
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,047
And my two control points are going to

1698
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,752
be down here somewhere, on both sides of his chin.

1699
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,087
the line is gonna start here, start down towards this one.

1700
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,354
And so

1701
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:08,322
Whoop. Starting going to

1702
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:09,090
the other one.

1703
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,192
Whoop. Come back up here. And make a little smile.

1704
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:14,228
And if I move my control points up to

1705
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:15,129
the top, then whoop.

1706
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:15,897
It'll be a frown.

1707
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,033
Everyone understand that.

1708
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:19,967
So I need four points.

1709
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,702
The start, the end, and the two control points.

1710
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:22,570
Let's do those.

1711
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,973
The start is easy,

1712
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,442
that's just the middle of the left edge, okay.

1713
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,912
So I can say the start is CGPoint.

1714
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:36,116
And again we'll do this kind of CGPoint.

1715
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:41,655
And it's going to be the mouth rect, our little mouth rect,

1716
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:46,193
MinX, that's the left edge, the minimum X, and

1717
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:51,499
mouthRect.midY, that's halfway up the mouth rect.

1718
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:55,136
And the end is going to be CGPoint.

1719
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,871
This float.

1720
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,575
And this one's gonna be the mouthrect.maxX and

1721
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:03,377
mouthrect.midY on the other side.

1722
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:04,712
So the two ends, start and end,

1723
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,981
are right in the middle of my mouth rect on either side.

1724
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,483
So now I need those two control points.

1725
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,519
For the control points I need to think of how far down

1726
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,887
they're going to be.

1727
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,190
And it depends on the mouth curvature.

1728
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,059
The more smile I want, the farther down they need to be.

1729
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,929
The more frown I want, the farther up they need to be.

1730
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:25,666
So I'm gonna create another thing called smileOffset.

1731
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,703
And this is gonna be a CGFloat, because it's gonna be

1732
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,173
something that I'm using to do drawing here.

1733
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:38,512
And I'm gonna make it equal to the mouthCurvature,

1734
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:44,718
which is a double, times the mouth rect.height.

1735
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,988
So I will move down those control points all the way

1736
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:51,959
the entire height of a mouth rect if I'm fully smiling.

1737
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:54,261
Now, there's some problems with this line of code.

1738
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,563
One is, if you look at these things right here,

1739
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,300
it's saying you can't multiply a Double times a Float.

1740
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,536
This is a float, this is a double.

1741
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,238
So I'm gonna have to convert this to a float

1742
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,008
by using a constructor for CGFloat.

1743
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:10,077
Luckily, it has one that takes a double okay.

1744
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,914
Another thing here is smile offset has to be between,

1745
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:15,249
you know, one, or sorry,

1746
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:18,485
mouth curvature here has to be between one and minus one.

1747
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,020
So I'm gonna enforce that.

1748
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,789
Because I wouldn't want this path curvature to be five, and

1749
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:23,891
now he's smiling so

1750
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,160
big that it's, you know, on the floor literally.

1751
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,960
Jaws on the floor.

1752
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:27,795
We don't want that.

1753
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,664
So I'm going to use min and max to do that.

1754
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:33,067
I'm gonna say max minus one of min

1755
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:36,236
of the mouth curvature and one.

1756
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,972
And that's going to restrict it to be between minus one

1757
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:39,774
and one.

1758
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,143
Everybody got that.

1759
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:46,047
I'm just using min and max to do that there.

1760
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,549
And notice that it's automatically

1761
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,584
made these be doubles, which is fine.

1762
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,087
So the result of min and max is double, and

1763
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,789
that's being converted to a CGFloat.

1764
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:55,656
That works fine.

1765
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,993
Okay, so now that I have that smile offset,

1766
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,961
I can say how far down my control points are.

1767
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,465
So I'm gonna let cp1, which is control point one, it's gonna

1768
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,402
be smile offset times the mouth rect height down.

1769
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,871
And I'm gonna make the two control points be

1770
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:14,242
one third of the way in from the edges of the mouth rect.

1771
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:16,977
Does that make sense?

1772
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,513
We wanted to kinda head down, we wanted to kinda

1773
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,982
be one-third of the way along from each side.

1774
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,583
So cp1 is gonna be on the left.

1775
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:27,188
That's gonna be a CGPoint.

1776
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,189
And this again.

1777
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:35,196
And so this one will be the start.x.

1778
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,364
Start is where we're starting right here.

1779
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,434
Plus the mouthRect.width divided by three.

1780
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:42,637
So I'm going a third of the way across.

1781
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:47,441
And then the y is a start.y plus the smile offset

1782
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:50,211
which could be negative if mouth curvature is negative.

1783
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,246
Smile offset might be negative, meaning going up.

1784
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:53,881
And so, this will be a frown.

1785
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:56,116
Or it could be positive and then it will go down.

1786
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:59,786
Then cp2 is almost exactly the same so I'll copy and

1787
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,288
paste it, cp2.

1788
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:04,858
It's just that here we're gonna go to the end and

1789
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:08,295
move back by mouthRect.width.

1790
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:11,732
But it's still it's at the same level okay because we

1791
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:15,002
want it to come down, go across, and then come back up.

1792
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,704
So now that we have these control points and

1793
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,973
the start and the end, now we can draw that in the path.

1794
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,842
So we'll just do go our Bézier path right here.

1795
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,479
We'll leave the rect in there at first so we can see it.

1796
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:31,285
And I'm just gonna tell the path to move to a CGPoint,

1797
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:35,155
which is the start and, actually,

1798
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:38,658
you don't even need to do that.

1799
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,328
You just say, move to the start.

1800
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:45,098
And then, we're gonna draw a curve, addCurve,

1801
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:47,901
which adds one of the Bezier curves.

1802
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,736
And we're going to the end.

1803
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:54,341
And the control point is cp1, and the other is cp2.

1804
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:54,976
So let's take a look.

1805
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,820
Alright, excellent, so we have mouth curvature is 1.0,

1806
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:08,722
we've got a nice big old smile.

1807
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,891
Okay, we don't really want this square there anymore,

1808
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,127
rectangle, so we'll get rid of that.

1809
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,763
We can just do that by creating an empty Bezier

1810
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,931
curve to start.

1811
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:21,502
Also, we want the path's lineWidth to be 5.0.

1812
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,704
One nice, even amount.

1813
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:25,606
And let's go ahead and check some other things.

1814
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:28,375
Let's see if the mouth of minus 0.5.

1815
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,912
Let's see if that gives us a slight frown.

1816
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,447
Should give us a slight frown, right.

1817
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,690
Neat, okay.

1818
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,392
Alright, what's the last thing I'm gonna show.

1819
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,094
One thing that's a little bit of a pain is

1820
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,296
every time I wanna check the mouthCurvature,

1821
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,698
I gotta go run the app.

1822
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,299
Back, change it, run.

1823
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,934
Or every time eyes open, eyes closed.

1824
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,204
Back and forth.

1825
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:00,007
in Interface Builder, okay?

1826
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,141
I can see a button

1827
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,976
when I change it's things in Interface Builder.

1828
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,013
And wouldn't it even be cooler if I could have an inspector

1829
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:06,947
in Interface Builder,

1830
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,382
that would let me inspect these things.

1831
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,584
Well, of course we can do that.

1832
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,753
How do we do that.

1833
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:16,357
We go up here, and we just make this IBDesignable, okay.

1834
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:21,428
If you put IBDesignable in front of a UIView at the top,

1835
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:26,400
then when you go over to your storyboard, at the top, you're

1836
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,703
gonna see it here, compiling that code, integrating it into

1837
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:32,639
Interface Builder, and showing it to you.

1838
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,809
Okay now unfortunately we don't have an inspector here

1839
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,778
that allows us to inspect those things.

1840
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:39,346
But we can do that as well.

1841
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,514
Go back to FaceView here.

1842
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,715
And I'm going to say for

1843
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:45,352
example make the scale IBInspectable.

1844
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:51,525
Let's make eyesOpen IBInspectable.

1845
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:56,030
Let's make the mouthCurvature IBInspectable.

1846
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,831
Let's add a few other things here.

1847
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,601
Let's make the lineWidth IB inspectable.

1848
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,703
So to do that, we can't have this 5.0 going on over here,

1849
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,572
we're gonna have to add a var.

1850
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:10,677
So we're just gonna add an IBInspectable var.

1851
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,513
Which is gonna be the line width, which is a CGFloat.

1852
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,784
We'll start it out at 5.0 but we'll be able to change it.

1853
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,420
So now we can go everywhere where we have that 5.0.

1854
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,557
We'll just change it to use this var.

1855
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,728
We can also do the color.

1856
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:32,065
IBInspectable var the color, it's a UI color.

1857
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:36,003
Okay, we'll start it out as blue like it is now.

1858
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,771
So where we have view UIColor.blue,

1859
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,539
we'll use this var instead.

1860
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,741
Alright, we'll give you a color blue.

1861
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,911
I'm just gonna say color, to set the color.

1862
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,847
Okay, so basically it's taking all the things in my app and

1863
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,383
just making them not only configurable,

1864
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,653
as public variables, but also inspectable.

1865
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,089
So let's go back to our story board and see if this works.

1866
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,191
Sure enough, right away, you see up at the top there,

1867
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,696
Face View, the scale, whether the eyes are open, line width,

1868
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,132
the color, mouth curvature, are now inspectable.

1869
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:07,901
So let's close the eyes.

1870
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:12,606
Let's have the mouth curvature be 0.5.

1871
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:16,176
Let's make the color be orange.

1872
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,712
Let's make the line width be two.

1873
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:22,115
Let's make the scale be 0.5.

1874
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:26,252
Make the scale be 0.9 again, whatever.

1875
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,422
Now another interesting thing about this is just like if you

1876
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,458
were inspecting a UIButton here.

1877
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:34,194
When you run it's going to use

1878
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,664
these settings as the initial settings.

1879
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,299
You truly are editing this,

1880
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,167
just like you would edit anything else,

1881
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,771
any other custom view, see it comes up like this.

1882
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:46,673
Got it?

1883
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:49,242
Now one thing that you have to do when you have

1884
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:54,414
an IBInspectable is you have to explicitly type you cannot

1885
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:55,816
let Swift infer it.

1886
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:59,386
Because while Swift can infer, Interface builder cannot.

1887
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,023
It doesn't have an inference engine there.

1888
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,925
So always make sure you put the actual type

1889
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:10,029
in all the IBInspectables.

1890
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,965
Alright, that's it!

1891
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,367
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a model to our MVC.

1892
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,701
Next time,

1893
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,770
And we're gonna start putting some gestures in here.

1894
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:20,707
And then we'll start talking about multiple MVCs.
