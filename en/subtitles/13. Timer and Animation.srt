00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,675
>> Okay, well,                  
welcome to Stanford CS193P,     

4
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:16,346
Developing Applications for     
iOS, Winter 2017,               

5
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,915
this is lecture number 13.      

6
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:23,253
And this week's topic is        
gonna be animation, and         

7
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:27,290
I'm gonna talk first            
today about timers.             

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,426
Timer is just a way to          
execute a block of code,        

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:33,028
some periodic amount of time.   

10
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:35,830
We don't really use timers for  
animation per se,               

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,167
but often, when we're doing     
something that's animated,      

12
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:41,168
we'll have some                 
timers involved.                

13
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:44,038
And you'll see that especially  
on Wednesday's big demo,        

14
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:47,675
how we're gonna use the timer   
in with our animation tools.    

15
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:49,609
Then after we talk              
about timer, I,                 

16
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:53,146
I do a demo there, we're gonna  
dive into animation proper.     

17
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:56,216
And I'm gonna talk about        
all the different kinds of      

18
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,619
animation mechanisms there      
are and then dive into,         

19
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:02,421
a couple of them with a bit     
of a demo in between.           

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,357
And then on Wednesday, I'll do  
a demo of the last animation    

21
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,359
style, that I'm gonna cover.    

22
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:12,930
So timer, timer is this,        
very simple class,              

23
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,830
very simple to use.             

24
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,732
You're only probably            
gonna use two or                

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:19,035
maybe three, methods or         
vars in it ever.                

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,604
And all it allows you to        
do is take a closure,           

27
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,674
a block of code, and execute    
it some time in the future,     

28
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:28,476
either once or repeatedly,      
in the future.                  

29
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:33,715
And, this is kind of not        
really real-time programming.   

30
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,484
This timer's not gonna go off   
exactly when you say, but       

31
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:39,154
it's gonna be pretty close      
because it's going off on       

32
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:39,987
the main queue.                 

33
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,789
And the main queue              
is sometimes is busy            

34
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,024
handling an event or            
something like that.            

35
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,024
So it's not exact, but          

36
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:46,859
it's pretty darn close,         
to going off.                   

37
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:49,862
So you can't use it for real    
time programming, but you can,  

38
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,465
use it to have any kind of      
repeating thing going on.       

39
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:55,900
Now, timer is based             
on a technology,                

40
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,103
which I'm not gonna talk        
about called run loops.         

41
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:02,941
And run loops are how, you      
know, a certain thread gets     

42
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,111
all this information, like      
events from the, touch screen   

43
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,148
and, or, you know, events from  
the network, or whatever.       

44
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:13,851
It gets all these things        
coming in, and it manages to    

45
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,986
hand them all out to whoever    
needs to handle them.           

46
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,289
And run loops aren't            
super complicated, but          

47
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:21,791
the reason I don't really talk  
about them is the run loop      

48
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,525
just kinda works on             
the main queue, and             

49
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:25,427
you don't really need           
to think about it.              

50
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,061
But if you ever find yourself,  

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,698
I wanna use a timer off the     
main queue, then you're gonna   

52
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,865
have to teach yourself          
about run loops, okay,          

53
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,202
because the timers are totally  
based, on the run loop.         

54
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,755
your purposes in this course    
as a starting, iOS developer,   

55
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:40,240
But for                         

56
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:44,677
you can assume that timers      
are a main queue thing, okay?   

57
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,779
Now, there's really, there's,   

58
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,415
you can create timers           
by instantiating them,          

59
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,417
but then you gotta put them     
on a run loop and all that.     

60
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,819
But, so there's really          
just one method,                

61
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,921
class method you're             
gonna use in timer.             

62
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,325
And what this one method does   
is it takes a block of code,    

63
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,910
And it takes how, when you      
wanna execute it some time in   

64
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,428
a closure.                      

65
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:07,730
the future and whether you      
wanna keep repeating executing  

66
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,598
it, and it goes and does that.  

67
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,934
It puts the thing on the run    
loop to make sure that it       

68
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:14,736
executes that block of          
code with that interval.        

69
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:17,906
Really couldn't be simpler,     
it's a very, very, simple and   

70
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,307
powerful UI right there.        

71
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:22,810
So down at the bottom,          
here's an example of it,        

72
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,279
this method is called           
scheduled timer.                

73
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:28,048
And it returns the timer that   
it creates when it schedules    

74
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,116
it and                          
puts it on the run loop.        

75
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:32,218
And so                          
here I'm just saying timer =,   

76
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,619
I have a local var timer.       

77
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,955
Notice it's of type timer,      
it's an optional timer here.    

78
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,724
And so I do timer =             
scheduledTimer(withTimeInter-   

79
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,126
val: 2.0, repreat,              
repeats: true).                 

80
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,794
And then the block,             
I put some code.                

81
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:45,663
Well, that's gonna execute      
that code two seconds from now  

82
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:46,797
approximately.                  

83
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,098
And since it's repeats true,    

84
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,066
it's gonna execute it again     
two seconds later and           

85
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:53,736
then two seconds after that     
until I stop this thing, okay?  

86
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,573
Now, one thing to note about    
this little example here,       

87
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,575
is notice my timer is weak.     

88
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:01,943
Okay, see that, weak?           

89
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:03,644
Why do I make that timer weak?  

90
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:05,646
Well, when I scheduled          
this timer, and                 

91
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:06,914
it puts it on the run loop,     

92
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,583
the run loop is gonna grab      
a strong reference to it.       

93
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,585
So I don't need a strong        
reference to it.                

94
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:14,320
And in fact, if I make my       
reference weak, then when       

95
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,223
this run loop is done with it,  
when this thing finally         

96
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:20,392
stops running, my ti, timer     
var there will be set to nil.   

97
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,693
Perfect, exactly what I want,   

98
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,029
because it's really no use      
tabbing a pointer to this       

99
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,231
timer if it's not               
running anymore.                

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,266
And if I ever wanted to         
start a timer up again          

101
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,901
that I'd stopped, I would just  
call scheduledTimer again,      

102
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,337
it's such a simple, API.        

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,872
So how do you stop a timer?     

104
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,307
So you got a timer and          
it's got repeating true and     

105
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,241
it's going off and              

106
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,110
it's doing this closure every   
two seconds or whatever.        

107
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:45,147
You stop it by sending          
the message invalidate to       

108
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:49,117
the timer, and so invalidate    
tells the run loop to stop,     

109
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:52,921
scheduling this thing and       
invalidates the timer.          

110
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,556
Now, again, this timer is       
going to not, if you do         

111
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,492
invalidate right there, and     
you have a weak var to it,      

112
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,862
it's gonna go out of the heap,  
which is really convenient.     

113
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,564
There's one last thing I'm      
gonna do about timers,          

114
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,166
which is tolerance.             

115
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:10,603
So this is not a real-time      
thing, and you might be quite   

116
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:13,805
tolerant of it not              
executing exactly on time.      

117
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:16,440
This makes more sense for       
timers that take longer, like   

118
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,576
let's say you have a timer      
that goes off every minute,     

119
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:19,643
and it does something.          

120
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:22,579
Well, you might be happy if it  
goes off 50 seconds from now    

121
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:23,880
or 70 seconds from now.         

122
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,883
So you would set a tolerance    
of 10 on the timer, and         

123
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,286
it means it'll go off in the    
window plus or minus that 10.   

124
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,721
By the way,                     
this does not have any drift.   

125
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,624
So, if it, if the system        
decided it was gonna go off in  

126
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:40,062
50 seconds this time, the next  
time, it wouldn't, you know,    

127
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,197
be shorter and shorter and      
shorter with each time.         

128
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,999
So, the time it goes off        
is the amount of time from      

129
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,267
the time you                    
started the timer.              

130
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:47,701
Even if it's two days later,    

131
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,036
it's still going off            
once per minute.                

132
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,938
It's once per minute since      
you started the timer.          

133
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,506
It's just that when it          
goes off, it'll be plus or      

134
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,341
minus a little bit each time.   

135
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,377
Now why would you want          
to tell the system this?        

136
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:01,346
Well, when your timer           
goes off, you know,             

137
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,381
it might be that the system     
is actually asleep.             

138
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,116
Your phone surprisingly         
sleeps a little,                

139
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:09,854
takes a little micro naps all   
the time, okay, to save power,  

140
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,955
especially to save battery.     

141
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,857
And wakes up every              
once in a while, and            

142
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,593
it kinda knows when it's        
gonna wake up again.            

143
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,629
And so the tolerance allows     
it to maybe take a micro nap    

144
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,731
a little longer cuz it's gonna  
wake up for something else,     

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,399
and then it could               
be your timer.                  

146
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,468
You see, so this is             
a little micro performance.     

147
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:28,469
But if you have                 
something to go on and          

148
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,471
off every minute over,          
you know,                       

149
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,606
long periods of time,           
it can add up.                  

150
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,375
Okay, so that's tolerance.      

151
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:37,444
All right, so,                  
let's do a little demo,         

152
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,613
see this in action, it's kinda  
obvious, once you see it.       

153
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:43,415
So I'm gonna take FaceIt,       
remember the FaceIt demo we     

154
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:45,151
had, this is                    
a picture of a face,            

155
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,953
I'm gonna make the eyes         
blink using a timer, okay?      

156
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,420
The timer's just gonna          
open the eyes and               

157
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,556
then close the eyes, open the   
eyes and then close the eyes,   

158
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,291
super simple.                   

159
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:57,362
So let's go back and            
get FaceIt, here it is.         

160
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:02,432
All right, so                   
here is our face view now.      

161
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,966
The thing about the blinking,   
I'm gonna,                      

162
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,169
I wanna show you this again     
because it's so important.      

163
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,538
I'm gonna actually put this     
blinking code in a separate     

164
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:11,273
view controller, which is       
a sub class of the other one.   

165
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:14,376
So we have this existing        
FaceViewController right here   

166
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:19,146
as the thing that controls      
this MBC right here, okay?      

167
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:21,983
Where this face is, it's, it's  
loading up the face right now.  

168
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:25,119
And so I could just put this    
code in FaceViewController,     

169
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:27,120
but just to show you it again,  
this,                           

170
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,457
this thing of, sub-classing     
another MBC to make one.        

171
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:32,825
I'm gonna create a new          
FaceViewController called       

172
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,427
a blinking FaceViewController,  

173
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,895
I'm gonna put all my            
blinking code, into that.       

174
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:42,434
So let's just go File > New >   
File, and Cocoa Touch Class.    

175
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,937
And I'm, it's a subclass        
of FaceViewController.          

176
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:48,907
And I'm gonna call it           
BlinkingFaceViewController.     

177
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,275
And that's gonna                
create a new class.             

178
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:53,344
I'll put it in same place       
everything else is.             

179
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,515
Okay, here it is, just delete   
all the code in here, again,    

180
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,451
just not to, so                 
as not to distract you.         

181
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,420
And you can see that it is a    
subclass of FaceViewController  

182
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,757
which is this thing right here  
that has all our stuff in it.   

183
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,892
And all the code that I'm       
gonna put inside here is        

184
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:12,060
only gonna be for blinking.     

185
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,395
And I'm gonna change,           

186
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:16,564
in my storyboard I'm gonna      
select this MVC down here and   

187
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:19,466
right now, its identity         
is FaceViewController.          

188
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,169
And I'm gonna change it to be   
a BlinkingFaceViewController.   

189
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:24,437
And that change alone           
is gonna make it so             

190
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:28,141
that this particular face view  
right there is going to blink.  

191
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,910
So how do we do that,           
how do we make this             

192
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,279
BlinkingFaceViewController      
work?                           

193
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,013
Well, what's going              
to be its model?                

194
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,515
Well, its model is              
going to be public and          

195
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,584
I'm gonna call it blinking,     
and                             

196
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,921
it's just gonna be a whether    
or not we're blinking, okay?    

197
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,291
And if someone sets this model  
of this blinking controller     

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,096
then I'm going to call some     
method like blinkIfNeeded,      

199
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,998
blinkIfNeeded, private          
func blinkIfNeeded,             

200
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,832
okay?                           

201
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,668
it's just going to              
blink if needed.                

202
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,503
Now if blinking is false,       

203
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:04,807
obviously the blinking is not   
needed so it won't be blinking  

204
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,510
but if it is blinking,          
then we need to blink.          

205
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,212
Now, just for                   
demo purposes right here,       

206
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,981
or maybe this is even what I    
would want, I'm gonna turn on   

207
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:17,585
my blinking when I appear,      
when my MVC appears on screen,  

208
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,686
and I'm gonna turn it           
off when I disappear.           

209
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,487
And you do need to think        
about this when you're using    

210
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,355
a timer.                        

211
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:25,124
That when your MVC goes         
off screen because it's in      

212
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:27,759
a navigation controller and     
someone navigates to something  

213
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,062
else or someone hits back,      
or some of that.                

214
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,697
You wanna make sure that        
you stop your timer.            

215
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,332
You don't want that timer,      
sitting there running,          

216
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,435
doing something,                
the MVC is not even on screen   

217
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,871
unless it's doing something     
I guess that's not UI based.    

218
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,975
But I'm gonna say here          
in my viewDidAppear,            

219
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,079
super.viewDidAppear.            

220
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:54,216
I'm gonna say here              
blinking = true.                

221
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,485
So every time my MVC            
appears on screen,              

222
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,688
it's gonna start blinking and   
in viewWillDisappear            

223
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:06,260
I'm going to say                
blinking = false.               

224
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,528
So, I'm gonna stop blinking     
when it disappears,             

225
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:09,796
does it make sense?             

226
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:12,432
Okay, so, that's going to       
obviously cause my stimer,      

227
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,934
timer to stop going cuz my      
timer is only gonna be going    

228
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:17,303
when I'm blinking, all right?   

229
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:19,372
So, how am I gonna              
implement blinkIfNeeded?        

230
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,472
Well, it's only if needed so    

231
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,742
I'm gonna say, if I'm blinking  
then I'm gonna do something,    

232
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:27,378
that is the if needed part of   
this blink thing right here.    

233
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:28,613
And what do I need to do?       

234
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:33,450
Well, first of all I'm gonna    
just have some constants here.  

235
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,653
I think I called it,            
what did I call this.           

236
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:39,689
I don't know, what did I        
call the constants here.        

237
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:41,825
Hm, well,                       
we'll just typing them in.      

238
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:45,628
So I'm gonna have a little      
struct here called BlinkRate.   

239
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:49,432
And I'm gonna have how long     
my eyes stays closed when I'm   

240
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,468
blinking, and how long it       
stays open when I'm blinking.   

241
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:57,105
So, let's have a static let     
closedDuration which is         

242
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:00,708
gonna be a TimeInterval.        

243
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:04,913
TimeInterval is just a little   
class or a little type that     

244
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:09,016
represents elapse time,         
it's pretty much a double.      

245
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,952
But whenever we're talking      
about TimeIntervals we kinda    

246
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,921
let people know in our code by  
using the TimeInterval type.    

247
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,792
And then I'm gonna have the     
same thing openDuration which   

248
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,494
is gonna be a TimeInterval.     

249
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:23,262
And, you know,                  
usually when we're blinking,    

250
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,631
our eyes stay open a lot        
longer than they're closed.     

251
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,733
So let's say something like,    
I don't know, 2.5 seconds or    

252
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:29,834
something like that.            

253
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:32,103
Okay, now if I was              
doing this for real,            

254
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,639
I'd probably have the amount    
it stays open be random         

255
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,574
within some tolerance, right?   

256
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:40,677
Cuz when we're blinking we      
don't go blink, blink, we,      

257
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,712
you know kind of                
sometimes we blink and          

258
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:45,248
then this short amount          
of time, but again, for         

259
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,983
demo purposes here we'll        
just fix it to be 2.5.          

260
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:49,751
All right, so we have that.     

261
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,486
Now, all we're                  
gonna do to blink,              

262
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:56,124
is we're gonna start by         
setting our eyes to be closed.  

263
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:58,459
So I'm gonna say self.          

264
00:11:58,528 --> 00:11:59,393
I don't even need self here.    

265
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:03,697
faceView.eyesOpen = false.      

266
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,367
Remember faceView is our,       
one of our superclass's vars,   

267
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,670
a public var in                 
our superclass.                 

268
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:13,606
That's maybe unfortunate it     
has to be a var, or public.     

269
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,107
It'd be nice if it              
was protected, maybe,           

270
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:18,777
we'd have no such thing, so     
it's public, outlet there.      

271
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,412
And we're setting it            
to eyesOpen to false.           

272
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,747
So we're starting our           
blink by closing our eyes.      

273
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:25,016
Now, after                      
the closed duration,            

274
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:26,250
we wanna open them back up.     

275
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,719
So, I'm gonna say,              
Timer.scheduledTimer and        

276
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,989
notice I'm not even looking at  
the return value of the timer   

277
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,556
cuz I never have                
to invalidate it.               

278
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,391
This is gonna be                
a one shot deal, and            

279
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,994
it's gonna automatically        
invalidate itself when          

280
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:38,661
it's done.                      

281
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,464
And so the time interval        
here we want is                 

282
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,434
BlinkRate.closeDuration,        
right?                          

283
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:47,769
We just closed our eyes.        

284
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:50,338
eyesOpen = false, and           
it repeats false,               

285
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,539
it's just gonna do it once.     

286
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,008
I'm going to call               
blinkIfNeeded again             

287
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,542
after I've blinked once.        

288
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,145
So I'm just gonna kind of keep  
calling blinkIfNeeded until     

289
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:01,180
blinking is not true anymore.   

290
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:05,551
And then here's the block of    
code that it, it's gonna call   

291
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,621
each time, and so it takes      
a timer as an argument there.   

292
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,822
Oops, yeah.                     

293
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:18,463
Timer and we don't,             
we can use a closing, Trailing  

294
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,265
closure syntax notation here,   
put that on the end.            

295
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,466
So here is the timer.           

296
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,034
So what do we need to           
do inside this timer?           

297
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:26,836
Well, we're just gonna          
open our eyes back up,          

298
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,838
so faceView.eyesOpen = true.    

299
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:31,974
And of course,                  
we're inside a closure here so  

300
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,808
we're gonna need self..         

301
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,711
And of course, we don't         
want to have the memory         

302
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,612
cycle here although             
this timer's so                 

303
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,682
short duration, probably        
that's not gonna be an issue.   

304
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:45,585
But we'll go ahead here and     
do weak self up here and        

305
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:49,122
just do Okay?                   

306
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,924
So now,                         
eyes are back open, right?      

307
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:54,627
And what do we need to do now?  

308
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:57,963
Well, if we're still blinking,  
we need to blink again.         

309
00:13:58,032 --> 00:14:00,866
So, we need, basically need to  
call blinkIfNeeded again, but   

310
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:02,534
we got to wait for              
our openDuration,               

311
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,435
leave our eyes open for         
that long and then,             

312
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:06,871
if we're still blinking,        
then we'll blink again.         

313
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,905
So blinkIfNeeded again.         

314
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:11,041
So, I'm just gonna do           
another timer inside here,      

315
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,609
which is perfectly fine.        

316
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,144
Even though I'm in a closure    
that's being executed           

317
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:18,147
0.4 seconds in the future, I,   
there's no law that says in     

318
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,616
that closure I couldn't         
schedule another timer,         

319
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,417
which is exactly                
what I'm gonna do.              

320
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,320
And this one,                   
the BlinkRate.openDuration,     

321
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:28,055
so I'm just gonna wait          
the amount open time,           

322
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:29,790
again it's not repeating.       

323
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:33,861
Okay and then in this guy's     
closure, which I'm also gonna   

324
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,963
do with trailing closure        
notation, timer.                

325
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,867
And heck, let's go ahead and    
do weak self,                   

326
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,869
we're not gonna know            
we're gonna want that In        

327
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,105
here I'm just gonna say         
self.blinkIfNeeded.             

328
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,740
And of course,                  
it will stop blinking if        

329
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,544
blinking has been set to false  
at any point here, okay?        

330
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,346
So, this is always gonna do     
one blink and then if it needs  

331
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:58,182
two, it'll do it'll go          
back and do another blink.      

332
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,352
So, yes, ?, at this weak.       

333
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:02,753
Okay, we got this code.         

334
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,587
So, that's it, that's all       
we need to do to blink,         

335
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,889
we're just gonna open or        

336
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,423
we're just gonna close          
your eyes rather,               

337
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,091
wait a little bit,              

338
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,025
open them back up,              
wait a little bit more and      

339
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,528
then blink again if             
w're still blinking.            

340
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:13,762
So let's see what               
that looks like.                

341
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:23,203
Okay, there he is.              

342
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,038
He's blinking.                  

343
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,174
Okay, and he'll work.           

344
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:28,841
Here, we'll just                
switch him around.              

345
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,676
He works no matter what.        

346
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,611
Whether he's happy or sad,      
he's always blinking.           

347
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,081
Now, one thing about            
this blink that's not so        

348
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,382
good is it's kind of abrupt.    

349
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,251
That's why I'm saying it's      
not really animation, right?    

350
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,286
We don't blink like this.       

351
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:45,121
Okay, nobody blinks like that.  

352
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,122
Okay, we kind of close our      
eyes a little bit slow.         

353
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,691
There's a little bit            
of motion to it.                

354
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,225
And so                          
we'd really like to do that.    

355
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:53,461
And so let's talk about some    
more animation capabilities we  

356
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,565
have and how we can do really   
more true animation of that,    

357
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,566
than just using a timer.        

358
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:01,702
So let's go back to             
our Slides here.                

359
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,773
Alright, so before I do that    
though, let me talk about and   

360
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,345
summarize not all actually,     
but most of the animation       

361
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,714
capabilities that               
you get with iOS,               

362
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:17,249
so the when I am gonna          
talk about in detail and        

363
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,785
demo today is animating         
UIView properties.              

364
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,788
There's only a few of           
the properties Vars,            

365
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,858
in other words, in UIView       
that you can animate.           

366
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,260
But they're pretty powerful     
few as you're gonna see, and    

367
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,196
allows us to do,                
a lot of animation.             

368
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:34,731
There's also, you can also      
obviously animate those         

369
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,333
controller animations like in   
a navigation controller when    

370
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,803
you click to go to the next     
card on the stack,              

371
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:43,739
it slides in, right,            
that's animated.                

372
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,808
And when you rotate your split  
view, those are animated        

373
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:48,843
transitions, that's             
all controllable.               

374
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:50,195
even though I'm not gonna talk  
at all about it in this class,  

375
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:51,479
And in fact,                    

376
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:52,546
might be a good final project,  

377
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,448
not covered in lecture          
thing for you, by the way.      

378
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,584
You, there's a whole            
infrastructure for              

379
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,787
writing your own                
controllers of controllers,     

380
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,621
like navigation controller,     
split controller,               

381
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,855
tab bar controller.             

382
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:04,956
And so, part of that            

383
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,692
mechanism includes              
full animation support.         

384
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,561
Now, underneath all of this     
animation I'm talking is        

385
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,863
Core Animation,                 
it's a framework, okay?         

386
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,965
Like UI kind of a framework.    

387
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,768
And Core Animation has          
a lot of mechanism for          

388
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,602
doing very sophisticated        
animation.                      

389
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,939
Now, not a lot of it            
bubbles up to the UI view       

390
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,907
animation that we're            
gonna talk about but            

391
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,710
kind of the simplest most       
straight forward once do.       

392
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:31,346
Again, this is something for    
your final project maybe you    

393
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:33,848
wanna do some more              
sophisticated animation.        

394
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:37,017
You could drop down into        
the core animationlLater        

395
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:40,721
is a little bit                 
about window in                 

396
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,059
the core animation              
from UI view.                   

397
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:51,531
It's a bar in UI view called    

398
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,538
I think it's called there's     

399
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:03,609
a lot of makings in for         

400
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:09,181
doing 3D animation.             

401
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,951
OpenGL as full OpenGL           
>> [COUGH]                      

402
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,786
>> There's another cool little  

403
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:18,222
kit might put this in some of   
your final projects called      

404
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,026
spritekit, spritekit is kind    
of 2.5 D animation typical      

405
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:25,763
animation we have like little   
character running around and    

406
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:29,466
he's jumping over things,       
shooting at things.             

407
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:31,902
That would likely be            
done with spritekit,            

408
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:34,504
it knows how to do              
things like fire.               

409
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,239
Things like that in addition    
to knowing how to layer         

410
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,408
images on top of each other     
and have them move around.      

411
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,344
So that's kinda fun, not gonna  
be able to talk about that.     

412
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,348
And lastly is physics-based     
animation, and we're            

413
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,115
gonna talk all about that at    
the end of this lecture, and    

414
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:49,917
then I'll demo                  
that on Wednesday.              

415
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,418
So the two I'm gonna talk       
about is the first one and      

416
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,920
the last one,                   
UIView animations, and          

417
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,889
then physics-based animation.   

418
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,626
All right, so let's talk        
about this UIView Animation.    

419
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:01,226
What can you animate.           

420
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,095
Well, these are the things      
you can animate.                

421
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,229
You can animate                 
the position of your view.      

422
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:07,732
So, you can make it animated,   
moving,                         

423
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,333
sliding around on screen.       

424
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:10,834
The view's moving around.       

425
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,204
You can animate                 
it's transform,                 

426
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:17,140
which primarily means,          
it's size or it's rotation.     

427
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,175
Okay?                           
Cuz the translation part of it  

428
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,476
transport, transform,           

429
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,012
you're pretty much gonna do     
with frame or center, okay?     

430
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:27,515
So you can rotate your view or  
scale it up and down.           

431
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,117
There's alpha, okay.            

432
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:31,853
Alpha you remember number is    
I didn't remember is opacity.   

433
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,124
So, how                         

434
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:41,662
much it's                       

435
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:49,703
transparent.                    

436
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,505
So that, takes closures.        

437
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:53,573
And inside these closures,      

438
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,008
you're gonna change             
these values, okay.             

439
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,444
And what the method,            
the class method's gonna do,    

440
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:02,047
is animate those changes,       
that you make.                  

441
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,448
All right, so                   
let's take a look               

442
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,016
at one of these class methods.  

443
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,485
This one's called               
animate withDuration.           

444
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:10,922
And you can see here            
that it takes these two         

445
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,389
closures right there.           

446
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,324
You see the two                 
green closures?                 

447
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:16,960
And the first green             
closure there,                  

448
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:20,864
inside there, you change any    
of those special vars, okay?    

449
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:23,833
Frame, center, alpha,           
etc, you change them.           

450
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,367
By the way, it makes those      
changes immediately.            

451
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,635
It does not take                
time to change them.            

452
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:28,937
Even though it takes time for   

453
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:31,205
it to appear on screen          
it happens immediately.         

454
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:34,075
And then the completion         
block is called                 

455
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,309
after the animation is done.    

456
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,645
So, you know, however your      
animation you take when it's    

457
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,212
completely done.                

458
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,149
Then this gets called and       
the finished                    

459
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:45,651
variable, err the finished      
argument to that closure        

460
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,787
is whether the animation        
got all the way to the end.     

461
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,688
And why could it might          
not get to the end?             

462
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:52,790
Some other animation might      
pick it up in the middle and    

463
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,826
start animating that            
bar to somewhere else.          

464
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,461
Okay, so,                       
here's what it looks like.      

465
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,362
To call that,                   
here's an example of it.        

466
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,030
So, here I have                 
a view called myView.           

467
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,835
[SOUND] And what I'm gonna do   
with this code right here is,   

468
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:08,037
I'm gonna take a view as        
long as it's fully opaque,      

469
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:11,640
fully visible on screen,        
I'm going to wait two seconds.  

470
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:15,210
And then, over three seconds,   
I'm gonna fade it out.          

471
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,245
Fade it to alpha,               
down to zero.                   

472
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:18,613
And then,                       
when it's fully faded out,      

473
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,616
I'm gonna remove it from        
the view hierarchy, okay?       

474
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:22,917
That's what this code does.     

475
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:26,553
So, you can see,                

476
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:28,422
So, if it's full power.         

477
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,457
And if it is, then I'm doing    
animate with duration.          

478
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:32,625
The duration of three seconds,  

479
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,660
that's how long it's            
gonna take this,                

480
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,529
the green code there to         
execute to, not to execute,     

481
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,030
but to show up on the screen.   

482
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,466
And then delay is how long I'm  
gonna wait till I start that    

483
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,234
animation.                      

484
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,552
we'll talk all about options,   
in a couple of slides.          

485
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,802
The options,                    

486
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:49,172
But here, curve linear          
means it's gonna go from        

487
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,976
alpha one to 1.0 in a linear,   
linear over time.               

488
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,478
So after one second it's gonna  
be a third of the way there.    

489
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,813
After two seconds it'll         
be two thirds of the way.       

490
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,648
And after the full time         
it'll be down to zero.          

491
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,351
In animations, you can          
see what I'm animating.         

492
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,387
I'm changing the alpha          
to zero, okay?                  

493
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:09,356
That's the change I'm making    
to those special bars.          

494
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:12,058
And then at completion you can  
say, if $0, which means if I    

495
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:16,397
finished, then remove           
this view from Superview.       

496
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,298
And remember, that              
completion applock is only      

497
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,032
called after                    
the animation is done.          

498
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:21,934
In other words,                 
five seconds from now.          

499
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:24,502
All right?                      

500
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:26,605
Now what's really interesting   
is on the next line there I     

501
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:30,708
say print myView.alpha equals   
the value of myView.alpha,      

502
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:35,880
that is going to immediately    
print zero, okay?               

503
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:38,983
That method animate             
withDuration, it only executes  

504
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,453
the first green closure there,  
myView.alpha = 0.0,             

505
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:45,988
and then it returns             
immediately after that.         

506
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:47,991
And at that point,              
myView.alpha is 0.0.            

507
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,261
The animation is just queued    
up to happen in the future.     

508
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,163
So always think of the changes  
you make with the animation     

509
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,998
system as happening right now.  

510
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,300
You're just executing that      
closer right now, but           

511
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,703
by putting it in this little    
wrap of this animate with       

512
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,772
duration, you're queueing       
up an animation to show         

513
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,109
the user that change that       
you've already made over time.  

514
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,711
Now it seems a little           
weird because, whoa,            

515
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,114
I changed it right now and so   
inside my code alpha is zero,   

516
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:18,084
but the user still              
sees it fully.                  

517
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,386
Opaque, which they do,          
for five seconds.               

518
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:23,589
It's still gonna be opaque      
until it completely fades out.  

519
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:24,823
But that's just                 
the way this works.             

520
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:26,058
You just gotta                  
get used to that.               

521
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:28,593
The animations always           
happen after the fact,          

522
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,927
over time, okay?                

523
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,696
But the changes you make        
happen immediately.             

524
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,231
All right?                      

525
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,468
Here's some of the options      
we can do when we animate,      

526
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:40,036
I talked about                  
the curveLinear,                

527
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:41,671
which is at the very bottom,    
right above it,                 

528
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:45,641
you see curveEaseInEaseOut,     
and curveEaseIn.                

529
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,509
These basically make it so      
that, instead of just linearly  

530
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:51,412
going from the start value      
to the end value of that var    

531
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,215
change, it starts off slowly,   
then goes up to normal speed,   

532
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:57,117
and then slows down at the end  
now, why do you want this?      

533
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,452
This is especially good for     

534
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
moving, when you're             
moving a view.                  

535
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,623
You don't want a view to be     
on screen and go [sound].       

536
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:06,659
You want to kinda go and        
then slow down at the end.      

537
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,660
It just feels, if you move      
something in real life,         

538
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:11,563
if you don't jerk it up here,   
you lift it up and              

539
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,731
then, you set it down.          

540
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,597
Same thing here.                

541
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,499
You want to lift it a few up,   
move it over, and               

542
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,567
then set it down, okay?         

543
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:18,335
So, that's why curve ease in,   
ease out.                       

544
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:22,071
So, you can control whether     
it eases on either end.         

545
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,640
Going to the one on the top,    
begin from current state.       

546
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,310
Remember I said                 
that that finished,             

547
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:30,045
argument to the completion      
handler would                   

548
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:32,180
only be true if the animation   
got all the way finished.       

549
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:35,317
Well, if you issue another      
animation while this            

550
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,452
ones like the previous one's    
still in flight during that     

551
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:39,770
If you issue another one that   
changes alpha in some other     

552
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,020
five seconds.                   

553
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:43,723
way, well, either that          
animation's gonna start from    

554
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:47,293
the new value of                
alpha which is zero.            

555
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,361
Okay, even though it's          
still in flight and             

556
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,498
hasn't shown that zero to       
the user, it still is zero.     

557
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,601
Or, whether the animation of    
the alpha, the new animation's  

558
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,636
gonna pick up wherever          
the other one is, okay?         

559
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,739
So, in another word, this is    
gonna pick up mid-flight and    

560
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,473
make the alpha go               
somewhere else.                 

561
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,209
So that's what begin from       
current state says should I     

562
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,113
look at what the user           
perceives, or is seeing         

563
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,515
as that alpha, or should I      
just use the real alpha,        

564
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:13,050
which has already               
been changed to zero?           

565
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:14,884
Okay.                           

566
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,186
So you can look through         
the documentation for           

567
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,587
all these options,              
I think there's 25 of them,     

568
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:21,923
so there's a lot of cool        
things you can do there.        

569
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:23,090
And we'll talk about            
some more of them               

570
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,726
some of these other             
UIView animations.              

571
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:27,394
All right.                      
So that's the UIView animation  

572
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:31,999
where you're animating one      
of these five special bars.     

573
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:35,268
So it's another thing you can   
do with UIView animation,       

574
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:38,270
is what if I have a view, and   
Imma change a whole lot of      

575
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:41,073
things about it, not just       
those special bars and          

576
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,908
to redrawn a different way,     
and                             

577
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:46,177
I wanna animate that            
whole change on screen.         

578
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:47,946
And there is a number of        
ways you can animate it.        

579
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,215
One, you can animate            
it by flipping over.            

580
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,750
So kind of like a plane card,   

581
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,152
would flip over                 
from the old view.              

582
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,553
Make all your changes,          
flips over.                     

583
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,054
Shows the new one.              

584
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,289
Another one is cross dissolve.  

585
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,591
Okay the old one showing.       

586
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:06,562
Then the new one dissolves in   
another one is curling up.      

587
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,597
The new one is kind             
of in the back.                 

588
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,233
The old one sitting up front.   

589
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,635
And the old one curls up like   
a piece of paper and shows      

590
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:17,671
part of the new one in the      
back, which is kind of fun.     

591
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,839
That transition really          
only make sense if you're       

592
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,575
covering the whole screen.      

593
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:25,544
It wouldn't make sense to have  
a curl up be in just a like     

594
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,080
view inside another view.       

595
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,148
The whole screen was a view,    

596
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,851
you wanna curl up would         
make sense, okay?               

597
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,121
So, this is entire view         
contents animation,             

598
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,657
not just those special things.  

599
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:41,491
It's done with a class method.  

600
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,727
It's called animate width.      

601
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:46,129
And it's, sorry,                
transition width.               

602
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,296
Not animate with.               

603
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:50,132
And transition width takes the  
view that it has all the stuff  

604
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,500
you wanna change.               

605
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,468
Duration obviously,             

606
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,202
some options like whether       
you're curling or               

607
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,038
cross dissolving or             
flipping and                    

608
00:26:57,106 --> 00:27:00,041
then the animations now in      
this case the green animations  

609
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,343
can change anything             
about the view.                 

610
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,743
Not just the five               
special things but              

611
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:05,412
absolutely anything.            

612
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,046
So that's what these            
animations are gonna do there,  

613
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,382
and then the completion         
is the same.                    

614
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:12,652
Okay, when the animation        
is done it tells you.           

615
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,354
So what's an example of         
this let's say I'm making       

616
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:16,154
a poker game and                

617
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:18,923
I want to show a playing        
card flipping over okay.        

618
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,425
So let's have a playing card    

619
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,260
view myPlayingCardView          
right there.                    

620
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:25,563
And it's got some bar           
on it cardIsFaceUp And          

621
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,231
if cards face up this true,     
then I got to see all           

622
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,166
the kings and                   
ace of hearts or whatever.      

623
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:31,968
And if the cards face           
down then I just see            

624
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:32,968
the back of the card.           

625
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:34,103
So I got this view.             

626
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:36,438
And I got it currently in       
one side and another and        

627
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:39,174
I want it to flip over and      
show the other state.           

628
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:42,911
Well here all I do is I do      
animate I do transition width   

629
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:43,978
my playing card view.           

630
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,212
I'm gonna do it in three        
quarter of a seconds.           

631
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,982
So it's gonna be                
pretty fast flip over.          

632
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:51,318
I'm using the option            
transition flip from left,      

633
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:54,554
which takes the left edge and   
flips it over.                  

634
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:55,788
And then inside animation so    

635
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,657
I'm just changing that          
cardIsFaceUp bar,               

636
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:02,093
the thing that controls which   
one my view is showing.         

637
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:03,828
And so                          
this is going to flip over and  

638
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:07,766
show the card in the other      
direction, okay?                

639
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,033
So that's cool,                 
that's when you wanna change    

640
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,501
the whole view.                 

641
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:12,869
But you're limit even           
what kind of you know,          

642
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,738
animation you can do,           
just flipping, dissolving and   

643
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,173
curling up in                   
it's full screen.               

644
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,375
there's another kind of change  
of views you wanna make which   

645
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,675
All right,                      

646
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:23,044
is a change to view hierarchy.  

647
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:26,080
So, this means you wanna put    
views in or take views out of   

648
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,016
the view hierarchy or           
replace one view with another.  

649
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:32,920
So this method is               
transition from two.            

650
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:34,988
So the from view is             
the view that's gonna be        

651
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:37,524
leaving the view hierarchy,     
and the two view is             

652
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,892
the view that's gonna be        
coming into the hierarchy.      

653
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,494
They don't have to be in        
the same place, by the way,     

654
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:43,261
they can be in different        
places on the screen,           

655
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,597
that's absolutely fine.         

656
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,765
usually they are in             
the same place.                 

657
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:52,503
And this animation here you     
notice that there is no         

658
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:56,073
animation block because         
implicitly what you're doing    

659
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,742
in this animation is replacing  
the one view with the other.    

660
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,011
I'm going from one view to      
another, so you've got the new  

661
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,813
view all set up the way         
you want presumably and         

662
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:06,515
you've got the old view and     
you just transition across.     

663
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:09,552
Now, Sometimes you don't want   
to actually remove these        

664
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,787
from the hierarchy, you just    
want to show and hide them.     

665
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:15,724
And so in the options you put   
.showHideTransitionViews.       

666
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:18,660
Then instead of remove          
from superview and              

667
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:22,497
adding subview,                 
it will just set the .hidden.   

668
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,532
Remember view has a .hidden     
bar that will hide it.          

669
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:29,170
And it'd set one to hidden and  
one to not hidden.              

670
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:30,937
All right?                      

671
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,439
I don't know maybe              
that property is called         

672
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:34,574
these days, anyway.             

673
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,710
All right so those are all      
ways to animate view so         

674
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,413
let's look at doing a couple    
of those in FaceIt so           

675
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:44,683
first I'm gonna do              
the animation where we          

676
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,020
change the entire view,         
and do flipping or              

677
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,524
cross-dissolving, to cause the  
blinking to be a lot smoother.  

678
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,693
And what I'm gonna do is        
I'm gonna take the two eyes     

679
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,229
in my face, replace them with   
views, that draw the eye,       

680
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,531
and then I'm gonna have         
the view change from            

681
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,700
open to closed doing            
a flip from top.                

682
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,869
See how that's gonna make       
it the eyes blinking.           

683
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:07,869
It's gonna flip over.           

684
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:10,838
That little circle is           
gonna flip over like that.      

685
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,207
And then,                       
we're gonna shake the head.     

686
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,407
This is a 2D head, so           

687
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,510
it's gonna shake it side to     
side instead of like this.      

688
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:17,478
Cuz it's only 2D.               

689
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,178
And we're gonna do that         
with the thing where we're      

690
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:21,147
gonna change one of             
the special bars.               

691
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:23,449
The bar we're gonna change is   
transform because we're gonna   

692
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,584
rotate our entire face.         

693
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:26,686
Okay, so let's do those.        

694
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:32,223
Let's go back to Xcode here.    

695
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:38,095
All right, so, to do the eye    
blinking, we need to            

696
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:42,934
have the eyes not be drawn, so  
right now, if we go to, oops,   

697
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:46,437
if we go to our FaceView right  
here, you can see that we       

698
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:50,074
draw our eyes by doing          
this UIBezierPath Right?        

699
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,441
And then down here if           
you remember in draw,           

700
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,010
we get the path for the I.      

701
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:58,280
And for both I's and            
we stroke it.                   

702
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:00,181
So we're not gonna              
do this anymore.                

703
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,385
Instead, we're gonna add two    
I views, which I'm gonna show   

704
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:07,321
you in a second, as subviews    
of this phase view.             

705
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,455
So we're not gonna do that.     

706
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:09,489
And we're not gonna need this.  

707
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:12,225
Actually I am gonna             
grab this Center                

708
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:16,562
of Eye out of here because      
I still will need to            

709
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:21,901
put my new Eye views somewhere  
and that knows how to do it.    

710
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,770
So the rest of this though,     
I'm just gonna comment out.     

711
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:25,537
Okay?                           

712
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:27,638
So we're not using              
that mechanism for              

713
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,040
drawing, instead                
we're gonna Eye view.           

714
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:33,610
Now in interest of time, I'm    
gonna drag this Eye view in.    

715
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,544
And show it to you.             

716
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,046
So we'll copy it in here.       

717
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:39,349
All right, so what is           
this EyeView look like?         

718
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:42,518
And super simple, it has line,  
width, and color too,           

719
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:43,986
just like the face does.        

720
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:45,654
It has eyesOpen,                

721
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,556
which would be the Bool         
whether they're true or         

722
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:50,992
not, and then it's draw-rect    
just if the eyes are open it    

723
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:55,396
uses an oval bezierpath,        
which is actually circle, and   

724
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:57,731
if the eyes are closed it       
just does move to line two.     

725
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,168
Okay, this is pretty much the   
exact same code that was in     

726
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:04,271
the The faceview and then here  
at setting it's line with       

727
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,673
setting it's color, stroking    
color and then stroking it.     

728
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,308
And what this does?             

729
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:10,876
Any question about this code?   

730
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:13,578
Super straightforward,          
all right?                      

731
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:19,084
So we need to fix our faceview  
over here to use those eye's,   

732
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,985
those eye views instead.        

733
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:23,254
So how are we gonna do that?    

734
00:32:23,322 --> 00:32:26,056
It's really just a matter of    
creating these eyeViews and     

735
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:28,025
then putting them               
in a right place.               

736
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,259
All right?                      
So                              

737
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:30,727
let's start with                
creating them.                  

738
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,930
So I'm gonna have a private     
var and I'm gonna try to say,   

739
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:40,468
leftEye = createEye, and then   
have a private funk called      

740
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:45,374
createEye Which returns         
an EyeView let's say okay and   

741
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:49,610
it will return it now,          
I wanna do this but             

742
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,279
it's not gonna work,            
does anyone see what's          

743
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:56,684
definitely not gonna work       
about code just like this?      

744
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:58,285
Okay, what I'm I doing here?    

745
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:01,721
I'm initializing                
leftEye right?                  

746
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:05,624
And am I allowed to call        
a method on my self before      

747
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,526
I fully initialized?            

748
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:12,297
No, okay, so that's why         
that's not gonna work there.    

749
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,933
And you can see that the error  
is cannot use instance member   

750
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,802
'createEye' cuz property        
initializers run before 'self'  

751
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,503
is available.                   

752
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:20,404
That's exactly what             
we think here.                  

753
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:25,141
So a fix for                    
this is to make this lazy.      

754
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,612
Cause if you make this lazy,    
it's not going to actually      

755
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:32,282
run this initialization, this   
initialization is not going to  

756
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,651
run until we are fully          
initialized.                    

757
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:37,853
By definition because no        
one can call this LeftEye,      

758
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,822
no one can access this until    
we're fully initialized.        

759
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,789
So,that's great.                

760
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:43,290
Now this doesn't work either,   
okay?                           

761
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,560
And why doesn't this work?      

762
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:46,627
This doesn't work bec-, and     

763
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:49,263
maybe we'll even see            
an error here, yeah.            

764
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,633
Let's see, yeah, okay.          

765
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,935
So you see it says you          
cannot use member createEye.    

766
00:33:56,004 --> 00:34:00,939
When you do lazy vars you       
need to specify the type.       

767
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:01,907
Okay, so you need to say.       

768
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,908
You have to explicitly type.    

769
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,778
You can't,                      
let it infer the type.          

770
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:07,478
So that thing.                  

771
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,713
Now, there's still              
a problem here.                 

772
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:09,813
Another problem.                

773
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:13,049
It's saying here,               
use of instance me,             

774
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,318
member create type              
on face view.                   

775
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,285
Type face view.                 

776
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,954
Did you mean on a value         
of face view instead.           

777
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,790
And in fact, exactly, we did.   

778
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,792
It's trying to find             
a static function called        

779
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,660
createEye, right?               

780
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:26,961
A static function.              

781
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,795
But we don't want that.         

782
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,029
We want an instance one, and    

783
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:31,832
the way we specify              
that is with self.              

784
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:35,635
Self says I want createEye      
that's on an instance like      

785
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:37,671
this, not one that's static.    

786
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:40,673
So that can be a little         
complicated, right there.       

787
00:34:40,674 --> 00:34:41,674
Okay?                           

788
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,446
Let's get through that but      
just to know this               

789
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:53,183
is the way to get around        
having to write and             

790
00:34:53,252 --> 00:35:00,090
an initializer now obviously    
I'm not providing a frame, so   

791
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:07,431
I'm gonna have to set its size  
and position here sometime.     

792
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,033
Notice my eye is not            
going to be opaque.             

793
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:15,238
That's because I,               
if my face was blue or          

794
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,540
something, I would want         
that blue to show through.      

795
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:20,909
I wouldn't want it to           
be opaque and so this           

796
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:23,811
eye is going to be completely   
transparent except for          

797
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,749
the parts that I draw with      
non-transparent colored ink,    

798
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:28,616
basically.                      

799
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:32,118
I'm going to set my color       
equal to the color of my face.  

800
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:35,889
I'm going to set my eyes lines  
with to be the same lines with  

801
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:36,489
the face.                       

802
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:38,625
Remember this is                
just bars here.                 

803
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:42,494
And face view right?            

804
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:43,896
Color in line with color.       

805
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:50,168
And I'm also going to just add  

806
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:55,439
subview, this eye because       
I'm at face view I'm gonna      

807
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:59,009
add this subview as a subview   
of myself and I'm gonna return  

808
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:02,713
the eye because this is         
the createEye returns the eye.  

809
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:06,583
Okay, everyone understand       
this little method?             

810
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:09,385
Quite simple.                   
I'm just configuring this eye,  

811
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:12,053
and using it for                
the left and the right eye.     

812
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:14,155
What about                      
positioning this eye?           

813
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:17,391
There, I didn't say             
where this eye is.              

814
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,893
the sub-view it's in the upper  
left corner size zero zero, so  

815
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:20,327
I added it for                  

816
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:21,762
that's no good.                 

817
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,264
Lets create a private here.     

818
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,734
Called positionEye,             
and it's positionEye.           

819
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:29,902
Hello.                          
PositionEye.                    

820
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:34,239
And it's gonna take an eye,     

821
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:38,444
it's gonna be an eye view.      

822
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,179
And it's gonna take             
the position to put it,         

823
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:43,448
where to put it center which    
is gonna be a CGPoint.          

824
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:46,217
And we need to get the size     
of the eye, well, the size of   

825
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,786
the eye remember depends        
on the size of the face, so     

826
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:49,987
in a big face the eye is big,   

827
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,956
in a small face the eye is      
small and if you remember       

828
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:57,293
we have these nice little       
score radius constants.         

829
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,894
So, I have this ratios,         

830
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:03,466
score radius to eye radius,     
remember that?                  

831
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,534
And I'm gonna make it           
two cuz here I'm talking        

832
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:09,605
about the width and             
height of my view, and          

833
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,240
the radius is only radius,      
not diameter.                   

834
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:14,209
So I'm having to say            
times two there.                

835
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:16,744
So now, I know how big this     
little EyeView needs to be.     

836
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:20,481
And so I'm gonna say            
eye.frame = CGReft For          

837
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:25,151
now we'll have the origin be,   
CGPoint.zero, I'll,             

838
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,189
I'll put it in this center      
right here in a second, but     

839
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:32,691
right now I'm gonna make        
the origin zero, and            

840
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,528
the size is a CGSize, where     
the width is the size and       

841
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:43,002
the height is the size,         
it's square Okay and now        

842
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:49,073
we'll just set the eyes center  
equal to the center there.      

843
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,542
Okay, an equal                  
sign right there.               

844
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,345
this little guy right here is   
just gonna position the eye.    

845
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:55,545
Okay, so                        

846
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:59,082
Now, when do we wanna           
position that eye?              

847
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,284
Okay now this is                
very important.                 

848
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:03,652
When we're in a view            
controller, we know when our    

849
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,155
bounds of our top level         
view changes, because we        

850
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:09,191
get viewDidLayoutSubviews       
sent to us, remember that?      

851
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,060
If we're a view,                
this faceView is a view,        

852
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:14,028
not a controller, a view.       

853
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:16,998
It gets told whenever its       
bounds changes by being sent    

854
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,300
the message, layoutSubviews.    

855
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,034
Okay?                           

856
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:22,435
So, lay out subviews,           

857
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:27,506
you said sent to all views      
when it's bound changes or      

858
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:30,843
anytime that its subviews       
need to be relaid out.          

859
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,110
And that's exactly              
what we want here,              

860
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,778
we gotta relay out those Eyes.  

861
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:37,481
We've gotta move those Eyes     
to their current position.      

862
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,117
So, what is that position?      

863
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:43,020
We're just gonna say position   
Eye, we'll do both eyes so      

864
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:44,921
let's do the left eye first.    

865
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,358
And to get the position of the  
eye we have this nice method,   

866
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:51,027
center of eye that we pulled    
out of the thing that we        

867
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,862
commented here, path for eye.   

868
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,532
It knows how to calculate       
the position of a given eye.    

869
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,034
So, we'll just say that         
the position here is center     

870
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,035
of eye.                         

871
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:05,440
And we'll say we want           
the left eye in this case.      

872
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:10,611
That, and all right, and        
there's something, sorry        

873
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,184
this is positionEye center,     
okay, so that's our left eye.   

874
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:18,519
Now let's do our right eye.     

875
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,857
Okay, everybody got that?       

876
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:25,992
So every time our               
balance changes,                

877
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,928
we get layoutSubviews,          
we're gonna move those eyes     

878
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:30,429
to wherever they're             
supposed to be,                 

879
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:34,700
the centerOfEye thing, okay?    

880
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:36,300
We got an extra argument,       
I guess I didn't,               

881
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,937
I made that be that.            

882
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:41,705
Yeah, that makes sense.         

883
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:42,339
Okay?                           

884
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:44,607
All right,                      
what else do we need to do?     

885
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,408
Only one other thing            
we need to do is that,          

886
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:49,611
remember that the eyes want to  
have the same color in line     

887
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,879
with and whether or             
not they're.                    

888
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:52,847
Open as the face.               

889
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:56,617
Okay, so all these places up    
here where we set eyes open     

890
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,119
and where set the line within   
color we need to forward that   

891
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,689
on to our left and right eyes,  
so let's do it here for         

892
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,057
color first.                    

893
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:04,958
Let's go down here.             

894
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:08,027
Now, for color we still need    
setNeedDispaly because other    

895
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:11,763
things in the view besides      
the eyes are certain color,     

896
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:12,932
the mouth, etcetera.            

897
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,965
But we do need to say,          

898
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:18,536
that our left eyes color        
equals this new color.          

899
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:22,273
And also our right eyes color   
equals the new color and        

900
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:24,241
exactly the same here.          

901
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:29,046
For the lineWidth we            
want to say that our left       

902
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:33,383
eye's lineWidth equals          
our lineWidth and               

903
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:38,488
our right eye's lineWidth       
equals our lineWidth.           

904
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:41,391
And probably most importantly,  
when the eyes are opened and    

905
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:45,060
closed on our face view         
we want to have that set.       

906
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:49,298
In our views, now, notice that  
we don't need setNeedsDisplay   

907
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:53,769
anymore because we don't draw   
the eyes in our draw(_rect's.   

908
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:55,437
See in our draw(                
_rect) down here?               

909
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:56,404
We commented that out.          

910
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:57,305
We don't draw the eyes.         

911
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,473
The eyes are drawn by these     
two sub views that we           

912
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,241
added with add sub view there.  

913
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,045
So here we can get rid          
of setNeedsDisplay.             

914
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:11,283
and instead we're just gonna    
say leftEye.eyesOpen =          

915
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:17,890
eyesOpen and rightEye.eyesOpen  
= eyesOpen, okay?               

916
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,494
See how we're just forwarding   
that on to those two views.     

917
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,595
Right, any questions            
about that?                     

918
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:27,232
Let's go make sure we haven't   
broken anything here by         

919
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,767
making our eyes be              
separate views.                 

920
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,935
Our views, overall our          
face views should look          

921
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:32,602
exactly the same.               

922
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:35,272
It's just using sub-views       
to draw part of itself          

923
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,907
rather than,                    
drawing it in DrawRec.          

924
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:38,807
And sure enough                 
it's working fine.              

925
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,509
It's even continuing            
to blink because that           

926
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:42,077
blinking is done                
by the controller.              

927
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:44,312
The controller is setting       
eyes open, eyes closed,         

928
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:46,781
eyes open eyes closed and       
that's being forwarded on.      

929
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,681
To the view and is blinking.    

930
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,817
Now of course, this, we         
haven't changed the animation   

931
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,453
so it's still kind              
of this instablink.             

932
00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:56,356
So now we want to use the UI    
view animation to make that     

933
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:58,091
blinking a lot smoother.        

934
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,958
So how are we gonna do that?    

935
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:01,760
Let's go over to our            
eye view right here.            

936
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:04,629
And every time eyes open        
is changed, instead of just     

937
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:07,865
changing it, we're going        
to animate that change.         

938
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:09,667
So we are going to              
instantly change it.            

939
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,037
But on screen it's going        
to be animated, All right?      

940
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:16,206
So to do that I'm actually      
going to make eyes open         

941
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:18,308
be private var right there and  

942
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm going to create             
the public eyes open.           

943
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:22,544
Which is a Bool and             

944
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:26,515
this thing is going to be the   
thing that does the animation.  

945
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:27,315
Okay?                           

946
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:29,851
And, because setting            
this eyesOpen does              

947
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,653
the NeedsDisplay,               
which causes this,              

948
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:33,354
I still want all                
that functionality,             

949
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:36,724
it's just that when someone     
publicly sets my eyes open,     

950
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:40,060
I want to animate, the change   
that's going on there, so,      

951
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:41,060
how am I gonna do this?         

952
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:46,799
All right, when someone gets    
whether the eyes are open,      

953
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:52,438
I'm just gonna return the       
private eyesOpen All right.     

954
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:56,709
And if they set this            
eyes opening thing.             

955
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:02,581
And they're gonna say, if       

956
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,652
the new I'm gonna               

957
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:11,622
do this UIView.transition       
with view, okay?                

958
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:13,424
Not this one.                   

959
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:18,195
I want transition with view,    
not from to, which              

960
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,296
remember is removing things     
from the view hierarchy.        

961
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:24,934
This one is transitioning       
inside of view and so           

962
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,703
I'm gonna do self as the view.  

963
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,304
This is the EyeView.            

964
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,373
The duration, I should          
make it constant here, but      

965
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,176
I'll just say point four        
to make this expedient.         

966
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:39,547
The options I want to           
transition from top to bottom   

967
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:43,317
because an eye blink kind       
of comes from the top, so       

968
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:44,451
we'll do that and               

969
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,489
then here are the animations    
we're going to do right here.   

970
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:51,824
And, I don't actually need      
this completion because we're   

971
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:53,826
not gonna do anything           
when it's done.                 

972
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:56,329
Notice that that's              
an optional closure.            

973
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:57,530
You see how it's                
got a question mark             

974
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,530
on the end of it?               

975
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:01,166
So, I will just not             
include that whole thing.       

976
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,536
All right, so                   
what do I wanna do in here?     

977
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:07,304
In here, I wanna make all       
the changes to the view         

978
00:44:07,373 --> 00:44:08,705
that I want to be animated.     

979
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:10,173
Well here, it's super simple.   

980
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:14,511
I'm just gonna set my underbar  
i's open to be the new value.   

981
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,514
All right,                      
we're in set here so            

982
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:20,483
new value is whatever sum       
of that eyes open equal.        

983
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:21,917
So here I'm just gonna          
set it to the new value.        

984
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:26,922
That's going to change my view  
to I, the new eyeOpen state.    

985
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:30,625
And I'm going to animate        
getting to there, all right?    

986
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:31,259
So let's take a look.           

987
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:39,333
This guy should                 
still be blinking.              

988
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:41,701
But he should be blinking       
a lot smoother, you see?        

989
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,671
Cuz it's animating the actual   
motion of the eyes closing.     

990
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,543
Like that, and                  
again works in all.             

991
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:56,849
All right,                      
now the next thing we gonna do  

992
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:59,418
is have this guy                
shake his head, so              

993
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,952
I'm just gonna rotate           
the entire view okay?           

994
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:04,689
He's gonna shake his head by    
going little to the left.       

995
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:05,723
All the way back                
over to the right,              

996
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,257
and then back to the middle.    

997
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:09,025
That's gonna be shaking         
his head, okay?                 

998
00:45:09,094 --> 00:45:11,760
That's the best I can           
do in 2D right here.            

999
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:12,862
So, how are we                  
gonna do that one?              

1000
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,197
We're gonna do that one by      
animating one of those special  

1001
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:18,700
bars in UI View,                
which is the transform.         

1002
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:19,834
So let's go,                    

1003
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:23,104
we're gonna do this in          
our FaceView controller.        

1004
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,705
Okay.                           
So, it's gonna something about  

1005
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:27,241
is kind of all phases can do,   
so, we'll put it in there.      

1006
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,243
Let's put it right in here,     
I think, it's a good space for  

1007
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,345
it, some room, and              

1008
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:37,850
I have some Constance for       
this, a headshake Constance.    

1009
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,086
So, angle is just the angle     
I'm gonna to turn to the left   

1010
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,888
and angle back                  
to the right and                

1011
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,890
remember that we're             
in radians in here.             

1012
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:48,426
So it's zero two pi to go all   
the way around a circle so      

1013
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,595
I'm going to go pi over six,    

1014
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,262
which is a little bit           
around the circle.              

1015
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:56,066
And then segment duration is    
how long I'm gong to take       

1016
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:59,236
to do each turn, to the left,   
back to the right, and          

1017
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:01,771
back to the middle, okay so     
each of those are going         

1018
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,673
to take, in this case,          
half a second.                  

1019
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,508
So before I write               
the animation code,             

1020
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:08,977
I'm gonna make a nice           
little private func here        

1021
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:13,147
called rotateFace(by:).         

1022
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:15,749
And it's gonna take             
a CGFloat which is radians,     

1023
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,185
number of degrees               
to rotate the face.             

1024
00:46:18,254 --> 00:46:19,620
And it's gonna rotate it.       

1025
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:21,221
And the way we                  
do this is just,                

1026
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,190
we take                         
the faceView.transform.         

1027
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:26,993
Okay remember we're on          
the control over here so        

1028
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:30,229
faceView a vara vars and we're  
gonna make it equal to the      

1029
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:32,698
faceViews.transform.rotated     
by.                             

1030
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:38,103
Rotated by that amount.         

1031
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:45,609
Okay, to make to make           
this a little nicer,            

1032
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,313
we'll say, by angle, by angle.  

1033
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:52,282
Okay, so, this is just a nice   
little function that rotates    

1034
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,785
the face at any amount of       
degrees and 'm gonna use this   

1035
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,287
inside my animation code        
to rotate the face.             

1036
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,522
Anybody cool with that          
of what that code does?         

1037
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:02,924
So, transform right here.       

1038
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:08,897
Is alpine transform             

1039
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:12,767
rotated by,                     

1040
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:18,038
is just a method on             

1041
00:47:18,107 --> 00:47:23,644
CGF transform.                  

1042
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:27,514
ShakeHead cuz it's gonna shake  
the head back and forth.        

1043
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,648
And it's gonna be animated, so  

1044
00:47:28,717 --> 00:47:32,752
I'm gonna say right off the     
bat right, UIView.animate and   

1045
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:35,454
the one I want here for         
animation is this one right     

1046
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,856
here because I need             
the completion.                 

1047
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,291
Why do I need the completion?   

1048
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,693
Because the way I'm gonna       
make this rotation happen is    

1049
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:44,496
I'm gonna rotate to the left    
and when it completes.          

1050
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:45,663
I rotate to the right.          

1051
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,933
And when that one completes,    
I rotate back to the middle.    

1052
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:51,601
So, do you see why I need       
to know when each rotation      

1053
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,602
is completed.                   

1054
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:54,670
So, that's why I need this      
animate with duration that      

1055
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,205
has completion at the end.      

1056
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:59,074
Now, this one also has          
completion but it has options.  

1057
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,075
We don't need any option.       

1058
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:03,044
We're just gonna use standard,  
animation.                      

1059
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,180
We're not gonna ease in, ease   
out or any of that business.    

1060
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:07,782
Okay, so                        
this is the one we want.        

1061
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,150
Just to make this               
a little more readable,         

1062
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,886
I'm gonna do this little        
trick that I often do.          

1063
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:14,721
Just so you can see each        
argument one by one.            

1064
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:21,294
So the duration of a tilt is    
the HeadShake.segmentDuration,  

1065
00:48:21,363 --> 00:48:23,563
okay, that constant             
that I put up here.             

1066
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:26,799
The animations, okay,           
this is what we're going to do  

1067
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:28,199
to cause this                   
animation to happen.            

1068
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:30,401
Well, we're just gonna          
rotate the face.                

1069
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,672
Now this ro, first rotation     
is to rotate to the left.       

1070
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:37,709
And in iOS, different           
from Mac OS by the way.         

1071
00:48:37,777 --> 00:48:43,814
In iOS, positive values of      
angles are counter clockwise.   

1072
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:45,282
So we want a positive angle,    

1073
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,850
cuz we're going                 
to the left here.               

1074
00:48:46,918 --> 00:48:49,952
So I'm gonna make this          
be my HeadShake.angle.          

1075
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,955
Okay, it's gonna rotate         
by the HeadShake.angle.         

1076
00:48:53,024 --> 00:48:55,591
That's gonna head it            
off to the left there.          

1077
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:58,828
Now when it's done here,        
this completion code            

1078
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:02,031
which has finished,             
whether it's finished or not,   

1079
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,132
and I do want to wait for       
it to be finished.              

1080
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:09,236
Actually, I'm going to,         
I think, yeah, put this inside  

1081
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:12,373
here just to make this a        
little easier for you to see.   

1082
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,976
But this is the completion,     
okay.                           

1083
00:49:16,045 --> 00:49:21,481
So that guy there,              
that guy there, okay.           

1084
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,317
So this is the code that        
happens when it's completed.    

1085
00:49:24,386 --> 00:49:30,223
And if it has yeah,             
sorry, self.rotate.             

1086
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:34,826
By the way, do we need memory   
cycle breakage here, etc?       

1087
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:38,062
No, because we're in the        
middle of an animation, okay?   

1088
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:39,931
That view controller            
is on the screen.               

1089
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,201
We do not have to worry about   
creating memory cycles here.    

1090
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:44,969
Because we know that thing      
is gonna be in the heap.        

1091
00:49:45,037 --> 00:49:45,869
Because it better               
be in the heap,                 

1092
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:47,871
cuz we're animating right now!  

1093
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:49,472
So this is a case where         
we don't really need            

1094
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:50,907
to do weak self and             
all that stuff.                 

1095
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:54,042
All right, so                   
when it completes,              

1096
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:56,745
we're gonna say if it           
finished, which it should.      

1097
00:49:56,813 --> 00:49:59,781
Because I'm not issuing         
any other animations here.      

1098
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,082
But one day, maybe I'll         
add some new animation.         

1099
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:04,152
In which case,                  
I might interrupt this.         

1100
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,653
But, so it's always             
good to check finished,         

1101
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:09,355
even if you're 100% sure this   
thing is always gonna finish.   

1102
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:12,292
Which we are in this case,      
as our code is written now.     

1103
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,026
So if it's finished,            
what I want to do now is        

1104
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,961
animate going back              
over to the right.              

1105
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,530
So I'm just gonna               
UIView.animate withDuration     

1106
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,531
again, okay.                    

1107
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,900
And again, I want the one       
with completion here.           

1108
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:28,572
Okay, and this time, I'm gonna  
do the same amount of time      

1109
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:29,873
to go back to the right.        

1110
00:50:29,942 --> 00:50:31,408
So let's HeadShake.             

1111
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:33,610
You could imagine that maybe    
this duration would wanna be    

1112
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:35,077
different since                 
I'm going farther.              

1113
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:37,613
But actually, I think it's      
probably right to have to be    

1114
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:39,281
this way, as you'll see.        

1115
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,482
And these are kinda concepts    
you can play with to make your  

1116
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:43,518
HeadShake look like             
the way you want.               

1117
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:44,686
And here at the animations,     

1118
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:46,987
I'm gonna rotate my face        
back the other way.             

1119
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:49,222
So it's gonna have to           
be a negative value.            

1120
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:51,090
And I want to go twice as far,  
so                              

1121
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:53,460
I'm gonna do                    
HeadShake.angl*2.               

1122
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,728
Okay, I'm gonna go all the way  
back, past the middle, and      

1123
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:57,429
over to the right.              

1124
00:50:57,498 --> 00:51:02,434
And then here, for the          
completion here, I'm going to   

1125
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:07,906
again line this up so you can   
see it a little better, click.  

1126
00:51:07,975 --> 00:51:09,574
So inside the completion here,  

1127
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:12,009
I'm gonna rotate                
back to the middle.             

1128
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:14,245
So yet another,                 
in fact, watch this.            

1129
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:17,747
Copy, paste.                    

1130
00:51:17,816 --> 00:51:20,583
Although with this one,         
I don't need a completion one   

1131
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:22,619
at the end because I            
have completed it.              

1132
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:24,586
And here obviously,             
I'm not going backwards.        

1133
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:26,722
I'm going forwards again,       

1134
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:30,159
which forwards is               
counter clockwise there.        

1135
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:33,962
All right,                      
that's everything there.        

1136
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:36,131
And what else do we got here?   

1137
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,967
Oops, forgot a curly            
brace there, comma.             

1138
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:42,603
What else?                      

1139
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:44,737
We're missing some curly        
braces or something, yeah.      

1140
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,107
What do we got here?            

1141
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:52,311
This is finished in,            
That's it.                      

1142
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,147
No, wait, what else do we got?  

1143
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:57,716
This doesn't match anything.    

1144
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:01,753
Yeah it does, it matches this.  

1145
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:02,721
Okay, hold on.                  

1146
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:08,660
Anybody see where I'm           
missing a Animations,           

1147
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:11,929
another curly brace             
missing right there.            

1148
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:16,800
And I do think we're gonna      
need a curly brace there.       

1149
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,601
Okay, lots of curly braces and  
parentheses there.              

1150
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,736
We're doing it, we got it.      

1151
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,637
Okay, so everyone understand    
what's going on here?           

1152
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,772
So we're just shaking back and  
forth.                          

1153
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,874
You know, I know that's gonna   
finish because I don't have     

1154
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:28,042
any other animations going on   
that might interfere with it.   

1155
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,445
But to be correct, I should     
probably always put that,       

1156
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,181
if finished, in there if        
that's what I intend.           

1157
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,315
Sometimes I gonna do something  
even if it doesn't finish.      

1158
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:37,451
But in this case,               
I do want it.                   

1159
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,752
All right,                      
let's take a look at this.      

1160
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,354
And this is a very interesting  
combination of animations       

1161
00:52:41,422 --> 00:52:42,889
going on here,                  
as you're gonna see.            

1162
00:52:44,024 --> 00:52:46,725
All right, so, sorry.           

1163
00:52:46,793 --> 00:52:49,694
Let's make some action          
cause it to shake its head.     

1164
00:52:49,763 --> 00:52:50,996
Okay, let's do taps.            

1165
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:53,398
Right now if we tap,            
it blinks the eyes.             

1166
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:55,365
But we already got              
a blinking eye right now, so    

1167
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:56,400
we don't need tap anymore.      

1168
00:52:56,469 --> 00:52:59,135
So I'm gonna go up              
here to tap right here,         

1169
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:00,203
this tapRecognizer.             

1170
00:53:00,272 --> 00:53:01,671
And I'm gonna                   
comment this out.               

1171
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:03,405
And I'm gonna show you          
a different way to do           

1172
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:04,206
just a recognizer.              

1173
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:04,840
Did I show you how to           

1174
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:08,009
do just your recognizer         
directly in the storyboard?     

1175
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:09,043
I don't think I've              
shown that yet, so              

1176
00:53:09,112 --> 00:53:10,444
let me show you                 
how to do that.                 

1177
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:11,212
It's really easy,               

1178
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,147
we're gonna go to our           
storyboard right here.          

1179
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,849
And this will actually          
show another cool thing.        

1180
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:18,784
So here is my MVC.              

1181
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:21,519
I'm gonna bring up my           
assistant editor so             

1182
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,688
that I can connect to it.       

1183
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:25,790
And you're gonna see            
that it brings up               

1184
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,858
BlinkingFaceViewController.     

1185
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:33,330
Now I wanna make a connection   
to a gestureRecognizer here.    

1186
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:35,399
I don't want it to be in        
BlinkingFace controller,        

1187
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,768
I want it to be in              
the super class.                

1188
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:39,302
But it knows that this          

1189
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,337
MVC right here is a             
BlinkingFacingViewController,   

1190
00:53:41,406 --> 00:53:44,674
so it's trying to               
automatic show it to me.        

1191
00:53:44,742 --> 00:53:47,709
So how can I get                
FaceViewController here, and    

1192
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:50,011
am I allowed to hook            
up to the super class?          

1193
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,280
And the answer is,              
you are allowed to hook it up.  

1194
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:54,682
And the easiest way to do       
it is to hold down Option,      

1195
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,651
the Option key, and             
click on it over here.          

1196
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,554
Cuz Option means open it        
up in the assistant editor.     

1197
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:02,756
So now I have                   
the FaceViewController here.    

1198
00:54:02,825 --> 00:54:07,160
And so now I could wire         
up a gesture to that.           

1199
00:54:07,229 --> 00:54:11,130
All right, so how do I wire up  
a gesture from my UI without    

1200
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,266
typing code like all            
this stuff right here?          

1201
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,367
And the answer is,              

1202
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:19,704
we go to the Utilities window   
and search for gesture.         

1203
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:21,873
And you'll see that there's     
quite a few gestures here,      

1204
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:24,141
that you can do tap gestures,   
pinch gestures, rotation,       

1205
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,676
swipe gestures, etc.            

1206
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:28,778
And you just get the view       
that you want here,             

1207
00:54:28,847 --> 00:54:30,847
let me zoom in on it some.      

1208
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,116
So you got this,                
this FaceView right here.       

1209
00:54:33,185 --> 00:54:35,552
And you just drag the kind      
of gesture you want,            

1210
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,687
like a tap gesture,             
on top of it.                   

1211
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:42,391
And that's gonna make this      
view recognize a tap gesture.   

1212
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,492
Now where did it appear?        

1213
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,427
It appeared right               
here at the top.                

1214
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:48,429
And I can click on it and       
inspect it over here actually.  

1215
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:50,764
I can set how many              
taps we want,                   

1216
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:52,365
how many fingers we             
want to go down.                

1217
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:54,701
All that stuff we do in code,   
we can do it here.              

1218
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:57,170
And then how do I get this      
tap gesture to actually         

1219
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:58,872
do something in my code?        

1220
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,773
Well I just Ctrl + drag,        
of course.                      

1221
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,408
I'm gonna hold                  
down Control and                

1222
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:04,609
drag from this tap              
gesture in here.                

1223
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:06,344
I want an Action.               

1224
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:08,379
Okay, it's going to be          
TapGesture as the argument.     

1225
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:10,881
I'm gonna call this             
also shakeHead.                 

1226
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:11,882
Same name, but                  

1227
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:15,619
this one has the argument of    
the tapGestureRecognizer.       

1228
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:16,653
Okay, everyone see that,        

1229
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:18,287
how to hook up a gesture        
in the storyboard?              

1230
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,055
It's pretty simple actually.    

1231
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:23,092
I prefer actually               
to do it in code.               

1232
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,228
And why do I prefer             
to do these gestures            

1233
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,162
in code like this?              

1234
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:29,964
I just find that                
those gestures that             

1235
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:31,966
are in the storyboard           
are a little hidden.            

1236
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:33,700
They're up in that              
tiny bar up there, and          

1237
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:35,769
I don't really notice           
them sometimes.                 

1238
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:37,270
So, so,                         
I kind of like to do this.      

1239
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,172
But it's personal               
preference really.              

1240
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,906
There's nothing wrong with      
doing them in the storyboard.   

1241
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:42,307
Some people would               
say that's better               

1242
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:43,642
cuz then everything             
is in the storyboard.           

1243
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:45,410
It's really easy to see         
what the gestures are.          

1244
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:46,911
Eh, either way.                 

1245
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:48,913
All right, so                   
here's our shakeHead gesture.   

1246
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:49,613
What are we gonna do?           

1247
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:52,282
Well, we're gonna shakeHead,    
all right?                      

1248
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:54,785
We're just gonna call this      
animated one up here.           

1249
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,020
Everybody got that?             

1250
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:01,323
Let's clean up our white        
space a little bit here.        

1251
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,857
All right, so                   
let's run this time.            

1252
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,894
And now we can tap on our face  
and it should shake its head    

1253
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,530
left and then right,            
and back to left.               

1254
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,534
Sorry left and then, right      
back the middle, all right.     

1255
00:56:13,602 --> 00:56:15,369
So, here we go,                 
this guy is blinking, okay,     

1256
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:17,837
it's done again, no matter      
what kind of guy is and         

1257
00:56:17,906 --> 00:56:20,206
let's tap,                      
he went the other way.          

1258
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:21,173
So, I was wrong,                

1259
00:56:21,242 --> 00:56:23,576
I was get this wrong about      
which way is which in iOS.      

1260
00:56:23,644 --> 00:56:27,445
So actually, I guess            
positive values are yes,        

1261
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:28,546
clockwise, I guess.             

1262
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:30,581
I think the documentation       
is backwards on this,           

1263
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:31,481
if I remember correct, and      

1264
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,983
they might have fixed it,       
but anyway.                     

1265
00:56:33,052 --> 00:56:34,918
So we go forward and            
then back.                      

1266
00:56:34,987 --> 00:56:37,554
Now, a couple interesting       
things to note here.            

1267
00:56:37,623 --> 00:56:39,155
Look at our other animation.    

1268
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:41,056
It continues perfectly happy.   

1269
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:43,292
It does not care that           
we're rotating this view.       

1270
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:45,427
It's completely                 
irrelevant to that, and         

1271
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:46,894
that's the way                  
animations work.                

1272
00:56:46,963 --> 00:56:49,430
As long as they're not          
touching the same values,       

1273
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:51,265
they can work completely        
independently.                  

1274
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:55,068
Another thing to note here      
is this is a sub view           

1275
00:56:55,137 --> 00:56:55,835
of this view.                   

1276
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:58,572
And when I transform it,        
it moves                        

1277
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,675
all of the sub views with it,   
which is kinda cool, okay.      

1278
00:57:01,743 --> 00:57:04,009
So even if you build            
a view out of sub views,        

1279
00:57:04,078 --> 00:57:05,978
then if you animate it,         
rotate it or                    

1280
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:08,914
whatever, the sub views         
will get rotated as well.       

1281
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:11,449
All right, everybody got that?  

1282
00:57:15,387 --> 00:57:16,453
All right.                      

1283
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:17,186
That's all l wanted             
to show you.                    

1284
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:20,123
So that's the power             
of UIB animation.               

1285
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:22,091
I'm not even shown you a lot    
of the cool things you can do   

1286
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,860
like moving views.              

1287
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:25,827
Okay, having views moving       
across the screen.              

1288
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:27,996
The reason I didn't show you    
that with this view animation   

1289
00:57:28,065 --> 00:57:29,464
is pretty obvious how           
would you do it but             

1290
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:32,233
also because on Wednesday,      
I'm gonna be showing you        

1291
00:57:32,302 --> 00:57:33,901
really powerful way to          
move you with this across       

1292
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,769
the screen with this            
physic phase one which is       

1293
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:37,504
the next thing we're gonna      
talk about with the slides.     

1294
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:41,307
All right,                      
let's back into the slides.     

1295
00:57:45,279 --> 00:57:48,114
All right, so,                  
dynamic animation.              

1296
00:57:48,182 --> 00:57:51,483
Now, this is a different        
approach than the UI-based      

1297
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,585
animation I just said.          

1298
00:57:53,653 --> 00:57:55,436
what you do is set up all       
this physics like gravity and   

1299
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:57,220
In this case,                   

1300
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:01,057
things like that and then you   
just put the UIViews in there   

1301
00:58:01,126 --> 00:58:05,896
and they get affected by those  
physics, and they move around.  

1302
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:08,364
Okay, this is the best of       
fundamental I do it now,        

1303
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:09,232
how do you do it?               

1304
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,033
What's the mechanism for        
doing it?                       

1305
00:58:11,102 --> 00:58:12,968
First, you're gonna wanna       
create an instance of this      

1306
00:58:13,037 --> 00:58:15,671
class called                    
UIDynamicAnimator, okay?        

1307
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,372
A UIDynamicAnimator is          
the thing that controls all     

1308
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,509
the physics based animation     
in a view hierarchy.            

1309
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:22,042
Okay?                           
We'll show you                  

1310
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:23,277
how to create                   
that in a second.               

1311
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:26,479
Then, you're gonna add what     
are called UIDynamicBehaviors   

1312
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,847
to that animator.               

1313
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,748
And as soon as you add          
a behavior to an animator,      

1314
00:58:29,817 --> 00:58:31,050
it will start                   
behaving that way.              

1315
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:35,187
And then finally you're gonna   
add UIDynamicItems, which       

1316
00:58:35,256 --> 00:58:39,457
are usually UIViews, 99% of     
the time, to those behaviors.   

1317
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:41,659
And then, those behaviors will  
start acting on those views.    

1318
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,995
So that's it, it's a three      
stage, three level thing.       

1319
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:46,029
You got the animator,           
you add behaviors to it,        

1320
00:58:46,098 --> 00:58:47,464
those behaviors                 
start happening.                

1321
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:49,900
You add UIViews                 
to the behaviors,               

1322
00:58:49,969 --> 00:58:51,935
now they start being            
effected by the behaviors.      

1323
00:58:52,004 --> 00:58:52,802
You can do it in any order.     

1324
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,736
You could put the views in      
the behaviors first and         

1325
00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:58,307
behaviors and the animator,     
whichever you want to do.       

1326
00:58:58,376 --> 00:59:00,508
So how do you create            
a UIDynamicAnimator?            

1327
00:59:00,577 --> 00:59:04,446
All it needs is the coordinate  
system it's going to work in.   

1328
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:04,946
Okay?                           

1329
00:59:05,014 --> 00:59:06,581
So UIDynamicAnumator,           

1330
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:09,749
it's constructor here takes     
the argument ref into view.     

1331
00:59:09,818 --> 00:59:12,552
This is just the UI view whose  
coordinate system is gonna be   

1332
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:13,653
the coordinate system for       

1333
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:16,255
all the animation               
that we're doing.               

1334
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:18,991
Now, the views don't have be,   
all the drawing doesn't have    

1335
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,193
to be in one view it can be     
in a whole bunch of views but   

1336
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:23,361
they have to be in the same     
view hierarchy and              

1337
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,997
you're gonna want reference     
view at the top of that         

1338
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:26,765
view hierarchy, okay?           

1339
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,766
That's the only                 
restriction there.              

1340
00:59:29,835 --> 00:59:32,036
So now,                         
you start adding behaviors.     

1341
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:34,905
So you do that by creating      
concrete instances              

1342
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:36,138
of UIDynamicBehavior,           

1343
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:38,507
in other words sub classes      
of UIDynamicBehavior,           

1344
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:39,241
to do what you want.            

1345
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,642
So, there's                     
a gravity behavior,             

1346
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:44,279
which creates what seems to be  
gravity, pulling the views.     

1347
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,047
a collision behavior where the  
views run into something like   

1348
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:48,280
And, or                         

1349
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,917
the edge of the screen or       
another view and                

1350
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:51,017
they bounce off.                

1351
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,451
Okay?                           
And we're gonna talk about      

1352
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,853
all these dynamic               
behaviors and                   

1353
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:56,121
how we configure                
them in a minute.               

1354
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,390
And then the UIDynamicItems,    
one thing to note about         

1355
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:03,294
the UIDynamicItems is that      
if you add, let's say           

1356
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,830
you have item1 and item2 like   
in this example right here.     

1357
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,265
I've added Item 1 and           
2 to the gravity.               

1358
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:10,667
So they're both affected by     
the gravity behavior, but       

1359
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:13,604
I only added Item               
1 to the collider.              

1360
01:00:13,673 --> 01:00:15,205
Let's say,                      
it's a collision behavior and   

1361
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:17,407
let's say there's               
a boundary at the bottom.       

1362
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:19,909
So one, let's say               
the gravity goes down, and      

1363
01:00:19,977 --> 01:00:22,211
there's a boundary at           
the bottom for the collider.    

1364
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,846
Items 1 and                     
2 are gonna accelerate down     

1365
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:27,249
towards where the gravity       
is pulling them but             

1366
01:00:27,317 --> 01:00:29,851
then item2 is gonna             
keep on going.                  

1367
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:33,420
And item1 is gonna bounce       
off the boundary, okay.         

1368
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:35,755
So if you don't add the UIView  
to a certain behavior,          

1369
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:37,291
it won't be affected            
by that behavior.               

1370
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,828
Now, these items that           
you add to behaviors            

1371
01:00:41,897 --> 01:00:44,730
implement this protocol         
called UIDynamicItem,           

1372
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,465
which UIView already            
was implementing.               

1373
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:48,934
Okay, before they               
even invented this,             

1374
01:00:49,002 --> 01:00:51,803
because all this in             
the UIDynamicItem protocol is   

1375
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:54,605
balance, which you              
just get because your           

1376
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:58,242
balance are affected            
by your transform, and          

1377
01:00:58,311 --> 01:01:00,777
so, you get your balance so     
you know where to draw.         

1378
01:01:00,846 --> 01:01:02,746
And then, setter, sorry,        

1379
01:01:02,814 --> 01:01:05,748
the center and the transform    
are things that can be set.     

1380
01:01:05,817 --> 01:01:10,653
So, the animator can really     
only change where the view is   

1381
01:01:10,722 --> 01:01:13,623
and its rotation and scale.     

1382
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:15,824
Okay, that's all that           
the animator did, but           

1383
01:01:15,893 --> 01:01:16,692
that's a lot.                   

1384
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,896
Okay, rotation scale you can    
see, especially center where    

1385
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:23,931
the thing is, is a lot of what  
the animator is, is doing.      

1386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,201
Now, one interesting thing is   
once you add a dynamic item     

1387
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,936
to a behavior that's been       
added to an animator,           

1388
01:01:30,005 --> 01:01:33,773
then the animator has control   
over its center and transform.  

1389
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:35,375
And if you wanna                
change the center and           

1390
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:38,611
transform without removing it   
from the Dynamic animator,      

1391
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,847
you've gotta tell the Dynamic   
animator, hey, I change this.   

1392
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,515
Otherwise, it's gonna change    
it right back to what it        

1393
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:44,849
thinks it is.                   

1394
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:45,951
Right.                          
So don't fight your             

1395
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:48,987
dynamic animator if you         
wanna change the center or      

1396
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,755
transform a view that you've    
added to an animator.           

1397
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,957
You have to tell the animator   
using this method right here.   

1398
01:01:54,026 --> 01:01:55,759
Update item using               
current state.                  

1399
01:01:55,828 --> 01:01:59,228
And you just pass the UIView    
that you change the center or   

1400
01:01:59,297 --> 01:01:59,929
transform of.                   

1401
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:01,964
And it will pick up what        
you changed it to, and          

1402
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:02,865
continue from there.            

1403
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:06,617
Let's talk about some of        
the specific behaviors.         

1404
01:02:06,618 --> 01:02:07,900
All right?                      

1405
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,437
There's gravity behavior.       

1406
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,339
So, gravity behavior,           
it's just like gravity.         

1407
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:14,641
And by default, when you        
create a gravity behavior,      

1408
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:18,945
the gravity is down             
which means kind of down        

1409
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:24,383
towards the home button,        
basically in portrait mode.     

1410
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:27,386
And, its, magnitude is 1g.      

1411
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:29,921
[LAUGH] Okay, 1.0.              

1412
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:34,659
And 1.0 means 1,000 points per  
second per second per second.   

1413
01:02:34,728 --> 01:02:38,063
Remember that gravity           
is an acceleration.             

1414
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:40,631
Okay, hopefully you all have    
enough physics to know that     

1415
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,799
gravity is an acceleration.     

1416
01:02:41,868 --> 01:02:44,535
Anybody know what               
the gravity on Earth is?        

1417
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:48,671
9.8 meters per second square,   
right?                          

1418
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,508
So, in screen it's              
a thousand points per second    

1419
01:02:52,577 --> 01:02:55,043
squared and what's really       
interesting about a thousand    

1420
01:02:55,112 --> 01:02:57,413
points per second squared       
it's a very round number but    

1421
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:00,516
it feels a lot like 9.8         
meters per second squared.      

1422
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:02,751
Now, if you have your           
phone you put the UI,           

1423
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:03,985
a view at the top and           

1424
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:06,820
you apply this gravity          
behaviour to it, it will fall   

1425
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,389
almost exactly the same as      
real life object would fall.    

1426
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,859
It's really pretty              
amazing actually.               

1427
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:13,460
And yet it's such a round       
number like that.               

1428
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:16,195
So you can tweet                
these numbers though,           

1429
01:03:16,264 --> 01:03:17,930
you could have                  
the gravity be up.              

1430
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:20,365
For example,                    
when I pull out my phone and    

1431
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:23,001
I swipe up from the bottom,     
okay.                           

1432
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,235
Feel free to do it if           
you want right now.             

1433
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:25,536
When you swipe up               
from the bottom,                

1434
01:03:25,604 --> 01:03:27,804
the little control              
panel comes up.                 

1435
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:29,373
If kind of flies up,            

1436
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:32,942
that's actually using this      
mechanism and its gravity up.   

1437
01:03:33,011 --> 01:03:35,345
So, gravity is actually         
pulling that thing up           

1438
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:36,412
when you swipe.                 

1439
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,313
And what's more, when it hits,  

1440
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:39,447
you notice it doesn't           
just come up and                

1441
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:43,084
stop, it kind of bounces        
a little, off the end, okay?    

1442
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,752
And that's                      
a collision behavior.           

1443
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,454
So that thing coming up is      
a combination of a gravity      

1444
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:50,023
behavior and a collision        
behavior or it might be using   

1445
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,392
a snap behavior, which          
we'll see in a second too.      

1446
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,293
So anyway, that's gravity,      

1447
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,994
and you can see gravity         
in any direction, and           

1448
01:03:55,063 --> 01:03:59,364
we're going to do that in our   
demo on Wednesday quite a bit.  

1449
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:01,100
Another one is                  
an attachment behaviour.        

1450
01:04:01,169 --> 01:04:03,935
This allows you to take         
two dynamic items, or           

1451
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:06,838
a dynamic, dynamic item and     
a fixed point and               

1452
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,841
attach them at some             
distance apart.                 

1453
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,809
And how would this play out?    

1454
01:04:11,877 --> 01:04:13,410
Well, let's say I               
had a UIView and                

1455
01:04:13,479 --> 01:04:16,547
I attached it to this           
a center point and              

1456
01:04:16,615 --> 01:04:20,049
let's say that UIView, in       
addition to being affected by   

1457
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:23,486
this attachment behavior was    
also affected by gravity.       

1458
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:26,755
Then it would come down and     
swing like a pendulum.          

1459
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:28,557
Okay, because the attachment    
behavior would                  

1460
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:30,659
be constantly attaching         
it to this point.               

1461
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:32,894
But the gravity would be        
constantly trying to pull it    

1462
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:34,629
down and it would swing.        

1463
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:36,264
Do you see?                     

1464
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:37,631
So that's an attachment         
behavior.                       

1465
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,998
The attachment behavior,        

1466
01:04:39,067 --> 01:04:41,034
one thing that's                
really cool about it,           

1467
01:04:41,102 --> 01:04:44,103
you can change the length of    
the attachment in real time.    

1468
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,437
So the thing is animating and   

1469
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:49,274
you can be changing the         
distance that is attached, so   

1470
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,578
you can create all kinds of     
crazy, motions using that.      

1471
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:56,614
All right, CollisionBehavior.   

1472
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:58,615
CollisionBehavior is            
exactly what you think.         

1473
01:04:58,684 --> 01:05:00,251
You can setup collisions.       

1474
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,586
The collisions can either       
be between all the items        

1475
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:05,154
that are in the behavior.       

1476
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:07,090
They're being affected          
by the behavior.                

1477
01:05:07,158 --> 01:05:08,991
And or                          
any number of boundaries and    

1478
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:11,827
these boundaries are just       
UIBezierPaths so you can        

1479
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:15,296
register these UIBezierPaths    
with the CollisionBehavior and  

1480
01:05:15,365 --> 01:05:17,932
all the items that              
are affected by behavior will   

1481
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,201
bounce off of those             
boundaries, okay?               

1482
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,202
They could be round,            
they could be curved,           

1483
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:24,871
they could be any               
path that you want.             

1484
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,840
A common boundary by the way    
you want to put is a boundary   

1485
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:30,176
all the way around              
the reference area.             

1486
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:32,678
Just to contain all             
the items inside.               

1487
01:05:32,747 --> 01:05:36,182
And you can do that with this   
var translate reference bounds  

1488
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:37,216
If you set that on a collision  
behavior, then it will          

1489
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:38,182
into boundary.                  

1490
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:40,919
kind of automatically put       
a boundary around the edge and  

1491
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:43,954
keep everything Inside          
the reference bounds.           

1492
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,523
Now you notice the argument     
here these boundaries have      

1493
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:49,459
identifiers so                  
that you can tell which ones    

1494
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,095
you hit when they hit and I'm   
gonna show you how you find     

1495
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:54,664
out about that in a second but  
you notice the identifier is    

1496
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:59,168
an NSCopying you've never       
seen NSCopying there before,    

1497
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:02,838
NSCopying for the purposes of   
this basically means NSString   

1498
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:05,808
or NSNumber Okay, so the        
identifier could be a number    

1499
01:06:05,877 --> 01:06:08,043
or a string but there's NSs.    

1500
01:06:08,112 --> 01:06:11,046
Now, that's no problem          
because you can just            

1501
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:15,516
as them to a string or          
to an Int if you wanna,         

1502
01:06:15,585 --> 01:06:18,886
use Int as your identifiers     
but you do have to do that as.  

1503
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:23,323
So, NSCopying is basically      
NSString or NSNumber Number,    

1504
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:25,291
now, why do we need             
that identifier?                

1505
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,094
Because when a collision        
happens with a boundary,        

1506
01:06:28,163 --> 01:06:32,131
the collision, behavior has a   
delegate, and it'll tell you.   

1507
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,767
So, if you set yourself as the  
collision behavior's delegate,  

1508
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:38,070
then, if you have any           
boundaries set in there, or     

1509
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:40,672
if two items are colliding      
with each other, you're gonna   

1510
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,009
get this sent to you, this is   
a collisionDelegate method      

1511
01:06:44,077 --> 01:06:47,378
CollisionBehavior begin or      
ended contact for               

1512
01:06:47,447 --> 01:06:51,548
some UIDynamicItem, UI View,    
if this bouncing around         

1513
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:54,551
in there with the boundary      
identifier NSCopying.           

1514
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:57,287
So, there's that identifier     
telling you this boundary that  

1515
01:06:57,356 --> 01:06:59,622
you sent is doing this and      
leave and                       

1516
01:06:59,691 --> 01:07:03,326
tell you the point at which     
those two things collided       

1517
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,061
If you're, if it's talking      
about collision within two UI   

1518
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:09,298
dynamic items then it'll say    
with UIDynamicItem instead of   

1519
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:10,265
withBoundaryIdentifier.         

1520
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:12,566
Okay?                           
So this is really cool.         

1521
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:13,667
When the collisions happen      

1522
01:07:13,736 --> 01:07:15,035
you get to find out             
that they happen.               

1523
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:17,571
And again, we're gonna use      
that in our demo as well.       

1524
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:19,638
All right.                      

1525
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:21,073
SnapBehavior.                   

1526
01:07:21,142 --> 01:07:23,709
So a SnapBehavior is basically  

1527
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:27,012
move this view from here        
to over here behavior.          

1528
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,913
And why it's called             
the snap behavior is,           

1529
01:07:28,982 --> 01:07:31,882
it doesn't move it over         
there really jerky and          

1530
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:34,952
kind of stiff, it moves it      
over and when it gets there,    

1531
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:38,322
it's almost like four springs   
are attached to the corners     

1532
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:41,190
and it kind of                  
vibrates a little bit.          

1533
01:07:41,259 --> 01:07:44,527
It flies over there, probably   
eases in, then eases out, and   

1534
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:47,330
then when it gets there, it     
kind of shakes a little bit.    

1535
01:07:47,399 --> 01:07:48,697
Okay, like there's              
springs in the corner.          

1536
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:51,667
And you can set the stiffness   
of those springs with damping.  

1537
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,402
So, highly damped, they'll      
come in and just [SOUND] stop.  

1538
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:57,472
And really springy springs,     
they'll come in and             

1539
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,890
kinda really bounce around      
when it arrives in there.       

1540
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:00,240
go [SOUND],                     

1541
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,909
So, why do we do that?          

1542
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:05,178
Because when we move things     
across screen to a new place    

1543
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,015
In real life we don't want      
it to feel so abrupt.           

1544
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:09,916
Right.                          
When we move things,            

1545
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,884
again we want things            
to feel smooth, and             

1546
01:08:11,953 --> 01:08:14,519
so snap to is                   
definitely the way to           

1547
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:19,357
move something to a known       
place with the system.          

1548
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:22,527
Similarly there is something    
called pushBehavior,            

1549
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:25,196
a pushBehavior gives            
a UIview a push.                

1550
01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:28,031
Okay, so we already know how    
to make the UIviews accelerate  

1551
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,667
towards somewhere               
with gravity.                   

1552
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:34,337
Push is almost like             
imparting a velocity to it.     

1553
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:35,605
Now, there is two               
kinds of push.                  

1554
01:08:35,673 --> 01:08:39,275
There is instantaneous push     
which is just one time push,    

1555
01:08:39,344 --> 01:08:44,580
okay in parts                   
a certain energy to it.         

1556
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:47,649
There you can see magnitude     
1.0 is a 100 x100 view,         

1557
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:50,518
would get a 100 pts/s/s.        

1558
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:52,454
Is kinda push to it.            

1559
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:56,190
But then there's also           
continuous push which is        

1560
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:57,390
you just push along behind.     

1561
01:08:57,459 --> 01:08:59,026
So that's velocity.             

1562
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:00,961
Okay, you're giving             
the thing velocity.             

1563
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:03,163
Cuz you're just constantly      
pushing it at some rate.        

1564
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:06,798
So you can do both              
things there.                   

1565
01:09:06,867 --> 01:09:09,233
One thing that's really         
annoying about push behaviors   

1566
01:09:09,302 --> 01:09:11,035
is the instantaneous ones.      

1567
01:09:11,104 --> 01:09:14,539
You add the behavior to the,    
animator.                       

1568
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:15,205
Right?                          

1569
01:09:15,274 --> 01:09:16,574
And then, it pushes it and      

1570
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:18,541
then just sits there            
doing nothing,                  

1571
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,778
okay it doesn't like disappear  
after you spontaneous push,     

1572
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:24,280
even though I mean I'm          
not gonna push it again.        

1573
01:09:24,349 --> 01:09:27,750
So we want to clean that up     
and I'm gonna show you towards  

1574
01:09:27,818 --> 01:09:31,386
the end of this talk how those  
instantaneous pushes, but       

1575
01:09:31,455 --> 01:09:33,689
it is a little                  
annoying that does it.          

1576
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:35,657
Now continuous push is          
different because it's          

1577
01:09:35,725 --> 01:09:37,992
constantly pushing so you       
don't want it to be cleaned up  

1578
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,827
if you want to be               
sitting there pushing.          

1579
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:44,097
There's another kind of         
behavior which is kind of       

1580
01:09:44,165 --> 01:09:47,467
a meta behavior, called         
the dynamic item behavior.      

1581
01:09:47,535 --> 01:09:49,169
Okay?                           
Dynamic item behavior,          

1582
01:09:49,237 --> 01:09:51,570
not dynamic behavior,           
dynamic item behavior.          

1583
01:09:51,639 --> 01:09:55,507
And, this I like to think       
of as the physics behavior.     

1584
01:09:55,576 --> 01:09:58,443
This is essentially             
describing the physics          

1585
01:09:58,511 --> 01:10:02,580
that apply when all the other   
behaviors do stuff, okay?       

1586
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:05,583
So this is things like,         
allows rotation.                

1587
01:10:05,652 --> 01:10:06,483
That's saying like,             

1588
01:10:06,552 --> 01:10:10,554
if two things collide, should   
they be allowed to spin off?    

1589
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,123
Or do they have to keep,        
you know, non-rotated,          

1590
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:15,291
bounce off non-rotated.         

1591
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,061
Friction, after things bounce   
off each other, or if they're   

1592
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:21,831
just moving around, do they     
get slowed down by friction?    

1593
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:23,733
Okay, so if you have gravity    
and there's friction.           

1594
01:10:23,801 --> 01:10:25,367
They're not gonna               
accelerate as fast because      

1595
01:10:25,436 --> 01:10:26,601
they're being slow down.        

1596
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:30,105
Elasticity when things          
banging to each other do they   

1597
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:32,674
bounce off with the same        
energy they had coming in?      

1598
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:35,075
That would be elasticity        
1.0 or do they gain             

1599
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:39,379
energy by collision that would  
be elasticity above 1.0.        

1600
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:42,048
Or did they lose energy as      
they collide each other that    

1601
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:43,850
would be elasticity             
less than 1.0.                  

1602
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:46,418
Okay, so you see how this,      

1603
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:48,286
is the behaviour just like      
a collision behaviour or        

1604
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:50,054
a grably behaviour or           
push behaviour.                 

1605
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:51,655
But it's a behavior             
that's like meta,               

1606
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:53,757
it's like describing how these  
things should behave and        

1607
01:10:53,826 --> 01:10:55,959
all the other behaviors.        

1608
01:10:56,028 --> 01:10:59,329
These behaviour also can        
tell you the linear velocity    

1609
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:02,332
of an item which is actually    
interesting to know.            

1610
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,902
And why do I wanna know the     
linear velocity of an item?     

1611
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,539
A lot of times,                 
if I got a view, an MBC and     

1612
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:10,506
it's animating.                 

1613
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:13,542
And then, I click away from     
it like a Tab bar or I,         

1614
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:17,145
in the navigation controller,   
I push something else on.       

1615
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:19,948
I wanna pause that animation.   

1616
01:11:20,016 --> 01:11:21,849
Well, there's no                
real way to pause.              

1617
01:11:21,918 --> 01:11:24,318
Okay, when your view goes       
off screen, when your view      

1618
01:11:24,387 --> 01:11:27,020
controller disappears,          
you're going to want to remove  

1619
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:29,055
the behaviors from the          
animator and stop animating.    

1620
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:32,124
cuz you don't want to be        
animating not on screen.        

1621
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:33,926
Okay, it's a waste of energy.   

1622
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:38,330
But when you go to the view,    
you want all of the animated    

1623
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,498
things to continue              
as they were.                   

1624
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:41,399
Well they will except for       

1625
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,434
they'll have lost               
all their velocity.             

1626
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:45,403
So you have to put              
their velocity back.            

1627
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,504
So you grab all their           
linear velocities,              

1628
01:11:47,573 --> 01:11:48,806
store them away somewhere and   

1629
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:51,374
when you come back,             
add the linear velocity back.   

1630
01:11:51,443 --> 01:11:54,343
You could also use the linear   
velocity here to put a speed    

1631
01:11:54,412 --> 01:11:55,978
limit on objects.               

1632
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:57,012
If we have time on Wednesday,   

1633
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,680
which I doubt we'll have time,  
but.                            

1634
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:00,815
If we could get to              
the speed limit feature.        

1635
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,883
By the way we're building       
like space game where we're     

1636
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,285
flying through asteroids.       

1637
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:06,319
That's what we're going         
to build with this thing.       

1638
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,522
Maybe we want the asteroids to  
have a speed limit where just   

1639
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:09,956
aren't going so                 
fast that there's no way        

1640
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:12,058
our ship could possible         
dodge them or whatever.         

1641
01:12:13,461 --> 01:12:16,628
So we use linear velocity for   
that.                           

1642
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:20,632
So you can ask any item that    
a dynamic behavior is behaving  

1643
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,534
on, you can ask for             
its linear velocity.            

1644
01:12:24,203 --> 01:12:28,005
Okay now here's all these       
behaviors, gravity behavior,    

1645
01:12:28,074 --> 01:12:29,039
push behavior, all these.       

1646
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:30,840
These are all subclasses        
of a class called               

1647
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:32,642
UI Dynamic Behavior.            

1648
01:12:32,711 --> 01:12:33,709
Not dynamic item behavior.      

1649
01:12:33,778 --> 01:12:34,710
That's the previous slide.      

1650
01:12:34,779 --> 01:12:36,779
This is UIDynamicBehavior.      

1651
01:12:36,848 --> 01:12:39,748
Now a UIDynamicBehavior         
is something you often          

1652
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:42,017
create your own subclass of.    

1653
01:12:42,085 --> 01:12:44,419
Now how that hap,               
you're probably like what?      

1654
01:12:44,488 --> 01:12:46,387
I'm gonna write my              
own gravity thing, or           

1655
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:47,488
my own collision thing?         

1656
01:12:47,556 --> 01:12:49,789
They're too complicated and     
the answer is you're right,     

1657
01:12:49,858 --> 01:12:51,190
it's way too complicated.       

1658
01:12:51,259 --> 01:12:53,859
So your subclasses of           
UI Dynamic behaviour, what      

1659
01:12:53,928 --> 01:12:57,830
they're gonna be is composites  
of other dynamic behaviours.    

1660
01:12:57,898 --> 01:13:02,234
So if you had some space l,     
where there's boundaries and    

1661
01:13:02,302 --> 01:13:04,003
gravity is applying             
to things and                   

1662
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,137
they have a certain             
friction and elasticity.        

1663
01:13:06,206 --> 01:13:07,806
You would combine our           
gravity behaviour,              

1664
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:10,608
collision behaviour and         
UI Dynamic item behaviour.      

1665
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:13,777
Into your subclass of           
UIDynamicBehavior.              

1666
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:16,213
And the way you combine them    
is with this very important     

1667
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:19,549
method in UIDynamicBehavior     
called addChildBehavior.        

1668
01:13:19,618 --> 01:13:23,686
That means composite this       
behavior into my behavior.      

1669
01:13:23,755 --> 01:13:26,656
And, we almost always do this,  
okay?                           

1670
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:29,324
Create our own subclass         
of UIDynamicBehavior, and       

1671
01:13:29,393 --> 01:13:32,327
put all our other behaviors     
that are related in it,         

1672
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:33,295
as child behaviors.             

1673
01:13:33,363 --> 01:13:37,599
It's it's just a good way       
to collect the ff total         

1674
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,401
behavior that's being imparted  
to things into one place.       

1675
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,803
And we're going to do           
that in our demo as well.       

1676
01:13:42,872 --> 01:13:47,941
Most of the code we're          
gonna write on Wednesday        

1677
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:53,079
is gonna be in a big            
UIDynamicBehavior subclass      

1678
01:13:53,148 --> 01:13:59,151
'cuz we're gonna put a lot      
of behavior on our asteroids    

1679
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:05,190
that are moving around they     
gotta bounce off the ship and   

1680
01:14:05,259 --> 01:14:11,097
they gotta be affected by       
the ship's acceleration and     

1681
01:14:11,165 --> 01:14:15,867
all kinds of things we          
gotta put that all in           

1682
01:14:15,936 --> 01:14:20,772
our own subclass                
UIDynamicBehaviour okay?        

1683
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:23,274
Remember I said there's this    
UIDynamic animator at the top,  

1684
01:14:23,343 --> 01:14:24,942
you add all                     
the behaviors to it.            

1685
01:14:25,011 --> 01:14:27,044
That thing, all the behaviors?  

1686
01:14:27,113 --> 01:14:28,278
No, the one they're in.         

1687
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:31,014
They have a var called          
dynamicAnimator, which could    

1688
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,783
be nil, because they might not  
be currently being animated,    

1689
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:36,619
that tells them that.           

1690
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:40,188
They also find out with this    
method will move to dynamic     

1691
01:14:40,257 --> 01:14:43,891
animator every time they're     
either removed from a dynamic   

1692
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,826
animator or                     
added to a different one.       

1693
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:47,828
They can only be                
animated by one.                

1694
01:14:47,896 --> 01:14:49,764
So I think it can never be      
reanimated by multiple dynamic  

1695
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:51,197
animators, that would           
make no sense at all.           

1696
01:14:51,266 --> 01:14:52,865
It'll be fighting each other.   

1697
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:55,468
So this is just time            
the one that they moved to.     

1698
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:57,069
So you can find out             
when they move too.             

1699
01:14:57,138 --> 01:14:58,237
Why do you want to know this,   
by the way?                     

1700
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:00,806
It's sometimes very             
interesting to know when        

1701
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:03,842
you leave a DynamicAnimator,    
okay,                           

1702
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:06,277
because maybe you have          
something else going on,        

1703
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:08,546
like in our demo,               
if we get to it on Wednesday,   

1704
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:11,715
we'll have a little timer       
that's going on all the time.   

1705
01:15:11,784 --> 01:15:13,449
But if we're not                
being animated,                 

1706
01:15:13,518 --> 01:15:14,517
we don't want                   
that timer going.               

1707
01:15:14,586 --> 01:15:15,251
So we'll start and              

1708
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:17,253
stop that timer and             
we'll move to Animator.         

1709
01:15:19,824 --> 01:15:21,589
Okay?                           

1710
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:24,025
UI dynamic behavior also has a  
really cool bar called action.  

1711
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:26,393
Okay.                           

1712
01:15:26,463 --> 01:15:29,163
Action is just a closure,       
takes no arguments,             

1713
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:30,497
returns no arguments.           

1714
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:34,835
This action closure, is called  
every time this behavior acts.  

1715
01:15:36,472 --> 01:15:38,304
Okay, so collision behavior,    

1716
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:40,606
when it collides it's gonna     
call this action thing.         

1717
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:42,407
Gravity is calling this         
thing all the time.             

1718
01:15:42,476 --> 01:15:43,175
Because gravity is              

1719
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:45,243
always accelerating             
the items more and more.        

1720
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:48,145
A push behavior, it's called,   
if it's instantaneous,          

1721
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:49,847
it's called when it             
does its one push.              

1722
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:52,148
If it is continuous, it's       
gonna be called all the time    

1723
01:15:52,217 --> 01:15:54,184
as it pushes on the thing.      

1724
01:15:54,253 --> 01:15:57,420
So this, these little           
closures are called a lot.      

1725
01:15:57,489 --> 01:16:00,823
So don't do anything expensive  
inside an action closer.        

1726
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:01,690
Okay?                           
You want to                     

1727
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:04,693
really make this code when if   
you go into instruments and     

1728
01:16:04,762 --> 01:16:06,895
you look at your code, if you   
do something expensive here it  

1729
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:09,798
will come to the top pretty     
fast because it gets called     

1730
01:16:09,867 --> 01:16:12,366
a lot, as you might imagine.    

1731
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:16,203
And the but you can do a lot    
of really cool things in here.  

1732
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:17,338
this is where you would         
implement your speed limit,     

1733
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,405
For example,                    

1734
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,307
okay check the linear           
velocity, if it's too fast you  

1735
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:25,311
would add some negative linear  
velocity to slow it back down.  

1736
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,945
Okay?                           

1737
01:16:27,014 --> 01:16:29,181
It's really easy to get memory  
cycles with this thing,         

1738
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:32,250
because of course this action   
var is a var in the behavior    

1739
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:34,419
and a lot of times              
inside the closure,             

1740
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:36,620
you're going to be              
referencing the behavior.       

1741
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:38,722
Doing something about           
the behavior, right?            

1742
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,624
So they're gonna point          
to each other right,            

1743
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:41,792
rather directly there.          

1744
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:46,362
Now, another thing that's       
interesting about dynamic       

1745
01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:49,765
animator is it usually,         
most of the time,               

1746
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:52,267
runs to stasis, kay?            

1747
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:53,468
So things are happening like,   
again,                          

1748
01:16:53,537 --> 01:16:54,936
swipe up from the bottom        
of your phone,                  

1749
01:16:55,005 --> 01:16:57,739
the thing,                      
gravity pulls it out,           

1750
01:16:57,807 --> 01:17:00,240
it bounces off the top          
a little, and then it stops.    

1751
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:03,544
And when it stops can           
the animator still on, but      

1752
01:17:03,613 --> 01:17:04,945
has nothing to do?              

1753
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:07,213
You'll get this delegate        
methods sent to you,            

1754
01:17:07,282 --> 01:17:08,648
animator did pause.             

1755
01:17:08,716 --> 01:17:10,849
So now you now, the animator,   
it's still running,             

1756
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,350
it's still looking for          
something to change,            

1757
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,019
but nothing is currently        
changing, so has paused.        

1758
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:16,187
And then if something changes,  

1759
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,489
like you do a push              
behavior and                    

1760
01:17:17,557 --> 01:17:20,123
things start moving again,      
it's gonna say resumed,         

1761
01:17:20,192 --> 01:17:22,092
until everything                
reaches stasis again.           

1762
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:25,762
Now, you don't always reach     
stasis, in our little asteroid  

1763
01:17:25,831 --> 01:17:27,931
space game,                     
it's never gonna reach stasis,  

1764
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:30,900
cuz the asteroids are always    
flying by, constant asteroid    

1765
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:34,103
activity, but in the flip       
up from the bottom, okay,       

1766
01:17:34,172 --> 01:17:36,104
then it does reach stasis so    

1767
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:38,173
if you wanna find out           
when it reaches a stasis,       

1768
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:41,509
you just set yourself as        
the UIDynamicAnimatorDelegate,  

1769
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:44,012
that top level animating        
controller thing, and           

1770
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,947
it'll tell you.                 

1771
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:49,016
Now, let's combine.             

1772
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:49,816
Well, let's go back and         

1773
01:17:49,885 --> 01:17:51,317
fix that problem we             
had with the push.              

1774
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:53,852
Okay, so we have this           
instantaneous push and so       

1775
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:55,121
we do this one push.            

1776
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:57,556
W-, well first of all,          
we create the push behavior.    

1777
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:01,259
We add the items we want to     
push to it just by saying,      

1778
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:04,863
right there, UIPushBehavior     
items put an array of UI        

1779
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:07,331
view that we want to push,      
and then we set the mode.       

1780
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,632
And if we set the mode          
to be inten-,                   

1781
01:18:08,701 --> 01:18:10,334
instantaneous right here.       

1782
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:14,304
Then, when we add this          
behavior to an animator okay,   

1783
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:16,205
cuz we have to add              
it to an animator               

1784
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,241
When we add it to an animator,  
it's gonna push those items.    

1785
01:18:18,242 --> 01:18:20,209
for anything to happen.         

1786
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,911
And then the animator is going  
to continue to have a strong    

1787
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:23,811
pointer to it.                  

1788
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,346
And so it's wasted memory.      

1789
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:26,548
the push behavior is just       
sitting there unused.           

1790
01:18:26,549 --> 01:18:27,682
It's just sitting,              

1791
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,582
It was instantaneous,           

1792
01:18:28,651 --> 01:18:31,484
it already pushed,              
there's nothing to do.          

1793
01:18:31,553 --> 01:18:34,587
So, a lot of times what we'll   
do is we'll use that action     

1794
01:18:34,656 --> 01:18:37,857
thing to have a little closure  
that removes the pushBehavior   

1795
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:38,757
from the animator.              

1796
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:40,125
[LAUGH] Okay?                   

1797
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:42,494
And since we know action        
gets calls right after it's     

1798
01:18:42,562 --> 01:18:45,529
instantaneously pushed, it's    
a perfect time to remove it.    

1799
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,365
However, you can see            
that this creates               

1800
01:18:47,434 --> 01:18:48,999
a horrible memory cycle.        

1801
01:18:49,068 --> 01:18:50,868
Look inside that closure,       
the very first thing we do,     

1802
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:54,338
say pushBehavior that's going   
to capture push behavior.       

1803
01:18:54,407 --> 01:18:55,472
And of course pushBehavior,     

1804
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,540
the action bar is               
on pushBehavior.                

1805
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,041
So that point right             
back to each other,             

1806
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,576
directly to each other,         
keeping each other in memory.   

1807
01:19:01,645 --> 01:19:02,811
So how do we break this cycle?  

1808
01:19:02,879 --> 01:19:05,379
So I bring this example out     
because it shows the way to     

1809
01:19:05,448 --> 01:19:08,215
break a cycle that we haven't   
really shown example of         

1810
01:19:08,284 --> 01:19:11,552
which is to use unowned, okay?  

1811
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,486
We don't need to do             
weak self here, and             

1812
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:16,690
in fact we wouldn't do weak     
self, because we know that      

1813
01:19:16,758 --> 01:19:20,360
inside this closure push        
behavior can never be nil,      

1814
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:22,294
it could never be               
outside the heap,               

1815
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:25,197
because we're in the action     
method that push behavior.      

1816
01:19:25,266 --> 01:19:27,733
The only reason we'd be here    
is because we just pushed with  

1817
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:28,600
that push behavior, so          

1818
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:30,535
it couldn't possibly            
be out of the heap.             

1819
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:32,670
So it's guaranteed              
to be there, so                 

1820
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:34,605
we do not need doing in this    
week or anything about,         

1821
01:19:34,674 --> 01:19:38,141
we can just say unowned, and    
unowned means do not keep       

1822
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,944
the strong pointer inside       
the closure to pushBehavior,    

1823
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:43,347
because I know it's             
gonna be in the heap.           

1824
01:19:44,682 --> 01:19:47,649
You see how unowned             
works there?                    

1825
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:50,352
So unowned is kind              
of more of a force-             

1826
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:52,487
way of breaking                 
a memory cycle.                 

1827
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:54,322
And you gotta be really         
sure that that thing you're     

1828
01:19:54,391 --> 01:19:57,358
gonna mark unowned is in        
fact going to be there,         

1829
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,959
otherwise it will               
crash your app.                 

1830
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,261
But here we know for a fact.    

1831
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,364
All right, that's it.           

1832
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:07,633
On Wednesday I will do          
a gigantic space demo.          

1833
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:11,403
To show you how all this        
stuff works, if I have time,    

1834
01:20:11,472 --> 01:20:14,439
which I almost am certain I     
will not I'll try to work some  

1835
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:17,543
core motion in there which is   
the accelerometer in Gyro and   

1836
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:19,310
that stuff how we               
make that work.                 

1837
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:21,913
There's no Friday section this  
week, next week we're going to  

1838
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:25,516
be doing a lot of stuff         
kind of the general             

1839
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:28,485
how things work in IOS that     
we haven't had a chance         

1840
01:20:28,553 --> 01:20:31,154
to cover like the application   
life-cycle, you know, what      

1841
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:33,923
happens when your application   
launches, runs, quits, etc.     

1842
01:20:33,992 --> 01:20:37,160
And then things like alerts,    
puting alerts up on             

1843
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:38,527
the screen,                     
which you will all need for     

1844
01:20:38,596 --> 01:20:41,162
your final projects, and        
there's a couple more segues.   

1845
01:20:41,231 --> 01:20:43,832
A little more rare              
kind of segues than             

1846
01:20:43,901 --> 01:20:46,234
the show segues                 
that you know about             

1847
01:20:46,303 --> 01:20:48,136
that I'm going to cover         
next week as well.              

1848
01:20:48,204 --> 01:20:50,938
And you probably want all this  
stuff as you're doing your      

1849
01:20:51,007 --> 01:20:52,073
final project.                  

1850
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:53,540
And I'll, so that's why         
I'm going to try and            

1851
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:55,842
cover it all next week so       
you have time.                  

1852
01:20:55,911 --> 01:20:59,346
To get to it before the end,    
alright that's it.
