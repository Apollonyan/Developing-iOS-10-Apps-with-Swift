Applications for                
iOS winter of 2017.             

5
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,513
This is Lecture number 15 and   

6
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:19,182
our only topic                  
today is segues.                

7
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,185
This is the segues lecture.     

8
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:27,522
You've learned show segues and  
show detail segues, which       

9
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,626
work in navigation controllers  
and split view controllers and  

10
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,529
now we're gonna learn all the   
rest of the kinds of segues     

11
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:36,131
that you can use to             
build your application.         

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,066
So let's start                  
with mode segue.                

13
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:41,002
So now a modal segue            
is interesting.                 

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,637
One, you,                       
when you segue modally,         

15
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,972
you take an MVC that            
you're segueing to.             

16
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,941
And it takes over               
the entire screen, okay?        

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,076
That's why it's called modal,   

18
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,745
because you're in a mode        
[LAUGH] where you can only      

19
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,712
interact with that MVC.         

20
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,347
There's no back button.         

21
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,882
There's no tab                  
bar to click on.                

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,250
There's no way to do anything   
else in the app except for      

23
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:01,986
what that MVC is doing.         

24
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,688
Why would you ever              
want to do this?                

25
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,824
Well, sometimes you get to      
a point in your application     

26
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:08,892
where you need some             
information from your user and  

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,627
you just can't                  
proceed without it.             

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,496
So, my example here is, let's   
say I'm in a contacts app,      

29
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:19,134
like the contacts app on your   
phone and you get to a point    

30
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,669
here where you're looking       
through contacts and            

31
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:23,171
you say, "well I want           
to add a contact".              

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,207
Alright, so you're going        
to press this little +          

33
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,475
button in upper                 
right hand corner.              

34
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:29,309
When you do that,               
a whole new MVC,                

35
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:33,714
the add contact MVC slides      
up from the button and          

36
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,249
you notice there's no back      
button there because I'm        

37
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:39,886
not in the navigation pushed    
and instead of a back button,   

38
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:43,222
this one happens to have        
a cancel button right here.     

39
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,824
But there's nothing I can do    
now with this application,      

40
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:47,459
except for                      
what's on this screen.          

41
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:50,895
So, I could fill out            
the field to add a contact,     

42
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:54,265
I could hit cancel or           
done, that's all I can do.      

43
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:57,434
And it's perfectly              
fine to have a modal            

44
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,770
MVC that brings up              
another modal MVC.              

45
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,204
In fact, this one does.         

46
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,606
I'm adding a new                
contact here and                

47
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,708
I'm going to add a photo for    
my contact.                     

48
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:08,010
So I'm gonna click this add     
photo button, right here, and   

49
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:12,181
when I do, another MVC,         
presumably the camera, or       

50
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,248
the photo library, or           

51
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:16,484
the photo choosing MVC,         
comes up on top.                

52
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,019
And again, I can't do anything  
now until I've dealt with this  

53
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:20,788
and, presumably I               
could take a photo,             

54
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,523
that would be one way           
to get out of this.             

55
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,325
Or I could hit cancel so let's  
go ahead and hit cancel in      

56
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,794
this one, when we do that we    
go back to the previous model   

57
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:32,498
one and here if we hit cancel   
on this one we are going to go  

58
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:35,401
back to the original            
one that we had right.          

59
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,403
So it is two order model        
viewer control is it kinda      

60
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:42,107
takes over your app for         
a little bit now,               

61
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,075
you gotta think a little bit    
about modal view controllers.   

62
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,344
They're so easy to put up,      

63
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,046
that they can be                
abused a little bit.            

64
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:53,083
Users tend to be slightly       
disconcerted by modal MVCs.     

65
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,618
Because they get comfortable    
with their app and              

66
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:56,852
they know where the tabs are.   

67
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,221
And they know how               
to go backwards and             

68
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,354
forwards in navigation          
controllers.                    

69
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,289
And then, all of a sudden, all  
they can do is this one thing.  

70
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,625
Now, sometimes it               
makes perfect sense.            

71
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:06,561
Like add contacts of course     
that the user understands I'm   

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,362
adding a contact that           
I can click over and            

73
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,063
do something else.              

74
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,065
Well there are some users       
who might say why can I         

75
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,400
click over do some of           
the things right now?           

76
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,869
I need to do that to add        
these contacts or whatever.     

77
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:20,807
So, I tried to stay away from   
modal view controllers as much  

78
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,208
as possible but things in       
navigation controllers and      

79
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:25,210
tab button controllers,         
and things like that but        

80
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:29,180
there are times, when it's      
absolutely, necessary.          

81
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,583
So how do you set one of        
these modal segways up?         

82
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,650
Super easy.                     

83
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:34,485
You just control-drag.          

84
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,387
And when you control-drag,      
instead of saying show or       

85
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,922
detail, you're going to         
say present modally.            

86
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,592
Now, normally,                  
as with any segway,             

87
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,894
you're going to be segwaying    
from like a bar button item or  

88
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:49,698
just a regular button, or a     
row in a tableview, but if for  

89
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,768
some reason you want to         
put something up module         

90
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,902
from something else             
basically from code.            

91
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,239
You don't forget about          
this method that actually       

92
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,257
in a previous lecture called    
perform segue with identify.    

93
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,208
we're talk about,               

94
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:06,112
You can set up a segue in your  
story board by just control     

95
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,748
dragging from the little        
view controller icon at         

96
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,950
the top of your scene           
that little yellow thing,       

97
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,320
it's at the very top part of    
any scene in your story board.  

98
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,089
In control drag from that,      
to any other MVC,               

99
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,059
set it to be present modal,     
and then inspect that segue.    

100
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,360
Give it an identifier, and      

101
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,827
then call this                  
method in your code.            

102
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,029
It will cause that              
segue to happen, and            

103
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,632
that MVC will appear modally.   

104
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,334
Also, if you happen to have     
a view controller in your       

105
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,269
hand like you have              
a local variable or             

106
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,538
something that has              
a view controller in it,        

107
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,306
which by the way when           
would that ever happen?         

108
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,273
Have we seen that happen?       

109
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,908
I don't think we have yet.      

110
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:43,645
But there are various iOS       
API that will give you back     

111
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:44,812
a view controller.              

112
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,947
Like on Wednesday we're         
gonna talk about alerts and     

113
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:47,714
action sheets.                  

114
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:50,350
They will give you an MVC       
which is basically an alert     

115
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,085
that you're gonna put           
up on the screen.               

116
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,920
Also if you want to take        
a picture with the camera,      

117
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,355
you're gonna get this UI image  
picker controller which is      

118
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:58,224
an MVC and                      
you're gonna put it up.         

119
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,024
And the way you put that up,    
okay,                           

120
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,693
anytime you have an MVC         
in your hand, in a VAR,         

121
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,663
Not in the storyboard but       
in it might be something you    

122
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:08,365
created out of the storyboard   
but it's in your in a bar.      

123
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,367
You just do present.            

124
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,301
So these are both new           
controller methods up           

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,568
here these yellow things.       

126
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:14,504
And present just takes the      
view controller you want to     

127
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:15,905
present, whether                
you wanna animate               

128
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:18,140
it appearing on screen          
which you usually do.           

129
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,641
A and                           
then a completion handler.      

130
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,543
When animations done it'll      
call a completion handler.      

131
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:23,611
Often we just ignore that.      

132
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,312
That's why it defaults          
to nil there, okay.             

133
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:30,250
Now, when you are causing       
this modal thing                

134
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,687
to appear, when it appears,     

135
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:38,925
it can actually appear          
in different forms.             

136
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:41,261
One way is, it can cover        
the entire screen,              

137
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,063
which you're going              
to always see in                

138
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,766
train trade collections where   
it tours on like compact.       

139
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,400
Okay, so that's like iPhone,    
all right,                      

140
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,537
or master maybe of my pad.      

141
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:55,105
In a horizontally compact       
environment it's going          

142
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:57,074
to kind of cover drop           
the whole space.                

143
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,842
But in other places you         
might want it to appear         

144
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,510
as a Popover, okay?             

145
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,379
Or you might even want it       
to appear as kind of a form     

146
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:06,048
sheet, a smaller than           
the huge iPad screen.           

147
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,318
So when you setup your segue,   
you can go and inspect it and   

148
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,854
you can set how you want        
it to appear, okay?             

149
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:15,790
And you can just take a look    
of those prime out, page and    

150
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:20,195
form sheet and see what they    
look like, and see which one.   

151
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,312
that's what it's gonna look     
like when it, it gets there.    

152
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,362
You like there, so              

153
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,833
In horizontally compact         
environments, okay,             

154
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:28,468
they aren't really              
narrow environments,            

155
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:31,771
it's always by default going    
to adapt to full screen,        

156
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,439
no matter what, you put in      
there, but I'm gonna show you,  

157
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,976
hopefully, if we have time in   
the demo, how you can override  

158
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:41,313
that adapting that behavior,    
that automatic adapting         

159
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:46,350
behavior preparing for          
a modal segue, it's             

160
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,719
exactly the same as any other   
segue you've ever seen, right?  

161
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,656
You just check the identifier,  
see if the destination does     

162
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:54,591
the thing you're looking for,   
and then prepare it.            

163
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,228
What about hearing              
back from a Modal MVC?          

164
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,130
So you put a Modal MVC up like  
that contacts thing and it      

165
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,866
collects all the information    
for the new contact.            

166
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,567
How do you communicate back?    

167
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,970
Here's the new contact, okay?   

168
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,137
So, there's a couple            
of things there.                

169
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,173
One, you know, that new         
contact thing might just be     

170
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,241
creating that contact           
in a database.                  

171
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,542
And, and                        
you don't need to do anything.  

172
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,344
You just dismiss the modal      
view controller.                

173
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,947
When it comes back, the other   
view controller is looking in   

174
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,415
the same database, and          
it sees it appear.              

175
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,250
It's probably using a fetch     
results controller or           

176
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,285
something like that, and        
it sees it as it appears and    

177
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:28,386
magically just works, but       
sometimes you might be          

178
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,554
creating something              
where you do need to            

179
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:32,924
communicate back and you're     
gonna use an unwind segway for  

180
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,060
that, and I'm gonna talk about  
unwind in a few slides here.    

181
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,863
But that's how you're going to  
communicate back from a modal   

182
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,431
view controller.                

183
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,798
How do you get the modal        
view controller                 

184
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:44,467
to go way like when you         
hit the cancel button?          

185
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:47,336
The answer is that              
the presenting view controller  

186
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:51,040
the view controller that puts   
it up okay the things you said  

187
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:55,144
way from that thing is          
responsible for dismissing it.  

188
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,880
And it does it with these       
methods dismiss animated,       

189
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:02,617
okay and that when you say      
dismiss to NBC it means         

190
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:06,420
Dismiss any view                
controller I've put up.         

191
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,421
That's what this means, okay?   

192
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,957
Dismiss ones I've put up.       

193
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:12,959
And, the good news is, okay,    
a lot of times you'd wanna do   

194
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,462
this in the cancel button of a  
thing that was presented, but   

195
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,298
of course, you can't            
send this to yourself.          

196
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,366
But luckily,                    
every view controller knows     

197
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:21,500
who presented it.               

198
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,569
So, it can just get its         
presenting view controller.     

199
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,304
There's a, bar called           
presenting view controller,     

200
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,874
and it can send dismiss to its  
presenting view controller.     

201
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,143
You'll see that in              
the demo as well.               

202
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,878
Online segues by the way,       
which again I'm going to talk   

203
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,614
about in a minute,              
they automatically dismiss.     

204
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,249
So, you do not have to call     
dismiss if you unwind.          

205
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,851
To communicate                  
information back.               

206
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:47,256
Now, not only can you control   
what the modal view control     

207
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,690
is going to look                
like when it's up,              

208
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,191
whether it's full screen or     
whatever, but                   

209
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,861
you can also control how        
it animates to come up.         

210
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,130
And it's the same thing we saw  
with the other one, you can     

211
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:00,301
flip to have it appear, it      
can cross this all in there,    

212
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:03,603
you can slide up from the       
bottom that's coverVertical is  

213
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:06,206
the default, and                
you can even partialCurl,       

214
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,941
it will kind of lift it up      
like a piece of paper and       

215
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,476
see the new one in behind.      

216
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,378
In all cases though,            
no matter how animates on,      

217
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:16,915
no matter how are chose, it's   
modal only that new MVC can be  

218
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:20,252
interactive with, okay, the     
other MVC is like the one I     

219
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,121
presented it,                   
are kind temporarily disable.   

220
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,024
All right, let's talk           
about that unwind segue.        

221
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,559
This unwinding,                 

222
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:33,196
is the only segue in iOS that   
does not create a new MVC.      

223
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:36,732
Okay?                           

224
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,167
Show segue, new MVC.            

225
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,002
Popover, new MVC.               

226
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,070
But unwind, does not,           
because in unwind,              

227
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,507
you're segueing back to some    
MVC that already exist.         

228
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:46,775
That has presented you.         

229
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,276
Okay?                           

230
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,978
Now, what's it good for         
this unwind, is it's good for   

231
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,813
communicating back              
from a modal.                   

232
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,549
It's also good if you have      
a navigation controller with    

233
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,150
a whole bunch of things         
on the stack, and               

234
00:09:58,219 --> 00:09:59,986
you want to jump                
back more than one.             

235
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:03,088
You want to do more than one    
back button's worth, you can    

236
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:06,325
jump back three levels, you     
can unwind back up your stack,  

237
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:09,628
because, though, when you       
have a navigation controller,   

238
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,930
all the MVCs, higher on the     
stack are considered to have    

239
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,699
presented you by pushing        
you on the stack, okay?         

240
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:19,603
Which they did, they segued to  
you with a show, or whatever.   

241
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,339
So, that's what unwind          
is mostly good for.             

242
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,372
How does it work?               

243
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:26,509
Well, you don't control         
drag from the button, or        

244
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:30,112
whatever you want to do the     
unwind, to the MVC you want.    

245
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,347
Instead, you're                 
gonna Ctrl+drag                 

246
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,415
to this little orange           
button at the top.              

247
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,549
You've probably seen            
this button and                 

248
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,751
said, mm, what is that thing?   

249
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,187
It has a tooltip that           
says Exit, and, indeed,         

250
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:40,887
that's what you do.             

251
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,188
When you Ctrl+drag              
to this thing,                  

252
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:46,292
you're creating a segue that    
is going to exit this MVC.      

253
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,293
Okay.                           

254
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:49,829
Now, how do you decide where    
you are going to go when        

255
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:50,662
you exit.                       

256
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,364
Well, you are going             
to do that,                     

257
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,132
because you create a special    
method in another MVC.          

258
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,969
And whenever you create this    
special method in any MVC       

259
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,470
it gets added to a list         
inside of X code, and, so       

260
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,607
when you control drag to exit   
that list is going to appear.   

261
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,607
And you can see I only have     

262
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,609
one of them here                
called go back.                 

263
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:10,213
Now, I'm Ctrl+dragging from     
a table view raw, so I've got   

264
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,916
the accessory one, and the      
main table view raw one there.  

265
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:15,150
But go back,                    
there's the only one.           

266
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:17,752
So, when I choose this go       
back, I'm basically saying,     

267
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:21,689
that I wanna segue to some      
MVC that presented me,          

268
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:25,926
it implements the go            
back method, okay?              

269
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,294
That's how unwind work.         

270
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:30,397
Now, let's look at kinda        
how the code behind all         

271
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,365
this works.                     

272
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:37,503
So, in the presenter, the one   
you're gonna unwind to,         

273
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,470
you have to create a method.    

274
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,505
And this method has to          
have two important things.      

275
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,675
One, it has to be               
marked @IBAction.               

276
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,277
And two it argument and         
it can only have one argument,  

277
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,779
it must have one argument, and  

278
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,748
that argument must be of        
type UI storyboard segue,       

279
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:53,784
because you're going to be      
segueing to this thing.         

280
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:56,286
Okay, so that's in the view     
controller you're going         

281
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:58,755
to unwind to,                   
that you're segueing to.        

282
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,658
So, the code for this           
kinda looks like this, and      

283
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,092
to prepare.                     

284
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,129
Of the presenter, so            
the presented I mean.           

285
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:08,363
The prepare,                    

286
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,631
of the thing that's going       
to be doing the unwind,         

287
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,301
because it's going to be        
segueing, it gets to prepare.   

288
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,370
So, it has normal prepare,      
you can check its identifier.   

289
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,971
And when you're in prepare,     

290
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,541
the segue's destination it's    
gonna be the presenter,         

291
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,442
the view controller             
you're gonna unwind to.         

292
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:26,879
So, this code goes in           
the presented view controller,  

293
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,113
the modal view controller,      
whatever,                       

294
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,915
that you're gonna unwind from.  

295
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,383
Then back in the presenter      
you have code that looks like   

296
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,853
this, the special method with   
the at sign app, action,        

297
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,055
ID action and                   
the UI storyboard segue.        

298
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,257
And inside there,               
very interestingly,             

299
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,493
you're gonna look at the        
segue's source you know that    

300
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:46,062
were used to looking a segue    
destination that's the view     

301
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,130
controller we are segueing to.  

302
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,300
Segue source is the source      
of the segue, so                

303
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:54,002
that's the MVC we're            
segueing from, so in            

304
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,038
an unwind situation for in the  
go back method, this go back    

305
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:59,774
method, just go back method     
goes inside the presenter       

306
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:00,708
right there.                    

307
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:04,044
The source of the segue         
is the modal one.               

308
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,445
And when you do unwind,         

309
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:07,881
you will automatically          
get dismissed.                  

310
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,116
See how I disappeared there.    

311
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,050
I'll get dismissed, and         

312
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:16,221
the presenter will have this    
go back special method called,  

313
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,572
So, this,                       
this is how unwind plays out.   

314
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,855
okay?                           

315
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,960
It's all about that special     
method and the presenter.       

316
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:22,827
All right.                      

317
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,961
Another segue is                
the Popover segue.              

318
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,096
I'm sure you've all seen this.  

319
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,366
Here's a Popover, this          
Popover is presenting an MVC,   

320
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,234
which is some kind of           
search for appointment          

321
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:35,738
MVC there in some calendar      
app, or something like that.    

322
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,773
And, so that's the MVC          
that's being presented.         

323
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,775
Now, when you notice when       
this is being presented.        

324
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:43,411
It's in this little white box   
and there's a little triangle.  

325
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,412
See the little tiny             
little triangle there?          

326
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:49,784
It's pointing to the UI         
element that cause the popover  

327
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:50,684
to come up.                     

328
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:53,153
So, that's usually a bar        
button item, or button, but     

329
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:57,357
you can actually point to any   
rectangle in any view, okay.    

330
00:13:57,425 --> 00:14:00,126
So, for example, if you         
had an iBooks like app and      

331
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:02,094
you have text, and you          
double click on a word, and     

332
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:05,030
you hit define it could         
bring up a popover with         

333
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:07,031
a little arrow is pointing at   
the word you are defining,      

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,369
you see?, so it can point       
to anything you want there.     

335
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:15,940
And notice also that the rest   
of the UI is kinda grayed out   

336
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:19,910
a little bit right the stuff    
that is not the MVC that is     

337
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,979
being presented in              
the popovers kinda grayed out,  

338
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:26,182
in fact if you click there you  
will dismiss the popover, so    

339
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,619
this is also a modal,           
a popover is also a modal.      

340
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,255
It only, you can only interact  
with what's in that popover.    

341
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:35,023
If you try to click on          
anything else, it's gonna just  

342
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,960
miss the popover, and end       
exit the modal state, okay?     

343
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:41,396
You've probably noticed this    
from using various iPad apps,   

344
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,065
and by the way, the popover,    
mostly iPad only, but           

345
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,001
not always, you can actually    
do popovers on the iPhone,      

346
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,571
I'll talk a little bit          
about that as well.             

347
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,574
So yeah, popover, just like     
modal, you control drag,        

348
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,576
you're just gonna set its type  
to be popover instead of,       

349
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,477
present modal.                  

350
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,481
When you're preparing for       
a popover,                      

351
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,249
there's a few extra             
things you can do, okay.        

352
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,585
So, all of these                
presentations,                  

353
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,086
anytime you go modal, or you    

354
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,023
even push in the navigation     
controller, these are all       

355
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,892
managed by a class called       
a UI Presentation Controller,   

356
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,327
it controls                     
the presentation of an MVC.     

357
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,063
Now, we're not gonna have time  
to talk about that, you can     

358
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,699
actually build your own         
presentation in folders that    

359
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,001
present MVCs, and               
other ways that you want.       

360
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,169
Pretty rare to do it, but you   
see it sometimes in apps, or    

361
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:30,171
things slide out in             
a certain way, or whatever.     

362
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,641
But, in the popover case,       

363
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,010
we're just gonna                
talk about the,                 

364
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,411
this, presentation control      
a little bit, because there's   

365
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,748
a sub class of it called UI     
PopoverPresentationController.  

366
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:44,418
And it has a few interesting    
bars in it, like, what arrow,   

367
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,788
what direction is the arrow     
from the popover allowed to     

368
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:48,789
point, okay?                    

369
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:51,257
The system automatically        
figures out where to bring      

370
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,925
the popover up, but it will     
try to make the arrow point in  

371
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,828
one of the directions that you  
allow, also this is where this  

372
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:59,231
popover presentation            
controller is a thing where     

373
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,833
you specify the rectangle and   
view that they are should       

374
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:04,502
point at, if it's not pointing  
in a bar button icon, or        

375
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,038
a button, or                    
something like that.            

376
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,540
And where do you                
configure all this              

377
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,675
UIPopoverPresentationContro-    
ller stuff?                     

378
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:14,377
You do it in your prepare,      
when you prepare for            

379
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,946
a popover segue,                
you're going to do that,        

380
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,314
so, the code looks              
kind of like this.              

381
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:21,417
Here's a typical prepare for    
segue that is preparing for     

382
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,318
a popover segue,                
it looks the same,              

383
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,187
all the green is the same       
as any other segue.             

384
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:27,522
But then there's the yellow     
that's different                

385
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,022
I'm creating this               
local variable.                 

386
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,124
I'm calling it PPC, so          
that it fits on my slide,       

387
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:33,060
but that's not a good           
variable name.                  

388
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:36,997
PPC equals VC which is          
the View Controller that I'm    

389
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:40,633
segueing to give me it's        
popover presentation            

390
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:41,734
controller.                     

391
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,336
When I get that popover         
presentation controller, and    

392
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,571
you can go look at              
the documentation for it, but   

393
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,674
one of the things it can do is  
permitted arrow directions is.  

394
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,176
Will let you set the arrow      
directions to right, left,      

395
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,778
right, up, down or here I've    
set it to any, which means      

396
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,849
any, I'll let the arrow point   
in any direction, all right?    

397
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,651
In addition to doing things     
like arrow directions,          

398
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,887
this popover presentation       
controller also has             

399
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,054
a delegate.                     

400
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,989
Now why does it                 
need a delegate?                

401
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,925
Well the delegate is used       
to control this adaptation      

402
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:11,092
behavior.                       

403
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:14,428
Now the popover, when you have  
a popover, you'd like to have   

404
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,264
your storyboard just            
have a popover so               

405
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,466
that when it works on           
an iPad it's nice.              

406
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:21,001
It's in a popover but           
when you're on iPhone,          

407
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,871
especially when you're in       
a horizontally compact          

408
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,805
environment you don't           
want to use a popover.          

409
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:27,173
There's usually                 
not enough room,                

410
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,475
it's just too crowded to put    
a popover in there, instead,    

411
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:31,310
you wanna do this full screen.  

412
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:32,076
And as I said before,           

413
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:34,679
the system will automatically   
adapt to the fact that you're   

414
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,614
in a horizontally               
compact environment, and        

415
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,983
it will make it full            
screen instead.                 

416
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,719
But via this delegate,          
this pop over presentation for  

417
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:44,021
a delegate, you can             
control that adaptation.        

418
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,322
Behavior you can prevent it,    
you can modify it, so           

419
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:49,158
let's talk a little bit         
about how that works.           

420
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:52,328
So this adaptation to the size  
classes let's just look at      

421
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:53,929
the code right off the bat.     

422
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,931
This delegate method of         
the pop over presentation       

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
controller is called adaptive   
presentation style for          

424
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,734
controller trait collection.    

425
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,703
And, what this is               
basically asking is,            

426
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:05,405
I'm about to present this       
controller, the argument        

427
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:08,241
there, in an environment        
with this trait collection.     

428
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,676
Remember trait collections are  
like horizontal size class,     

429
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:12,244
vertical size class.            

430
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:15,448
And, it's asking you to return  
what kind of adaptation         

431
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,648
you want to do?                 

432
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,717
So, you can return none,        
and it will not adapt,          

433
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:21,319
it'll just do it                
like a popover.                 

434
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:24,422
This how you can get a popover  
on your iPhone just implement   

435
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:27,258
this delegate method and        
return none, okay?              

436
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,327
.None, if you do                
that it won't adapt.            

437
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,229
Now you could return            
other things in here like       

438
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:36,666
.fullScreen or .overfullScreen  
and by doing so                 

439
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:39,035
you control how the popover's   
going to look and               

440
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:41,036
adapt to different              
trade collections.              

441
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,672
Okay, hopefully,                
we'll have time for             

442
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:46,541
that in the demo maybe not,     
but we'll see.                  

443
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,711
The other thing you can do,     
which is kinda cool when        

444
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,246
it adapts,                      
is I might have a popover, and  

445
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,048
since popovers don't            
have cancel buttons.            

446
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,616
They don't need                 
cancel buttons,                 

447
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,852
cuz I can touch anywhere        
outside the popover, and        

448
00:18:58,921 --> 00:18:59,585
it cancels it.                  

449
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:02,822
Okay, so I don't need           
a cancel button, but on a,      

450
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:07,359
when it adapts to full          
screen modal on an iPhone,      

451
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:09,728
I do need a cancel button cuz   
I can't click anywhere else.    

452
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,663
It's taken over my              
entire screen, so               

453
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:12,664
I want to put a cancel button.  

454
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,332
So to put a cancel button up    
there, maybe I want to put it   

455
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:18,502
in a navigation controller so   
that I can fit a cancel button  

456
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,938
at the top,                     
a bar button item, right?       

457
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:23,906
I mean, I could put the cancel  
button somewhere inside my      

458
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:26,943
view controller and then just   
take it out when I'm on iPad,   

459
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,578
iPhone, or whatever.            

460
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:31,847
But maybe what I wanna do is    
have it be in the navigation    

461
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,082
bar of a navigation             
controller.                     

462
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:36,150
But again,                      
only when I'm adapting and      

463
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,953
so this will let you that.      

464
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,221
This one called                 
Presentation Controller,        

465
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,790
View Controller for             
adaptive presentation style,    

466
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,893
is saying, what view            
controller should I use         

467
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:49,529
when I adapt to this            
presentation style?             

468
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay, and that presentation     
style over full screen or       

469
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,069
pop over or full screen.        

470
00:19:57,138 --> 00:20:00,072
And so here is where you        
might want to say I'm gonna     

471
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:03,843
return a navigation controller  
with the controller that        

472
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,411
would normally disappear        
in a pop over inside of it      

473
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,279
as it's root view controller.   

474
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,548
Okay, so this is kind of        
a cool way to do substitute,    

475
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,284
another, like, usually          
a navigation controller,        

476
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:16,220
another MVC that you'll         
wrap around the MVC you're      

477
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,688
trying to present.              

478
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,355
So the return values            
of this is actually             

479
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:20,357
another ViewController.         

480
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,526
Okay, so it's kinda fun         
controlling that adaption       

481
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:27,195
stuff, there's another          
important issue about popovers  

482
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,498
by the way, which is size.      

483
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:30,699
Now, by default,                

484
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:34,902
a Popover comes in size         
that kind of is like            

485
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,872
an iPhone in portrait, that's   
kind of it's default size.      

486
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:42,141
And if it doesn't really know   
what size the stuff is inside,  

487
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,543
that's the best it can do.      

488
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:46,145
But you can control their       
size, make it a lot better,     

489
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:49,449
by having the MVC that's being  
presented, implement, or        

490
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:52,418
set, this var called            
preferred content size.         

491
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,119
And that just says,             
this is the size I want to be   

492
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,588
in a popover, basically or      
in any environment, really.     

493
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:01,125
But this is my preferred        
size to be and                  

494
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:05,062
so, again if we have time can   
do this in our demo as well.    

495
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,097
You want to return              
here the smallest size          

496
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,899
that you look good in and then  
when your popover comes up,     

497
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,800
it'll use this size.            

498
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,734
If you don't set this size,     

499
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,603
you're gonna kind of            
get this default size,          

500
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,103
it depends on                   
whether in portrait,            

501
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,673
landscape, iPad, whatever.      

502
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,609
It's gonna give you             
a somewhat standardized size.   

503
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:25,112
Okay the last segue we're       
going to talk about here is     

504
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:29,616
embed segues, these are really  
cool, really powerful.          

505
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:33,353
Segues is basically a segue     
where you put another aVCs      

506
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:37,723
self.view it's top of a view    
inside another view hierarchy,  

507
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:41,294
so this embedding view          
controllers inside another      

508
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:42,728
view controllers.               

509
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,830
Okay really cool thing          
to be able to do and            

510
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,397
Xcode makes this super easy,    

511
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:49,033
you're just gonna go down       
to your object palate.          

512
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:50,535
And look for                    
container view and              

513
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,337
drag that container view out,   
it looks just like a view.      

514
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:56,473
You're gonna put auto layout    
on it, wherever you want and    

515
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,476
itself.view is gonna appear     
embedded in the view hierarchy  

516
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,144
of the thing you                
dragged it into.                

517
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:03,313
It's really quite               
a normal segue,                 

518
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:05,915
it seems weird cuz it's like    
you're embedding this thing     

519
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:07,816
but, it's a fairly              
normal seque in there.          

520
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:11,052
You can name it,                
you get to prepare for          

521
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,321
seque and all that stuff.       

522
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,322
You can see here,               

523
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,557
the little gray thing           
next to this container,         

524
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,527
that's the view                 
appearing inside the big        

525
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,196
light blue view                 
hierarchy on the left.          

526
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:26,632
And on the right is just        
an entire NVC that you get to   

527
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:30,970
configure any class you want,   
any UI you wanna put in there.  

528
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,740
And that's all just gonna       
appear inside that box on       

529
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,709
the blue side, okay?            

530
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,544
One thing to be really          
careful about embed segues,     

531
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:41,879
it's no different               
than any other segue,           

532
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:43,414
in that when it happens,.       

533
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:47,017
When the prepare happens, none  
of the outlets are set In that  

534
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:49,019
MBC that you're embedded okay?  

535
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,987
So a lot of times people        
they're embedding this other    

536
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:52,789
MBC and they want to be         
setting all kinds of outlet     

537
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,056
in the thing                    
they're embedding.              

538
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,491
But you can't because none of   
those outlets have been set,    

539
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,360
you're in prepare,              
you're really early.            

540
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,930
So almost always what we do     
here is we grab the entire MBC  

541
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,864
and prepare and hold on to it.  

542
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:07,401
And then later in our view did  
load when all valve is loaded   

543
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,303
then do we start                
talking MBC and                 

544
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:12,272
tell it to you know set         
its outlets or whatever.        

545
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,008
So 90% of the time              
in the prepare for              

546
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:18,611
an embed segue we grab on to    
the MVC that we're embedding    

547
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,414
okay which is just going to be  
the segue's destination right?  

548
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,616
That's the seg that's           
the MBC we're segueing to.      

549
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:27,787
Now I'm gonna do all demo       
the rest of the way here, so    

550
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:29,787
I'm gonna give you a little     
what's coming up here.          

551
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,756
So on Wednesday i'm gonna       
be talking about alerts and     

552
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:35,159
action seats sheets and         
also notifications and          

553
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,426
the application life cycle.     

554
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:40,531
So the application life         
cycle's all those methods in.   

555
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,100
Next week, on Monday is         
the Accessibility lecture.      

556
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,770
Also Monday,                    
slides are due if you want to   

557
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,304
participate in                  
the alternate final.            

558
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,505
You have to submit              
them by Monday,                 

559
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,406
if you don't submit             
them by Monday, sorry,          

560
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:52,607
you can't do                    
the alternate final.            

561
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,774
But then that's                 
the only thing you do,          

562
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,209
you don't have to sign up or    
anything.                       

563
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,845
Just submit your                
slides by Monday and            

564
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:02,182
then Wednesday will be          
the alternate final.            

565
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,086
So, the demo I'm gonna do       
right now is we're gonna take   

566
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,086
FaceIt and                      

567
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,923
we're going to add all four     
of those segue Ways to it.      

568
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,457
Okay, all the I just            
talked about we're gonna        

569
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:14,660
put them all in there           
in one little app here.         

570
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:18,630
So, let's go over to faces,     
there's faces.                  

571
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,799
All right, so                   
you guys remember faces,        

572
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,233
very simple little app.         

573
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:25,069
It had this little emotions     
view controller and             

574
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:27,236
we had three emotions,          
sad, happy, and worried.        

575
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:28,138
And when we clicked on it,      

576
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:31,174
it would show a face            
that showed that emotion.       

577
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:36,545
So, I'm gonna actually before   
I dive into these segues,       

578
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:41,383
kind of enhance this            
whole app slightly.             

579
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:44,052
remember when we did our face   
view controller way back when?  

580
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,653
One thing is,                   

581
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:51,725
And we wanted to do squinting,  
but we couldn't do squinting.   

582
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:52,459
Remember why?                   

583
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:54,828
Because our face view only      
could do eyes open or           

584
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:55,796
eyes closed.                    

585
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:58,664
So we didn't really have        
an option to do squinting,      

586
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:00,767
so we just kinda had this,      
okay,                           

587
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,568
well, we'll just                
say that is your.               

588
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,903
Okay, we had the punt,          
essentially.                    

589
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:06,838
So, I'm gonna make it, so       
we don't have to punt.          

590
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:07,572
What I'm gonna do is,           

591
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,675
remember we did that blinking   
face view controller?           

592
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:12,910
I'm gonna make squinting        
be blinking, okay?              

593
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,245
Squinting and blinking          
aren't the same thing,          

594
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,981
but kind of like                
repeatedly squinting.           

595
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,316
So, we're gonna make it so      

596
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,884
that works, so                  
how are we gonna do that?       

597
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,385
We no longer have               
to punt here, so                

598
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:27,890
we'll just not do anything if   
someone says squinting, and     

599
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,760
you remember that all of our    
blinking code is in this        

600
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:35,463
subclass here blinking          
a face view controller.         

601
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:39,033
So, we'll go ahead and make     
our update UI overridable and   

602
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:42,403
we'll go to our blinking face   
view controller here and        

603
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:46,339
override it, so I'm just        
gonna override update UI.       

604
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:51,244
Of course I wanna call funk or  
a funk update UI,               

605
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:54,614
and of course I wanna call      
my supers update UI, so that    

606
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:58,884
the mouth and other stuff and   
the eyes themselves can all.    

607
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,286
then I'm gonna say that         
my blinking, whether or         

608
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:01,620
Be set.                         
But                             

609
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:05,790
not I'm blinking,               
is equal to our model,          

610
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,325
which is our expressions.       

611
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:08,492
Eyes.                           

612
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:11,395
If those are equal              
to squinting.                   

613
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,831
So, if we're squinting,         
then I'm gonna be blinking.     

614
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,566
Everybody see                   
what I did there?               

615
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:19,702
So that's it, I just [LAUGH]    
upgraded blanking face for      

616
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,153
now if you set your model       
to have squinting, as your,     

617
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,536
your controller,                

618
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:24,406
as part of your                 
model,then it will blink.       

619
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,875
Now, we made this               

620
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,810
blink view controller           
kind of a demo thing.           

621
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,111
I made it every time it         
appears it starts blinking.     

622
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,146
Every time it disappears        
it stops blinking.              

623
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,147
I don't really want that now.   

624
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,883
Now, I want it to blink         
when it's squinting and         

625
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,050
not otherwise but               

626
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,988
I also still only want it to    
blink when I'm on screen.       

627
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:45,290
I don't want my timer blinking  
when I'm not even up here.      

628
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,361
So, I'm gonna change this       
blinking thing here to can      

629
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,313
So, let's add a new             
private var up here,            

630
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:53,197
blink.                          

631
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:56,800
can blink start out as false.   

632
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:59,336
And so here if I appear,        
I'll say I can blink and        

633
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:02,038
even say blink if needed        
at this point because maybe     

634
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:04,874
someone set us to blinking      
while we weren't there and      

635
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:07,710
when we disappear I'm gonna     
say can blink was false so      

636
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,178
I'm not allowed to blink.       

637
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:14,916
And then, in blink if needed    
I'll just say If I'm blinking,  

638
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:20,289
and I can blink, then I'll      
go ahead and do my blinking.    

639
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:24,893
One other little thing that     
I want to do here is to not,    

640
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,662
if I'm in the middle of         
a blink, okay, this timer,      

641
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,630
and I get another               
request to blink,               

642
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,431
I don't want to                 
start another timer.            

643
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,634
Okay, so I'm gonna have         
another private var var here    

644
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:37,537
which I'm gonna call in         
a blink which is whether I'm    

645
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:40,607
in the middle of a blink,       
let's start that as false.      

646
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:47,713
And, so I'll also check it      
here and we're not in a blink.  

647
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:51,550
So, then I'll just set          
a blank here to true and        

648
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:55,086
then when we get out the other  
side down here I'll set in      

649
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:57,321
a blank to false.               

650
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,490
So, all I did was upgrade       
my blank view controller,       

651
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,093
so be able to be controlled     
by it's model rather then       

652
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,527
being a demo thing.             

653
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,863
Everybody cool with             
what I did there?               

654
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,197
Minor little upgrade.           

655
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,499
Now the next thing              
I wanna do is.                  

656
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:11,567
What we're gonna do for         

657
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:15,204
our demo segues is, we're       
gonna, if you remember in the.  

658
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:17,605
Self question mark here.        

659
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:24,144
If you remember in              
our storyboard here.            

660
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:27,413
We're kind of fixed to these    
three different emotions,       

661
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:28,514
that's all we have.             

662
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,481
Well, I'm gonna make it so      

663
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,452
that we can hit an add button,  
and add another emotion.        

664
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,387
Okay, as many                   
emotions as we want,            

665
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,154
that's what we're gonna do.     

666
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,989
So, we're gonna have a modal    
segue to that theme,            

667
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:39,323
we'll unwind to bring it back.  

668
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:40,858
We'll make it                   
work on pop over,               

669
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,893
we'll embed the little          
blinking face view.             

670
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,761
We're gonna do all kinds        
of segue stuff here.            

671
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,764
But first we have to convert    
this to something that we can   

672
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,631
add more to.                    

673
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,233
So, we can't have this          
three buttons like this,        

674
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:52,701
basically not going to work.    

675
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,936
So, we need a different kind.   

676
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:57,071
And what I'm gonna do is I'm    
gonna use, there's not much     

677
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,107
code in this emotions           
view controller as it is.       

678
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,108
It just got this.               

679
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,177
Little dictionary of            
the three things, and           

680
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,311
then it does prepare.           

681
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,813
So, I'll keep as much           
code as I can here.             

682
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:08,381
So, but what I'm gonna          
do is make it a table           

683
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:09,648
ViewController.                 

684
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:11,416
Okay, so I'm just gonna turn    
this emotions thing into a      

685
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,685
table ViewController, cuz it's  
real easy to add more rows.     

686
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,754
So, I'm just gonna say, this    
is a UITableViewController      

687
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:20,024
instead and                     
I'm gonna have to change        

688
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,794
my model a little bit here,     
from being a dictionary.        

689
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,330
I'm just gonna have it be       
an array of tuples, where this  

690
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,067
name of the emotion, and then   
the expression are in a tuple.  

691
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,335
And we'll have it in            
an array like that, so          

692
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,904
I'm just gonna replace this     
whole thing with an array.      

693
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:38,307
Of tuples but otherwise         
it's the same exact data.       

694
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,109
It's just this it's             
an array of tuples or           

695
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,512
one thing is the name           
like sad, happy and             

696
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,681
the other is the expression,    
the eyes and mouth whatever.    

697
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,050
Since I've also                 
made this a var, so             

698
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,053
that we can add more of         
them to it over time.           

699
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:56,390
Okay, now, we of course,        
this broke our prepare, but     

700
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,224
we'll fix that in a second.     

701
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,993
Let's go back to our            
storyboard and add this thing.  

702
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:02,628
So, I'm gonna make              
a table view, so                

703
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:04,562
let's go over here to           
utilities windows, and          

704
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,364
grab ourselves a table          
view controller, and            

705
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:07,465
put it out here.                

706
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:08,699
Here's our table view.          

707
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,802
Of course I wanna set this      
identity to be this emotions    

708
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:15,072
view controller which I can     
do because I changed it to be   

709
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,040
And then, raise it to make      
it back to being th root        

710
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,941
a table view.                   

711
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,577
view controller of this         
navigation controller.          

712
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:24,613
Look that up, and remember we   
had these three segues that     

713
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:26,981
would segue from those three    
separate buttons over here.     

714
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,483
Well, I still am                
gonna need the segue,           

715
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:30,685
cuz I gotta show the emotion.   

716
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,554
So, I'm just gonna Ctrl         
drag over to here, and          

717
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,554
create a new segue.             

718
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,757
I'm gonna split through here,   
so it's gonna be show detail.   

719
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:41,160
And we'll call this one         
right here, this segue.         

720
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:43,096
How about show emotion?         

721
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:43,996
That's what it does, right?     

722
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:47,599
It shows an emotion             
when you click on it.           

723
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,301
And, we'll wanna configure      
this table view,                

724
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,503
as well right here.             

725
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:54,238
We'll have the cells            
be just basic.                  

726
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:56,307
One piece of text in there,     
that's be like happy or         

727
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,342
sad, or whatever.               

728
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,510
And we'll have reused           
identifier would be like        

729
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:01,845
emotion cell.                   

730
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:03,346
Let's say.                      

731
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:06,449
Okay, everybody                 
cool with all that?             

732
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:09,117
Maybe we'll even put the title  
we have this title if you       

733
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:13,855
remember in motions the name    
of that table right there.      

734
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:17,425
So that's all that we           
need to do to fix our UI.       

735
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:20,228
So, we just need to fix our     
motions view controller to be   

736
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,495
a table view                    
controller now and              

737
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:24,364
set this old, kind of           
thing that it was before.       

738
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:27,134
So, let's go ahead and          
fix this navigation first.      

739
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:29,970
Remember in that case we        
were using the identifier of    

740
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,004
the segue to figure out         
whether we were sad,            

741
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,139
happy or whatever.              

742
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,440
In this case we're just         
gonna look at the row and       

743
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,911
index it into our nice,         
new model up here.              

744
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,048
So, we can get rid of this let  
identifier equals identifier.   

745
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,849
And clearly, we're not getting  
the expression using that       

746
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:47,118
dictionary anymore.             

747
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:49,352
So, everyone                    
remembers table view?           

748
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:52,055
We just wanna get the cell, so  
we're gonna let the cell equal  

749
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:55,192
the sender as a UI              
table view cell.                

750
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,329
And then, we wanna get          
the index path of that cell so  

751
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:01,163
we know which row it is.        

752
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:03,131
So, we're gonna say             
let index path.                 

753
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,666
Equal the table view.           

754
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:10,138
Index, path for the cell.       

755
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:13,407
Okay, so long as we're able     
to get that indexPath out of    

756
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,942
there, then setting             
the expression                  

757
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,078
in our faceViewController       
is really easy.                 

758
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:21,247
It's just going to be our       
model, emotionalFaces           

759
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:25,818
indexPath.row and here,         
we want the expression, right?  

760
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:28,820
We want this part               
of the tuple.                   

761
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:31,557
Okay, similarly for saving      
the title, we're not coming     

762
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,392
from a button anymore, we're    
coming from table view row.     

763
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:37,829
So we want to do the same       
thing but we want the name,     

764
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:39,264
cut to this topol.              

765
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:42,165
Okay, that's all we             
have to do there,               

766
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,034
that was easy to convert,       
everybody cool?                 

767
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,303
So, now we've got               
navigation working.             

768
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:50,205
What's the most important       
thing we need to do in a table  

769
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:51,339
view to get it working?         

770
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:56,912
We need to implement its        
UITableViewDataSource, right?   

771
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,581
Get the data in the table.      

772
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,784
Super simple on this ca, case   
we haven't seen numberofrows    

773
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:06,987
and section,                    
that's just going to return     

774
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,057
our emotional faces             
of their account.               

775
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,958
However many of these           
emotional faces that we have    

776
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:15,328
up here and then we need        
cell for row and index path.    

777
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:19,531
That's also easy, we'll         
get the cell by dequeing,       

778
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,001
dequeueReusableCell(with        
identifyer.                     

779
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,973
We called it emotion cell, I    
think, there's the index class  

780
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,777
and we would have the cells     
text label text equal           

781
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:35,947
the emotion faces name          
right index path row.           

782
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:39,016
The name that's the name and    
puppies are whatever and        

783
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:42,285
when we return this, so better  
if we just converge this to     

784
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,622
your table view was easy hope   
all of you your super familiar  

785
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,957
with table view.                

786
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,625
After all this so               
let's go ahead and run and      

787
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,062
make sure that we've got        
our new upgraded version of     

788
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,398
this emotions thing working     
well, we didn't forget          

789
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,835
some identifier somewhere or    
something like that.            

790
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,339
Okay, here we go here's         
our app, here's our three       

791
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:07,408
things in our table view,       
that's looking good so far.     

792
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:11,311
Let's click on one that         
looks sad that looks happy,     

793
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380
okay, we've converted           
our thing nicely, so            

794
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:16,282
now we're gonna dive            
into these segues.              

795
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:19,319
The first we're gonna do        
is add a button up here         

796
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:22,321
which is gonna do a modal       
segue to bring up               

797
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,657
an emotion editing gear         
controller, something that      

798
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:29,194
lets us create a new one        
of these emotions, okay?        

799
00:34:29,263 --> 00:34:31,662
So it's gonna have to let us    
specify the name like sad,      

800
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:32,663
happy or worried and            

801
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:34,632
this is gonna have to list      
best by the mouth and           

802
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,333
the eyes, okay?                 

803
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:38,569
And that's all it's gonna do,   
all right,                      

804
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,537
so, how do we do that?          

805
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:45,808
Let's go back to                
our story board and             

806
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,911
we need to drag out the story   
board that is going to be       

807
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,547
this mo- modal                  
view controller.                

808
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:53,548
didn't get a chance to do       
this earlier in the quarter,    

809
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,481
Just because I                  

810
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:58,352
I'm gonna make the UI for this  
thing be a static table view.   

811
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,120
Right, we've done               
dynamic table views, but        

812
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,121
we haven't done a static one.   

813
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,222
So, let's go ahead and          
do a static one, so             

814
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,757
I'm gonna drag                  
out a table view.               

815
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:07,994
Here it is, right here and,     
I'm going to make it static,    

816
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:10,495
so I'm gonna click on           
the table view in here, and     

817
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:15,000
change it from being content    
dynamic to content static.      

818
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,603
By the way, didn't I really     
talk about this, I should of,   

819
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:18,603
I suppose.                      

820
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:22,373
But, how do you define how      
many rows there are in          

821
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,075
a static table, okay?           

822
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:27,478
You're gonna hold control       
shift and click on the table,   

823
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:30,814
so that you can drill           
down to what you want.          

824
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:31,982
You don't want the controller,  

825
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,984
you don't want the table view,  
you want the section okay,      

826
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:38,221
because, in a static table you  
could have multiple sections.   

827
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:40,355
You wanna be able to            
edit a certain section,         

828
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:42,558
you click on that,              
now it's selected.              

829
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,459
And so in the Inspector         
Table View section,             

830
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,895
you see rows, and I can         
change this to be 4 rows.       

831
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:49,563
Now, why do I need 4 rows?      

832
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,000
Well, I need the name, I need   
the eyes, I need the mouth and  

833
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,569
also I'm gonna have one row     
which is a a preview of what    

834
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,704
the face is gonna look like,    
okay?                           

835
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:00,239
So as you can see, as you're    
choosing your eyes and mouth,   

836
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,640
what you are actually doing,    
so                              

837
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,008
that's why you need four rows.  

838
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,542
You can also put headers and    
footers in here, but            

839
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:06,077
I actually am going to          
leave this in plain style.      

840
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:08,546
And not have any headers and    
footers cuz they kind of,       

841
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:10,414
doesn't need any headers and    
footers.                        

842
00:36:10,483 --> 00:36:13,517
All these four                  
rows go together.               

843
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:17,888
Okay, so we don't need to do    
that, we of course are going    

844
00:36:17,957 --> 00:36:22,726
to need a subclass of UI        
table view controller           

845
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,595
to control this MVC, so let's   
go ahead and create that.       

846
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,134
The subclass of                 
UI Tableview controller.        

847
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:34,136
Now this is an interesting      
naming thing,                   

848
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:36,237
right here,                     
I'm gonna call this my          

849
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,773
ExpressionEditorViewControl-    
ler.                            

850
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,042
Notice I'm not calling it my    

851
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:44,310
ExpressionEditorTableViewCont-  
roller.                         

852
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:47,513
This is purely and art of       
programming thing I tend to     

853
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:53,018
not name my static table views  
with the word table in there.   

854
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,687
And the reason for that is I'm  
mostly using static table here  

855
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,923
just to help me layout the UI.  

856
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,826
I'm not using it's table        
viewness very much.             

857
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:03,861
Okay, like I would to be        
with dynamic rose so,           

858
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,696
I tend to not but               
the word table it's up to you.  

859
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,931
You can certainly called        
a expression editor table view  

860
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,099
if you wanted                   

861
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,535
I like my expression editor     
view controller but do you      

862
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,469
understand why I'm calling      
expression editor, right?       

863
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,437
Because it's going to           
edit an expression,             

864
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:16,839
a facial expression here.       

865
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,206
We'll put it in                 
the same place,                 

866
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:21,343
we'd put everything else,       
here it is,                     

867
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:25,113
I'm gonna clean out all         
this stuff right here.          

868
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:28,449
I don't need any of this,       
table view data source stuff,   

869
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,117
because this is a static cell.  

870
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:33,220
I'm not gonna allow deletion,   
or anything like that,          

871
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,989
we're not gonna be Doing        
navigation out of it, so        

872
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:38,458
we have this nice empty         
expression editor.              

873
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:42,094
And let's make sure that in     
our story board that we go and  

874
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:45,531
change the identity of this     
guy to be this expression       

875
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,168
editor otherwise won't be able  
to wire up any outlets or       

876
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,803
any things like that.           

877
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:55,673
Okay, let's start,              
before we build our UI for      

878
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:58,309
this, let's just put            
a cancel button in here and     

879
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,278
get this modal segue going,     
so let's do the modal segue.    

880
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,414
We're gonna modal segue         
from this emotions,             

881
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,283
this is where all our emotions  
are, sad, happy, etc.           

882
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,818
I'm gonna put a little bar      
button item in there, so        

883
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,486
I'm gonna search for            
bar button item there it is,    

884
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,388
I'm gonna drag it up here.      

885
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,091
When I inspect it, there's      
actually some pre-canned bar    

886
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,027
button items for common things  
you want to do like add,        

887
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:21,328
which is what we're gonna do,   

888
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:24,432
cancel, redo,                   
all these things.               

889
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,967
You can pick these and          
they'll have standard icon,     

890
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:30,104
standard words and So in here   
we are adding an emotion so     

891
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:32,239
I'm gonna hit add,              
happens to be a plus sign.      

892
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:35,842
And I'm just going to ctrl      
drag from that to my new        

893
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:38,544
editing view controller and     
I'm not gonna do show or        

894
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:42,080
show detail,                    
I'm gonna do present modally.   

895
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:44,649
Okay that's going to take       
over the whole screen and       

896
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:46,184
put this MBC up and             

897
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:50,655
allow me to add a new           
emotion or whatever in here.    

898
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,257
Now, how do we                  
get out of this?                

899
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:58,027
If either run this right now,   
we'll see that it               

900
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:01,964
works in a manner of speaking   
but it really kind of kills my  

901
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,734
whole app, my app would be      
dead it seems like do that,     

902
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,036
let's go here this              
is working fine.                

903
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:12,074
I click on this plus, this      
thing comes up, I'm dead now.   

904
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,209
There's nothing I can do,       
I can't get out of here.        

905
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:15,410
This has taken over my app and  

906
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,245
I haven't provided any way      
to get out of it, okay?         

907
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,147
So let's start by               
adding a cancel button,         

908
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:22,482
we're just gonna make it so     
we can cancel out of this.      

909
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:25,085
I'm gonna put it as a bar       
button item in a navigation     

910
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,753
controller so                   
I'm gonna pick this thing and   

911
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:29,823
say embed in                    
navigation controller.          

912
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:34,960
Okay, so I put this in          
the navigation controller, so   

913
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:37,428
now I can put up on top         
of here a cancel button.        

914
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:38,529
I'm going to put                
it on the left,                 

915
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,631
it's another bar button item.   

916
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,235
There happens to be a standard  
one for that as well; cancel    

917
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:47,671
and how do I make this          
cancel button work?             

918
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,339
How do I make it                
actually cancel?                

919
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:52,275
Well, this is where I do        
the dismiss, so, let's wire     

920
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:56,813
this up, target action to a     
method that does the dismiss.   

921
00:39:56,882 --> 00:39:58,280
So, let's go into               
automatic mode, here,           

922
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:00,649
we've got our new expression    
editor view controller.         

923
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:04,519
I'm gonna control drag from     
the cancel button over here.    

924
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:06,488
Do an action okay, borrow but   

925
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:10,391
an items in the argument and    
I'm gonna call this cancel.     

926
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Of course, and                  
it's going to cancel.           

927
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:14,261
And in here,                    
I need to dismiss.              

928
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,230
But remember, I can't send      
dismiss to myself, dismiss is   

929
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,666
a view controller thing but     
I can't dismiss myself.         

930
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:23,436
I have to send it to my         
presenting view controller.     

931
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,938
So all view controllers know    
who presented them, if any.     

932
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,206
It could be nil, okay,          

933
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:30,075
you might not have been         
presented by another one.       

934
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:31,809
I'm just gonna ask my           
presenting view controller,     

935
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:36,481
please dismiss whoever you've   
presented, which is me.         

936
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,649
And yes,                        
please do it animated.          

937
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:42,019
And I don't need to find out    
when it's finished dismissing,  

938
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,153
so I'll just leave that off.    

939
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,773
So now, if we run and           
we go here and hit the plus,    

940
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:48,257
Okay?                           

941
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,292
comes up here is                
our table view.                 

942
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:51,960
We haven't done a UI yet but    

943
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,063
if we cancel we goes back       
into dismisses us, okay?        

944
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,564
So we're in good shape.         

945
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:58,866
So now let's go ahead and       
do RUY,                         

946
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:02,303
let's go back to our            
storyboard here.                

947
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:05,872
And add RUI for these four      
things, again we want the name  

948
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:09,209
like sad happy whatever,        
we want a little preview face,  

949
00:41:09,278 --> 00:41:11,077
and then we want the eyes and   
the mouth.                      

950
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:13,378
So I'm just gonna start         
dragging this stuff out and     

951
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:16,215
we'll start working on making   
it look good over time.         

952
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:19,184
So for the name obviously       
I'll need a text field so       

953
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:21,986
I'm just gonna drag that out    
and notice all these cells      

954
00:41:22,055 --> 00:41:24,488
are of type if you look         
at the cell types here,         

955
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:25,522
they're all custom cells.       

956
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,392
Because I'm gonna be putting    
custom UI in each of them.      

957
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:29,927
We're gonna configure           
that in a second.               

958
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:37,633
What about here in our          
little face view thing.         

959
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:39,235
What are we gonna do            
to show our face?               

960
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:44,906
Well, I'm gonna start by        
doing a face view ui view.      

961
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,875
Yeah, let's put a generic       
UI view in here.                

962
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,279
I'll even put some nice auto    
layout in here on this one,     

963
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:53,915
is that it, yeah,               

964
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:57,017
and we'll do reset to           
suggested constraints,          

965
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:59,052
check out constraints to        
make sure it looks good.        

966
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,320
Yeah, that looks good to me.    

967
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:03,389
We'll inspect the identify and  
make it be a face view so       

968
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,924
we get a nice face in there.    

969
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,191
So that's a good face.          

970
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,325
So we have text field face.     

971
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,294
What about for eyes and mouth?  

972
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,463
How are we gonna set            
our eyes and mouth?             

973
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:13,263
I'm gonna use something         
that something that             

974
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:16,733
I haven't shown you yet,        
which is a segmented control.   

975
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:19,269
So segmented control            
looks like this.                

976
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:22,572
Okay, we'll drag one in here,   
drag one in here as well.       

977
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,240
And a segmented control lets    
you choose from a number of     

978
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,044
items up to maybe four or five  
like a fixed number of items.   

979
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,311
So that's perfect for           
our eyes and                    

980
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,746
mouth cuz we have three         
kinds of eyes positions and     

981
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,315
five kinds of, of mouth.        

982
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:34,915
And when you inspect            
it right here,                  

983
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:36,984
you can say how many            
different choices you want.     

984
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:40,854
So for eyes we want three       
segments, and here for          

985
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:42,156
the mouth we're                 
gonna need five.                

986
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:44,590
Okay, right frown, smile,       

987
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:46,292
smirk, grin,                    
neutral, whatever.              

988
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:48,993
And then you can                
just edit these,                

989
00:42:49,062 --> 00:42:49,994
you just double-click on them.  

990
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:55,299
So here let's say eyes open     
here we'll say eyes closed      

991
00:42:55,368 --> 00:43:00,337
and, of course, our favorite    
one which is squinting.         

992
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:07,511
And then down here              
we'll have frown and            

993
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,616
smirk and oops sorry, neutral.  

994
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:18,021
And what to grin I think,       

995
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,424
then we add smile.              

996
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,791
Okay, so there's our UI.        

997
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,093
So we want to make some of      
these things look a little      

998
00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:27,529
better like this text field     
right here there's quite a few  

999
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,131
things we want to set           
about this text field.          

1000
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,666
One thing is we really          
don't need a little border.     

1001
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,001
I zoom way in so                
you can see here.               

1002
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,236
We don't really need            
this border around.             

1003
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:37,871
It's in a text field row, so    

1004
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,505
that's kind of                  
it's own border.                

1005
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:42,008
So we're gonna go down          
here and say border off so      

1006
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,342
it's not gonna                  
have any border.                

1007
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:45,210
Also I want the font to         
be quite a bit larger,          

1008
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,712
let's say 24 point              
would be good.                  

1009
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,881
We'll have it be centered,      
the text will be centered.      

1010
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,617
There's no reason to have       
it left or right aligned.       

1011
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:55,620
Let's use place holder text,    
that's really cool.             

1012
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:58,789
I'm gonna put name in here      
as the Placeholder text.        

1013
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:01,791
That way I don't need to label  
on the left that says name,     

1014
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,926
this is the name                
of this emotion.                

1015
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:04,226
I'll just put this              
placeholder there,              

1016
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:05,495
it'll be obvious to users.      

1017
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:06,462
That's the name.                

1018
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,865
And so they'll just click       
there, and start typing.        

1019
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:12,267
And, also, for the keyboard,    

1020
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:15,403
I'm gonna have it               
autocapitalize every word.      

1021
00:44:15,472 --> 00:44:19,273
So that if you say sad it       
will be capital S-A-D.          

1022
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:21,909
It will just look nicer in      
my other table I think.         

1023
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,611
And then finally, what          
about the auto layout here?     

1024
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,845
Where do we want                
this to appear?                 

1025
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:29,215
Well I think we just want       
this thing to be centered in    

1026
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,651
there so I am going to pick     
centered horizontally and       

1027
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,388
centered vertically I just      
control dragged to this row.    

1028
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:37,923
And so, that's good enough.     

1029
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:39,791
You notice that it's yellow,    
right?                          

1030
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,491
Why is it yellow?               

1031
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,527
Because my constraints don't    
match what's on screen.         

1032
00:44:43,596 --> 00:44:45,996
So, I can fix that in           
my document outline.            

1033
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:47,563
Indeed, here's that yellow.     

1034
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:50,833
I go up here, I click on this,  
I'll use update frames here to  

1035
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,536
misplace it and moves           
name into the right spot.       

1036
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:57,239
Okay, we already have our auto  
layout and everything for       

1037
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:57,872
the face view.                  

1038
00:44:57,941 --> 00:44:59,507
How about this guy down here?   

1039
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:02,409
Let's us zoom in again and      
look.                           

1040
00:45:02,478 --> 00:45:06,513
What I'm actually going to put  
another constraint on here to   

1041
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:10,050
show you a little more          
sophisticated constraints,      

1042
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:13,087
which is do I ever want         
to allow this to spill of       

1043
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:16,890
the edges?                      

1044
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:20,260
ta-table view so narrow that    
it wouldn't even fit these?     

1045
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:22,394
And the answer is no way.       

1046
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:25,631
I would never want the table    
view to be that narrow.         

1047
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,699
I always want it to be wide     
enough to at least fit          

1048
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:28,900
all these buttons.              

1049
00:45:28,968 --> 00:45:32,502
So I'm gonna CTRL + drag        
from this right edge            

1050
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:35,138
over to this to do              
the trailing space.             

1051
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,541
Okay.                           
So great to this eye beam       

1052
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,009
right here that you're          
very similar with.              

1053
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:41,944
We can click on it.             

1054
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:42,978
Where is it?                    
There it is.                    

1055
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:46,448
But I don't actually            
want it to be 75.               

1056
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:49,817
I want it to be zero,           
all the way over the edge.      

1057
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:53,021
But I don't actually don't      
want it to be equal to zero.    

1058
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,256
Because then that means that    
edge is always gonna be pinned  

1059
00:45:55,325 --> 00:46:00,094
over there and that's gonna     
stretch my control out and      

1060
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:03,097
I do want the secondary         
control to be, you know,        

1061
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:06,166
fit into its text, but I don't  
wanna be stuck over here.       

1062
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:09,168
So what I'm gonna do is make    
it to be greater than or        

1063
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:10,637
equal to zero.                  

1064
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,772
So we have not seen this        
kind of constraint,             

1065
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:14,973
where you're not setting        
it equal to something,          

1066
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,008
you're setting it               
greater than equal.             

1067
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,576
what I'm saying is, the         
distance between this edge and  

1068
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:20,076
And that's what,                

1069
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:22,914
right here must be              
at least zero, so               

1070
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:25,115
it can't be negative, it can't  
have pushed off the edge.       

1071
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:26,015
You see that?                   

1072
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:29,018
That's gonna keep my table      
view big enough, to do this.    

1073
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,186
And now, of course,             

1074
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,989
I need to do the same thing     
on the other side of this.      

1075
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,457
I'll Ctrl+drag over here,       
leading space.                  

1076
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:39,795
And we'll click on this one     
and we'll say 0 as well, and    

1077
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:41,462
we want this to be              
greater than or equal.          

1078
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:45,132
So I'm just guaranteeing        
that that thing is gonna be,    

1079
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,501
greater than or equal to.       

1080
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,840
Okay, now it's let's double     
check all of our things here.   

1081
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:55,375
So we've got the trailing       
space and leading space.        

1082
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:58,144
So this one also I probably     
want in the middle, so          

1083
00:46:58,213 --> 00:46:59,712
I'm gonna Ctrl+drag.            

1084
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:02,215
Okay, and say I want            
horizontally and vertically.    

1085
00:47:03,785 --> 00:47:05,917
Okay, so it's not where         
it's supposed to be so          

1086
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:08,753
I can update its frame right    
here and it looks good.         

1087
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:10,054
It's where it's                 
supposed to be.                 

1088
00:47:10,123 --> 00:47:12,055
I'm guaranteed that it's        
never going to spill out over   

1089
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,391
the edges because I put         
that side constraint in.        

1090
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,927
Let's do the exam same thing    
with this one right here.       

1091
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:17,894
CTRL + drag.                    

1092
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:20,896
Center it vertically.           

1093
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:21,697
CTRL + drag.                    

1094
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:23,732
Center it horizontally.         

1095
00:47:23,801 --> 00:47:25,801
CTRL + drag to the edge.        

1096
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:31,505
This the trailing space.        

1097
00:47:31,574 --> 00:47:32,372
We're going here.               

1098
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,907
We want it to be                
greater than or                 

1099
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:38,712
equal to zero, and              
the same thing over here.       

1100
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,314
This the leading                
edge will come out,             

1101
00:47:42,383 --> 00:47:44,784
we want that to be greater      
than or equal to zero.          

1102
00:47:47,887 --> 00:47:48,886
Okay, get that right,           

1103
00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:50,655
did I say greater               
than equal to there?            

1104
00:47:50,723 --> 00:47:51,489
Yes I did.                      

1105
00:47:51,557 --> 00:47:53,991
Okay, this one also,            
not positioned properly,        

1106
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,492
no problem, we go over here.    

1107
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,727
Update frames, looking good.    

1108
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:01,030
Okay, a lot of layout issues.   

1109
00:48:01,098 --> 00:48:06,769
All right, here's our UI here,  
looking pretty good.            

1110
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:08,503
Let's go ahead and              
run this and                    

1111
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:10,906
just see what our UI            
looks like, see if we.          

1112
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:13,175
Got everything where we         
wanted, things are centered,    

1113
00:48:13,243 --> 00:48:15,843
things are the right size,      
all that business.              

1114
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:17,177
Okay so we'll go over here,     

1115
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:18,945
bring it up,                    
looking pretty good.            

1116
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:22,216
The only thing is, that face,   

1117
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:23,850
I'd like that face to           
be as big as possible.          

1118
00:48:23,919 --> 00:48:24,783
Look how the eyes are so        

1119
00:48:24,852 --> 00:48:27,152
little they're almost           
like solid eyes.                

1120
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:29,888
Really I'd like that            
row in the table                

1121
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:32,357
to be a square since            
my face is a circle.            

1122
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:33,457
I'd like it to be a square.     

1123
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:36,093
So how can I make               
that a square?                  

1124
00:48:36,162 --> 00:48:38,962
Hopefully all of you know this  
from your homework assignment.  

1125
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:40,898
How to control                  
the height of something.        

1126
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:45,168
I'm just gonna go into          
my code right here for          

1127
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,270
my expression editor.           

1128
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,205
that row I'm gonna have the     
table view's height for row.    

1129
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,073
And for                         

1130
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,842
Okay?                           
I'm gonna say if the index      

1131
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,411
path we're talking about,       

1132
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:59,513
row equals 1 cuz that's         
the second one down,            

1133
00:48:59,582 --> 00:49:01,548
that's where my face is,        
I'm kind of hard wiring this,   

1134
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:02,649
we could probably               
use constants,                  

1135
00:49:02,718 --> 00:49:03,984
all that stuff in here.         

1136
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:10,389
Then, I'm gonna return the      
table views bounds.size.width.  

1137
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,225
So I'm going make the height    
equal to the width.             

1138
00:49:12,294 --> 00:49:14,027
That way it'll be a square,     

1139
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:16,862
otherwise I'm gonna             
return our superclasses,        

1140
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,897
cuz we're overriding            
this function, right?           

1141
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:22,167
So TableView,                   
heightForRowAt, and             

1142
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:26,437
the TableView is our TableView  
and the height is at            

1143
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:31,042
this index path that it's       
asking us for right here.       

1144
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:33,177
Okay?                           

1145
00:49:35,414 --> 00:49:36,345
So, everybody got that?         

1146
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:40,849
So let's run, and see if        
it makes that thing square.     

1147
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:42,118
Should make that face square.   

1148
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:48,757
All right, let's go back here.  

1149
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,508
sure enough we've got a nice    
big square face here.           

1150
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:52,192
Click, and                      

1151
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:53,093
Okay, so this is excellent.     

1152
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:54,895
We got our UI exactly           
the way we want it.             

1153
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:56,596
Now we just need to             
hook up our outlets and         

1154
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,031
actions to this thing.          

1155
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:01,700
We're gonna need outlets to     
these two segmented controls    

1156
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:02,751
And an outlet to this name,     
so we can get the name.         

1157
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:03,734
right here.                     

1158
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:07,405
And build an expression out of  
the settings of this switch.    

1159
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:08,205
And then obviously,             

1160
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:11,074
we're gonna need to be able to  
set our face view to reflect    

1161
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:11,775
that as well.                   

1162
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:13,276
So let's go do that.            

1163
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:17,180
Go back to our                  
storyboard here.                

1164
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:21,418
That, this up,                  
let's close that, all right.    

1165
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,120
Zoom in a little bit here.      

1166
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,792
Okay, so let's create outlets   
for these two things and for    

1167
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,792
this name.                      

1168
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:34,395
So Ctrl-drag over here.         

1169
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:40,400
Call that our nameTextField,    
we'll control drag from         

1170
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:45,105
this guy down here, we'll call  
this our eyeControl, and we'll  

1171
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:53,847
drag from this one,             
call that our mouthControl.     

1172
00:50:55,483 --> 00:50:59,518
Okay, so we got our nice,       
outlets there.                  

1173
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:02,354
Let's go ahead and think about  
the model of this control,      

1174
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:02,921
what does it do?                

1175
00:51:02,989 --> 00:51:03,721
It's an editor.                 

1176
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,057
It edits an expression,         
a named expression actually.    

1177
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:10,727
So it clearly has something     
which is the name, okay?        

1178
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:11,795
So we'll make the name,         

1179
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:15,198
we'll have that be              
our nameTextField.              

1180
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:18,201
Text, and if we don't           
have a nameTextField yet,       

1181
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:21,971
like we're preloaded, we'll     
just return a empty string.     

1182
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:24,940
Okay, so that's the name part.  

1183
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:27,075
And of course,                  
we have an expression as well,  

1184
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:30,011
that's gonna be                 
FacialExpression.               

1185
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,413
And we'll return by creating    
a FacialExpression, and         

1186
00:51:33,482 --> 00:51:37,150
here is its constructor, we'll  
make it a little easier to see  

1187
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,553
when we're an arrow             
here like this.                 

1188
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,724
Okay, so                        
how are we gonna set the eyes?  

1189
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:46,859
We're gonna look at             
our eye control and             

1190
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:47,893
see what the eyes are.          

1191
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:48,559
How do we set the mouth?        

1192
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:50,462
We're gonna look at             
our mouth control.              

1193
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,162
So to make this easy,           

1194
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:53,798
I'm gonna make a little         
private var here.               

1195
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:55,432
Actually a let.                 

1196
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:58,835
I'm gonna call this my          
eyeChoices, okay, these         

1197
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:01,571
are the three choices in my     
set menu control view there,    

1198
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,842
it's just going to be a little  
array that has facial, oops,    

1199
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:11,980
Z, equals an array with         
FacialExpression.Eyes,          

1200
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:15,317
and we've got open, closed,     
and squinting, those            

1201
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:19,254
are the Three different things  
in our segmented control.       

1202
00:52:19,323 --> 00:52:22,623
So now to make this I's         
thing I can just return here    

1203
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:24,325
my i choices.                   

1204
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:27,595
And the index I'm gonna         
use is my eye control.          

1205
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:31,331
And the way you get which of    
the segments is controlled is   

1206
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,933
picked in a segmented           
control is with the method in   

1207
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:38,838
segmented control called        
selected segment index.         

1208
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:42,909
Selected segment index.         

1209
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:45,344
And of course our eye           
control might not be set yet,   

1210
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,913
in which case we'll default     
to just doing segment 0.        

1211
00:52:47,982 --> 00:52:52,417
Okay?                           
Does everybody see what we're,  

1212
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:53,151
what we're doing there?         

1213
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,619
To do that?                     

1214
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:57,054
And same thing with the mouth.  

1215
00:52:57,123 --> 00:53:01,158
We'll have some                 
mouth choices here.             

1216
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:06,029
These are                       
facialExpression.mouth.         

1217
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,430
What have we got here, frown.   

1218
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:10,967
We've got smirk,                
we've got neutral,              

1219
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:14,070
we've got grin and              
we've got smile.                

1220
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,456
Do the same thing here,         
we'll say mouthChoices.         

1221
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:18,773
Okay?                           

1222
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:25,012
So mouthControl this time,      
selectedSegment Index.          

1223
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:28,116
And again we'll default to 0.   

1224
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:31,752
So everyone see how we've       
created our facial expression   

1225
00:53:31,821 --> 00:53:32,718
from our UI?                    

1226
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:35,120
This is essentially our model,  
it's a read only model.         

1227
00:53:35,189 --> 00:53:38,057
You could imagine designing     
this to not be read only,       

1228
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,759
where you might want to have    
this editor start with some     

1229
00:53:40,828 --> 00:53:41,860
expression you set.             

1230
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:45,764
But we're just gonna do         
this to make it easy.           

1231
00:53:45,832 --> 00:53:46,964
Read only.                      

1232
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:48,899
And one other thing we want     
to do is whenever these         

1233
00:53:48,968 --> 00:53:50,501
are changed over here,          
well, for                       

1234
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:52,903
now every time someone clicks   
on one of these we're just      

1235
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:55,405
gonna print on the console      
what our expression is.         

1236
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:58,307
So let's create a little        
target action from this guy,    

1237
00:53:58,376 --> 00:53:59,642
control drag.                   

1238
00:53:59,711 --> 00:54:03,612
We'll call it                   
updateface cuz that's           

1239
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,181
what we're gonna need to do     
is update this face up here.    

1240
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:07,616
We don't need any               
arguments to it.                

1241
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,486
Okay so this update face is     
gonna have to change this face  

1242
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:15,422
to reflect the eyes and stuff,  
but for now I'm just gonna say  

1243
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:20,727
print our name equals           
our expression.                 

1244
00:54:20,796 --> 00:54:23,196
So like sad equals,             

1245
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:25,564
you know frown plus             
closed eyes or whatever.        

1246
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:29,902
Okay, and we'll have this       
one do the exact same thing.    

1247
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:34,807
To the same action,             
everybody cool?                 

1248
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:37,676
So we just actions to make      
our, our thing work here.       

1249
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:42,513
So let's go run, see if our     
UI is basically working.        

1250
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:45,183
It's, it needs to be hooked     
up to the rest of our app but   

1251
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:47,719
still we wanna make sure it's   
it's functioning property,      

1252
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:48,752
properly.                       

1253
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,937
Let's add, we'll call this,     
here's a interesting thing.     

1254
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:53,055
So, let's go here.              

1255
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,692
See when I click on these       
it selected this row.           

1256
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,426
I didn't want this row          

1257
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,394
to be selected like in          
a table view sense.             

1258
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:03,398
I just wanted it to edit        
this name right here so         

1259
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,399
that's not good, so             
we'll have to fix that.         

1260
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,635
But let's go ahead and          
put in a test name.             

1261
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,470
We'll say test, return.         

1262
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:12,773
Return doesn't get              
rid of the keyboard.            

1263
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:13,840
So that's bad, bad UI.          

1264
00:55:13,908 --> 00:55:15,007
Because now it's                

1265
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,675
really hard to get to           
these things down here.         

1266
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:18,977
I can get to them,              
because this is a scroll view.  

1267
00:55:19,046 --> 00:55:20,545
Table view is a scroll view.    

1268
00:55:20,614 --> 00:55:22,080
But it's still kinda bad UI.    

1269
00:55:22,149 --> 00:55:24,181
So we gotta fix that as well.   

1270
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,250
So let's pick eyes closed and   

1271
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,985
see if our console is           
saying anything and             

1272
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:32,222
sure it's saying test equals    
eyes closed mouth frown.        

1273
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,691
That looks right eyes           
closed mouth frown.             

1274
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,627
Let's say squinting grin.       

1275
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:40,796
Squinting grin.                 

1276
00:55:40,864 --> 00:55:43,098
Okay so it looks like           
our UI is working but           

1277
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,266
it's got these two problems.    

1278
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:46,700
So let's fix the problem where  
it's selecting this row in      

1279
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:48,736
the table view sense when       
we click in there and           

1280
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:51,838
let's fix the problem           
where a return key is not       

1281
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,139
resigning first responder and.  

1282
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,307
And making                      
the keyboard go away.           

1283
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:57,243
So both of those                
are easy to do.                 

1284
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:59,678
We can do that most of          
this in a story board.          

1285
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:02,314
So let's go back to our story   
board full screen here.         

1286
00:56:02,382 --> 00:56:05,884
So the way to make it, so it    
doesn't select rows in here,    

1287
00:56:05,953 --> 00:56:09,287
is just- Select our             
table view and if you,          

1288
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:11,055
when you do your inspector      
on a table view, you'll see     

1289
00:56:11,123 --> 00:56:13,891
there's selection down here     
in the table view selector.     

1290
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:16,427
We want to change that to       
no selection that means         

1291
00:56:16,496 --> 00:56:18,528
rows are not selected           
in our table view.              

1292
00:56:18,597 --> 00:56:21,131
You almost always want this     
in a static table view.         

1293
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,300
Rarely are you selecting the    
rows in a table It it stack     

1294
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:28,270
table, sometimes you might be   
but rarely are you doing that.  

1295
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:31,807
And the other problem was       
our text field right here,      

1296
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:34,876
we wanted it to do              
resign first responder.         

1297
00:56:34,945 --> 00:56:37,645
So I'm gonna show you a little  
trick here which is how we can  

1298
00:56:37,714 --> 00:56:41,916
wire this text field up to our  
view controller as a delegate   

1299
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,383
without any code.               

1300
00:56:43,452 --> 00:56:47,154
Okay, so do the wiring up,      
I'm just gonna control drag     

1301
00:56:47,222 --> 00:56:49,656
from my text field up           
to my view controller.          

1302
00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:52,191
Remember this little yellow     
thing at the top represents     

1303
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:52,825
my view controller.             

1304
00:56:52,894 --> 00:56:54,726
So I'm gonna control            
drag right there and            

1305
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:57,963
when I do, look,                
I can hook up outlets.          

1306
00:56:58,032 --> 00:57:00,598
I'm gonna hook up this text     
field's delegate right there,   

1307
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,501
so now this view                
controller is the delegate      

1308
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:04,936
of this text field.             

1309
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:10,041
Now we still have to go back    
here and make it be a UI        

1310
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:14,111
text field delegate and         
of course                       

1311
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:18,315
we still want to implement      
our text field should return.   

1312
00:57:18,384 --> 00:57:24,454
Not should clear,               
text field should return And    

1313
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:27,557
we're just gonna have the text  
field resignFirstResponder.     

1314
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:32,561
Responds to [LAUGH]             
resignFirstResponder and        

1315
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,596
return true.                    

1316
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:35,714
I just want to just use that    
as a trick to show you you can  

1317
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:36,764
Okay, so                        

1318
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:41,435
control drag to set outwards    
of things as well if you want.  

1319
00:57:41,504 --> 00:57:43,604
So we fixed our two             
problems right there.           

1320
00:57:46,575 --> 00:57:49,276
So our UI should be             
looking good now.               

1321
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:54,180
There it is, go here.           

1322
00:57:54,248 --> 00:57:57,950
Okay, let's try the text        
again, let's say Test, and      

1323
00:57:58,019 --> 00:57:59,084
Return.                         

1324
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:00,586
Design's first responder and    

1325
00:58:00,654 --> 00:58:02,821
notice when I clicked on test   
it didn't click this row,       

1326
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,722
when I click down here,         
it's not clicking this row.     

1327
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,523
Even if I click on              
the edges of it                 

1328
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:09,559
Is still not selecting it.      

1329
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:12,061
Okay, what about the face?      

1330
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,764
We gotta get that face, so      

1331
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:16,232
it's updating,                  
based on what's going on here.  

1332
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,768
Now, we've offered the option   
of squinting right here, so     

1333
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:23,305
really, what class              
needs to be in here?            

1334
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,408
What's the only class           
that does squinting?            

1335
00:58:26,477 --> 00:58:29,044
It's that blinking face         
view controller, right?         

1336
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:31,479
So we need to put               
an NBC in here, okay?           

1337
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:32,980
Blinking face view              
controller is an NBC,           

1338
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:35,716
we can't use face view, which   
is what I have in here now.     

1339
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:38,118
Face view doesn't know          
how to do squinting, so         

1340
00:58:38,186 --> 00:58:39,419
we need to put an NBC.          

1341
00:58:39,488 --> 00:58:41,754
So this is where we're          
going to do an embedded         

1342
00:58:41,823 --> 00:58:43,890
view controller, so let's do    
the embedded view controller.   

1343
00:58:45,892 --> 00:58:47,359
Okay, we're gonna go here,      
we hit,                         

1344
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:49,561
right now we have it's          
face view inside here.          

1345
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,562
So we're just gonna get         
rid of that face view,          

1346
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:52,162
we don't want that.             

1347
00:58:52,231 --> 00:58:54,331
Oops, I dela deleted            
the entire row, sorry.          

1348
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:58,801
Is that my face                 
view right there?               

1349
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,070
Yeah, so                        
we'll delete the face view and  

1350
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:04,473
instead of having a face view,  
I'm gonna go over here and      

1351
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:07,542
look for a container view.      

1352
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,377
Container, there it is,         

1353
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:13,115
container view, I'm gonna drag  
this container view in here.    

1354
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:15,416
I'm gonna do the exact same     
thing as I did before.          

1355
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,752
I'm gonna use my bl let's,      
zoom in a little so             

1356
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:19,954
I can see it a little better.   

1357
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:23,890
I'm gonna use my da dash blue   
lines to place this thing       

1358
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:24,991
where I want.                   

1359
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:28,627
I'm still going to do reset to  
constraint, I'm going to check  

1360
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:31,263
that make sure that this        
is all hooked up right.         

1361
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:33,299
It appears to be                
hooked up right,                

1362
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:36,735
look what also appeared,        
it's kind of hidden,            

1363
00:59:36,803 --> 00:59:42,040
it's kind of afraid,            
there it is, right here.        

1364
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:46,377
Okay, when we created this      
in it also created this         

1365
00:59:46,446 --> 00:59:47,679
new NBC right here.             

1366
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:54,084
Okay, this is the MVC whose     
self.view is going to appear    

1367
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:56,953
right here, and all the auto    
layout constraints are gonna    

1368
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:58,020
apply to it and everything so   

1369
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:00,556
it's gonna be fit in there and  
everything.                     

1370
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,690
So what do we want this to be?  

1371
01:00:01,758 --> 01:00:03,558
Wel, we want it                 
to be a blinking,               

1372
01:00:03,626 --> 01:00:04,326
face view controller.           

1373
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:07,195
So I'm gonna go here,           
go to identity, Fir-,           

1374
01:00:07,263 --> 01:00:08,028
I'm gonna select this.          

1375
01:00:08,097 --> 01:00:10,731
Go to identity and say          
blinking face view controller.  

1376
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,501
Of course, I have to still      
build the UI of this thing and  

1377
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,802
of course it has                
a face view in it.              

1378
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:18,237
So I'm gonna again try and      
copy and paste,                 

1379
01:00:18,306 --> 01:00:20,740
it didn't work last time I      
did it but we'll try again.     

1380
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,241
Paste, there we go.             

1381
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,111
Okay and so we're gonna         
make it fit perfectly           

1382
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:31,115
in here as usual,               
ahead and reset.                

1383
01:00:31,183 --> 01:00:34,651
Adjust constraints and of       
course, this phase view right   

1384
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,288
here needs to be wired up as    
an outlet of this blinking      

1385
01:00:38,357 --> 01:00:41,225
face view controller and        
how am I gonna do that?         

1386
01:00:41,293 --> 01:00:43,326
Same way I did that text        
field delegate, so,             

1387
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:45,961
we'll control drag now from     
the view controller to this     

1388
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,163
face view and wire it up.       

1389
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,064
We don't have to                
bring up the code,              

1390
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:51,566
in a side by side window,       
especially this is a pain for   

1391
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:52,901
blinking view controller.       

1392
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:57,005
Because, the, it's a subclass   
of it, a superclass,            

1393
01:00:57,073 --> 01:01:00,240
rather that we're hooking       
up to, etc, okay?               

1394
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:05,079
So I built this embedded view,  
I've created the MVC is         

1395
01:01:05,148 --> 01:01:08,915
actually the way I want and     
so now if we run.               

1396
01:01:08,984 --> 01:01:12,285
We should have that blinking    
view controller embedded        

1397
01:01:12,354 --> 01:01:14,186
inside of this                  
into that row and               

1398
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,088
of course it should be square.  

1399
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:19,758
And all those things just       
as if it were the regular       

1400
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:22,461
face view I'm sure              
that here it is.                

1401
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,296
Okay now, how do make it so     

1402
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,131
when we change these things,    
it changes this?                

1403
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,100
Well, this is just              
a segue right here, so          

1404
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:31,368
in our prepare for segue,       

1405
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,104
we're gonna grab onto that      
blinking view controller.       

1406
01:01:34,172 --> 01:01:36,205
And then every time things      
change, we'll just tell         

1407
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:38,474
the blinking view controller    
what its expression is, so      

1408
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:39,708
let's give this thing a name.   

1409
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:45,080
We'll call this our EmbedFace,  
segue right here, and let's     

1410
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:50,452
go back to our editor and it's  
the thing we're segueing from.  

1411
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:54,990
So it's the thing that gets to  
prepare, so let's go prepare    

1412
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:58,593
for segue, and                  
inside this prepare for segue.  

1413
01:01:58,662 --> 01:02:02,063
All we really need to do        
is grab onto that Face view     

1414
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:05,866
controller, so let's create     
a little private var,           

1415
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:09,802
which we'll call our            
faceViewController.             

1416
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:14,074
It's going to be of type        
linkingFaceViewController and   

1417
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:16,342
it's not set initially, so      
we'll have it be an optional.   

1418
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:21,080
And here I'm just gonna say     
if the segue.destination        

1419
01:02:21,148 --> 01:02:24,482
view controller is, actually    
we'll even say if let.          

1420
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:28,053
Let's say if let Controller     
we didn't mean to do that,      

1421
01:02:28,122 --> 01:02:30,555
actually I can do an even       
easier way to do it.            

1422
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:34,258
Let's just say face view        
controller equals the segue's   

1423
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:37,261
destination as a blinking       
view controller and             

1424
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,964
if it's not a blinking view     
controller and won't work.      

1425
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:44,000
Then of course we probably      
want to check our identifier    

1426
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:46,769
here so we'll say if            
the segue's identifier =,       

1427
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:48,137
what did I call it?             

1428
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:48,905
Embed Face.                     

1429
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:52,941
Then we'll do this.             

1430
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:56,176
Okay?                           
So all I did here,              

1431
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:58,679
when I'm preparing,             
is just grab onto               

1432
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:02,583
that view controller, so now    
I have the view controller.     

1433
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:05,519
So for example,                 
when updateFace happens, okay?  

1434
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:07,086
Instead of printing             
out on the console,             

1435
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:09,955
I can just say that             
my faceViewController           

1436
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:15,027
expression equals my            
expression, right?              

1437
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:19,798
My expression is this thing     
right here, cool with that?     

1438
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:20,566
Let's go see that.              

1439
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:27,037
Okay, so we go here,            
we add eyes closed,             

1440
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:30,541
looking good and                
the frown there, grin.          

1441
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,744
Notice that it started out      
with the wrong face though,     

1442
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:34,611
so probably,                    

1443
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,980
when I grab that face view      
controller right here,          

1444
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:43,085
probably want to update it      
right away with my expression.  

1445
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:44,153
Whatever expression             
I have now.                     

1446
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:47,489
In other words, as soon as      
that embedded segue gets        

1447
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:50,859
embedded, I wanna have it       
update with my my face, but     

1448
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:54,262
it's working, and it even       
works for squinting, okay?      

1449
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,997
So we got squinting             
even happening in here.         

1450
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,634
All right, we got this          
awesome system here,            

1451
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:04,772
this awesome MVC for            
editing and                     

1452
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,042
emotion right with the          
emotion's name and its face.    

1453
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:13,146
So how do we communicate        
what we just edited back?       

1454
01:04:13,214 --> 01:04:15,615
And that's through unwinding    
ao let's go ahead and           

1455
01:04:15,683 --> 01:04:20,653
create an unwind segue back     
to our presenter okay.          

1456
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:24,990
And let's move this thing so    
we can see this whole thing,    

1457
01:04:25,058 --> 01:04:26,925
what we're doing here.          

1458
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:29,960
So we're going to create an     
unwind from a done button in    

1459
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:32,763
this, and it's going to         
unwind back to this guy.        

1460
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:35,999
And when it unwinds we'll       
communicate the expression and  

1461
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:38,968
the name of the expression      
that was chosen here in this    

1462
01:04:39,037 --> 01:04:40,337
editor.                         

1463
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:44,207
Now what's the first thing      
we want to do in unwind?        

1464
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:47,043
We need to create that magic    
method to unwind to, that's     

1465
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:48,810
always the first thing you're   
gonna do when you unwind.       

1466
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:51,746
So that's over here in this     
EmotionsViewController, so      

1467
01:04:51,815 --> 01:04:54,482
let's go over to the            
EmotionsViewController, and     

1468
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,818
create that magic method,       
put it right here at the top.   

1469
01:04:57,887 --> 01:05:00,521
Okay, it's gotta                
be an IBAction.                 

1470
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:03,724
Okay, just a function, we can   
call it anything we want.       

1471
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:05,225
I'll call this,                 

1472
01:05:05,294 --> 01:05:08,661
addEmotionalFace, because       
that's what it's gonna do,      

1473
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,365
it's gonna add an emotional     
face to this array right here.  

1474
01:05:12,434 --> 01:05:14,767
And I'll say from segue         

1475
01:05:14,836 --> 01:05:18,571
UIStoryBoardSegue, and this     
satisfies the second thing we   

1476
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,607
have to do which it has         
one and only one argument.      

1477
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:26,344
And hit the storyboard segue    
and inside here, we will use    

1478
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:29,914
the segue information to get    
the expression that we chose.   

1479
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:33,417
So, now let's go back           
to our storyboard.              

1480
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:40,623
And wire up that,               
unwind which we do right here.  

1481
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:43,025
So I'm gonna add a done         
button right here.              

1482
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:47,764
Click down here, this is        
bar button, there it is.        

1483
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:50,565
Okay, I wanted                  
a standard one again,           

1484
01:05:50,634 --> 01:05:51,666
this is the done button.        

1485
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:53,767
See all these standard          
ones we had add for             

1486
01:05:53,836 --> 01:05:57,371
the other one, cancel for the   
other one, done for this one.   

1487
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,806
So we have done and             

1488
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,675
I'm just gonna control drag,    
over there?                     

1489
01:06:01,744 --> 01:06:02,742
No, up here.                    

1490
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:06,646
Okay, so this exit button.      

1491
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:08,380
look what appeared there,       
add emotional face from.        

1492
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,047
When I let go,                  

1493
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:11,617
Notice that it puts             
the little from                 

1494
01:06:11,685 --> 01:06:13,451
that was the external           
name on the end of it.          

1495
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,821
It's kind of a backwards        
compatibility with objective c  

1496
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,189
there and so, I click that      
I want that connection and      

1497
01:06:19,258 --> 01:06:20,457
now it's made that segue.       

1498
01:06:20,526 --> 01:06:21,858
Now where is that segue?        

1499
01:06:21,927 --> 01:06:23,460
If I zoom out am I              
gonna be able to see            

1500
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:24,794
that on my storyboard?          

1501
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:26,229
No, you don't see it, so        

1502
01:06:26,297 --> 01:06:29,431
where are things that you       
can't see in your storyboard?   

1503
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,432
Where do you go to find them?   

1504
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:33,301
Yeah, the document              
outline here,                   

1505
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:36,003
so let's go to the document     
outline and sure enough,        

1506
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:37,354
Look at that, unwind segue      
to add emotional faces,         

1507
01:06:37,355 --> 01:06:38,638
right here.                     

1508
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:39,972
we could give this segue.       

1509
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,942
A name, maybe we could call it  

1510
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:44,810
add emotion because that's      
what it does, right?            

1511
01:06:44,879 --> 01:06:47,412
It calls this add               
emotional face so               

1512
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:49,648
it kind of add emotion segue.   

1513
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:52,550
Now we could transfer           
our information kind of         

1514
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:55,620
either way, either in           
the prepare in this guy.        

1515
01:06:55,688 --> 01:06:58,522
But I usually like to do it     
in this guy because this is     

1516
01:06:58,591 --> 01:07:01,558
the guy who I would have to     
create some public API to add   

1517
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:03,460
an emotional face or            
something.                      

1518
01:07:03,528 --> 01:07:06,496
So I'm just gonna have this     
guy and his special method.     

1519
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:10,767
He's going to ask the editor    
there what is your expression   

1520
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:15,271
and name and it's gonna         
add it to his model here.       

1521
01:07:16,507 --> 01:07:21,043
All right, so                   
we're gonna say if we can let   

1522
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:24,011
the editor, basically           
we'll call it editor.           

1523
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,947
If we can let the editor        
equal the segue is what?        

1524
01:07:27,016 --> 01:07:30,084
The source,                     
it's the source of the segue,   

1525
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:33,721
we're segueing from             
the editor to this guy.         

1526
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:38,925
So this as                      
a ExpressionEditorViewCOntrol-  

1527
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:40,727
ler, so                         
if I'm able to get the editor,  

1528
01:07:40,796 --> 01:07:42,762
then I'm just gonna             
say EmotionalFaces.             

1529
01:07:42,831 --> 01:07:46,032
Not kGuard [LAUGH]              
EmotionalFaces, append, and     

1530
01:07:46,101 --> 01:07:48,667
I wanna append a tuple,         
and the tuple is                

1531
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:53,138
gonna have the editor's name,   
and the editor's expression.    

1532
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,475
That's it!                      

1533
01:07:57,543 --> 01:07:58,909
To unwind?                      

1534
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:01,945
Super simple, all right.        

1535
01:08:02,014 --> 01:08:03,546
So, here's, we got worried.     

1536
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:05,849
We got happy, we got sad.       

1537
01:08:05,918 --> 01:08:10,386
Let's add another one,          
let's go, I don't know.         

1538
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:14,156
Now let's go, okay, this face   
looks like contentment to me,   

1539
01:08:14,225 --> 01:08:15,657
he looks content so             

1540
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,225
we're going to call             
this one content.               

1541
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:23,431
Content, content,               
there it is, okay?              

1542
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,500
So we've got this named         
content, eyes closed, grin,     

1543
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,370
I'm going to hit done right     
here, it's going to unwind and  

1544
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,438
add that, hopefully,            
and it didn't show.             

1545
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,574
Anyone have an idea why         
it didn't show there?           

1546
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,310
Because we appended             
it to our model, but            

1547
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:39,812
we never told                   
the tableview to update.        

1548
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,014
Okay, so this is a common       
thing you'll do, you'll update  

1549
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,617
your model and you're like,     
my tableview doesn't work.      

1550
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,652
And we just need to             
do tableview here,              

1551
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,588
reload data cuz it to call of   

1552
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:53,290
its UI table view data          
source methods again.           

1553
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,959
Hopefully you experience that,  

1554
01:08:55,027 --> 01:08:56,559
maybe in your                   
homework assignment.            

1555
01:08:56,628 --> 01:09:01,131
You're used to this             
particular forgetfulness but    

1556
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,000
here we go, try again.          

1557
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:08,471
Okay, we'll do content again,   
I liked content, content,       

1558
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:14,743
Tent there it is and content    
was what did I say, green.      

1559
01:09:14,812 --> 01:09:17,712
Eyes closed yes looks content,  
done, there's content.          

1560
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,113
We click on it,                 
we've got content,              

1561
01:09:19,181 --> 01:09:20,247
we've got worried,              
we've got happy.                

1562
01:09:20,316 --> 01:09:25,886
Whoops, happy, okay?            

1563
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:28,088
Everybody understand            
that unwinding?                 

1564
01:09:28,157 --> 01:09:30,290
Everyone understand the modal?  

1565
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,124
Lets go take a look             
at this on iPad,                

1566
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:33,025
lets see what it                
looks like here.                

1567
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:41,700
Okay, let's make                
this a lot smaller,             

1568
01:09:41,769 --> 01:09:45,437
is that the smallest            
we can make it?                 

1569
01:09:45,505 --> 01:09:47,104
No, four, here we go.           

1570
01:09:47,173 --> 01:09:49,541
Okay, so                        
here it is on iPad well,        

1571
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:52,476
lets go to landscape here,      
make sure it's working.         

1572
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:56,647
Sad, happy, worried,            
lets add another one, woah!     

1573
01:09:56,715 --> 01:10:01,485
Big face, now, this is the      
kind of UI that in your final   

1574
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:04,187
project you're going to         
get dinged on the UI            

1575
01:10:04,255 --> 01:10:07,490
part of the rubric,             
because this is a horrible UI.  

1576
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:10,325
Look at the tiny,               
little things at the bottom,    

1577
01:10:10,394 --> 01:10:13,395
gigantic face this              
is a classic,                   

1578
01:10:13,464 --> 01:10:16,431
my app works on iPad and        
iPhone, okay?                   

1579
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,432
Because I just                  

1580
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,801
clicked the button that         
said do iPad, okay?             

1581
01:10:19,869 --> 01:10:22,303
Sometimes we have to do more    
to make things work on both     

1582
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:25,472
platforms and in this case,     
clearly this is bad UI.         

1583
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,090
it's an opportunity to make     
points on your rubric and your  

1584
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:28,640
And in fact,                    

1585
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,711
final project by implementing   
an iPad specific idiom.         

1586
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:34,747
In this case that's what we     
wanna do this clearly wants to  

1587
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:36,515
be in a pop over.               

1588
01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:39,818
When we click this little       
plus we want this a little      

1589
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:42,987
to appear right here in         
that little pop over, so        

1590
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:44,755
what do we need to do that?     

1591
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:49,060
Is could be simpler, we gonna   
go back to our story bore here  

1592
01:10:49,128 --> 01:10:51,728
and we're gonna                 
change this segue,              

1593
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:53,897
which is currently our          
modal segue, right?             

1594
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:56,833
The modal segway from           
emotions right here             

1595
01:10:56,901 --> 01:11:01,771
over to this editor from being  
modal to being a popover.       

1596
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:05,941
Now we know that it             
automatically is going to       

1597
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:10,512
adapt to being like modal       
full screen on the iPhone.      

1598
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,814
So by changing it to popover    
it's gonna work now on          

1599
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:13,882
both platforms but              

1600
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,951
we're going to see a little     
bit of problems here.           

1601
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:21,956
All right, so, let's try it,    
plus, nice, okay.               

1602
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,424
Maybe not seeing this very      
well because of the high        

1603
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,293
resolution being                
scaled way down but             

1604
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:29,262
it's picked a reasonable size,  
it's a little bigger than       

1605
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,364
it needs to be,                 
it's a reasonable size.         

1606
01:11:31,432 --> 01:11:34,466
But there's actually one thing  
that's wrong with this UI       

1607
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:36,635
which is this cancel            
button right here.              

1608
01:11:36,704 --> 01:11:39,938
Okay on in a pop over you       
don't have cancel buttons       

1609
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:43,374
because watch if I click        
over here it canceled it, so    

1610
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:46,677
I don't need this cancel        
button right here.              

1611
01:11:46,746 --> 01:11:49,480
I need it on iPhone but         
I don't need it on iPad, so     

1612
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:52,249
let's add a little bit of       
code to take this cancel        

1613
01:11:52,318 --> 01:11:53,015
button out.                     

1614
01:11:53,084 --> 01:11:54,483
If we're actually               
in a pop over,                  

1615
01:11:54,552 --> 01:11:57,019
and the way I'm going to tell   
I'm in a pop over is I'm going  

1616
01:11:57,088 --> 01:11:59,155
to look at my pop over          
presentation controller.        

1617
01:11:59,223 --> 01:12:01,823
And see if my arrow is          
pointing any way, and if my     

1618
01:12:01,892 --> 01:12:04,759
arrow is pointing somewhere     
I must be in a pop over.        

1619
01:12:04,828 --> 01:12:07,595
If i don't have an arrow then   
I'm probably over full screen.  

1620
01:12:08,597 --> 01:12:09,663
Okay so let's go ahead and      
do that.                        

1621
01:12:09,732 --> 01:12:14,868
Let's go back here              
to our editor and               

1622
01:12:14,937 --> 01:12:18,972
in our editor, I'm gonna do     
this in view will appear.       

1623
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:22,508
Nice late in the game time to   
do it, so view will appear,     

1624
01:12:22,577 --> 01:12:24,777
super view will appear.         

1625
01:12:26,447 --> 01:12:30,682
I'm just gonna say in here, if  
I can If I can, and here I'll   

1626
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:33,451
make it wide so that I have     
pick good variable names here.  

1627
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,422
If I can let                    
popoverPresentationController   

1628
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:45,962
= my navigationControllers      
popoverPresentationController.  

1629
01:12:46,031 --> 01:12:46,830
Now, why am I giving that       

1630
01:12:46,899 --> 01:12:49,266
navigationControllers           
popoverPresentationController?  

1631
01:12:49,335 --> 01:12:51,167
Cuz it's actually               
the highest level MVC           

1632
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:53,269
that's in the popover, okay?    

1633
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:54,670
Also, that cancel button        

1634
01:12:54,739 --> 01:12:56,405
is in the                       
navigationController, right?    

1635
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:57,872
It's part of                    
the navigation items for        

1636
01:12:57,941 --> 01:12:58,873
the navigationController,       

1637
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,207
so if I'm not in                
a navigationController,         

1638
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:02,276
this whole thing is             
kinda useless anyway.           

1639
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,678
So here I'm gonna say if the    
popoverPresentationControll-    

1640
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:09,650
er's arrowDirection equals      
unknown, or well let's say if   

1641
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,219
it doesn't equal unknown,       
so it points somewhere.         

1642
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:17,123
Then I must be in a popover,    
so I'm gonna remove             

1643
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:20,159
from my navigation items,       
my left bar button item.        

1644
01:13:22,562 --> 01:13:24,896
Okay, remember navigation item  
is what controls, what bar      

1645
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:27,733
buttons appear when you are in  
a navigation controller.        

1646
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:39,477
Okay, so here we go,            
we click, no cancel button      

1647
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,278
which is good and we'll run     
it on iPhone in a second and    

1648
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:44,281
we'll make sure the cancel      
button is still there.          

1649
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,649
Okay, what's another            
problem here though?            

1650
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,050
Well the problem is this        
is a little too big,            

1651
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:50,886
it's kind of got this extra     
space down here at the bottom   

1652
01:13:50,955 --> 01:13:52,555
that we don't want, okay?       

1653
01:13:52,623 --> 01:13:57,559
And, in fact, if I go this      
way, and I slide this out and   

1654
01:13:57,628 --> 01:14:00,428
bring this up, now it's         
a little too small, so          

1655
01:14:00,497 --> 01:14:02,764
it's either a little            
too small or too big.           

1656
01:14:02,832 --> 01:14:06,133
That's because it doesn't know  
how big this thing is, so       

1657
01:14:06,202 --> 01:14:08,435
it's just picking kind          
of standard sizes.              

1658
01:14:08,504 --> 01:14:10,670
For these particular            
orientations, so                

1659
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:14,941
let's teach this MBC, this      
editor MBC, how big it is.      

1660
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,044
And we're gonna do that by      
adding up all the heights       

1661
01:14:18,112 --> 01:14:21,747
of all the rows and seeing      
which row is the widest.        

1662
01:14:21,815 --> 01:14:25,284
By doing that, we'll be able    
to see how big this section     

1663
01:14:25,353 --> 01:14:27,886
in the table view is,           
we'll do that, and              

1664
01:14:27,954 --> 01:14:29,454
view will appear also.          

1665
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:34,893
I'm gonna say here,             
var size = tableView., well,    

1666
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:38,495
it'd really be nice if I had    
a method called minimumSize     

1667
01:14:38,564 --> 01:14:42,866
forSection: 0, okay, if it      
could just tell me the size.    

1668
01:14:42,935 --> 01:14:45,702
And unfortunately, tableView    
doesn't have a thing like that  

1669
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:50,173
but luckily for you I have      
such a thing right here         

1670
01:14:50,242 --> 01:14:54,143
as an extension today will      
view and we don't have time     

1671
01:14:54,212 --> 01:14:57,046
to type it all in such          
like quick typed it.            

1672
01:14:57,114 --> 01:14:59,315
But you can see as pretty easy  
it's just goes through all      

1673
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:02,984
the rows in the section that    
you ask and it gets the cell    

1674
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:06,287
at that row or even creates a   
cell at that row if necessary.  

1675
01:15:06,356 --> 01:15:09,089
And then it uses this really    
cool method here, system        

1676
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:13,928
layout, size fitting, UI        
layout, fitting compress size.  

1677
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:18,098
This guy right here             
uses auto layout                

1678
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:22,669
to say what's the smallest      
this thing can be, okay?        

1679
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:25,472
So this is a really             
cool little function            

1680
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,939
that you can do in UI view.     

1681
01:15:27,008 --> 01:15:29,475
By the way, notice I'm sending  
that to the content view of     

1682
01:15:29,543 --> 01:15:30,042
each cell.                      

1683
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:31,610
We didn't talk about            
content view but                

1684
01:15:31,678 --> 01:15:34,078
each table view cell has a      
content view that's where all   

1685
01:15:34,147 --> 01:15:35,379
the contents really are.        

1686
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,048
And that's the thing you want   
to ask to apply all the auto    

1687
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,318
layout rules to see             
if it will fit.                 

1688
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:43,853
So then here I'm just getting   
the one that's has that's       

1689
01:15:43,922 --> 01:15:46,222
the widest okay                 
maxing the width and            

1690
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,691
here I'm adding the heights     
of the rows okay?               

1691
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,292
Height for row is just          
the height of the row by        

1692
01:15:50,361 --> 01:15:52,328
asking the delegate here.       

1693
01:15:52,396 --> 01:15:55,463
Okay, so good, so we got        
the size this is the size,      

1694
01:15:55,532 --> 01:15:58,132
but actually we got a little    
trickiness to do here because   

1695
01:15:58,201 --> 01:15:59,868
we've got that                  
square face view.               

1696
01:15:59,936 --> 01:16:02,903
I still want it to be square    
even when I shrink it down.     

1697
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:08,408
So I'm going to take            
the size's height and remove    

1698
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:14,381
the height that it got for      
that                            

1699
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:20,020
index path that the little      
face is at, that's row 1.       

1700
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,722
Section 0, so                   
I'm gonna remove that and       

1701
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,757
I'm gonna add back              
the width of the tableView.     

1702
01:16:24,825 --> 01:16:29,527
Actually the width of           
the tableView I calculated,     

1703
01:16:29,596 --> 01:16:31,763
which is size, okay?            

1704
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:33,364
So I've just added              
it's square, so                 

1705
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:35,533
it's square in                  
the new smaller size.           

1706
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:39,136
Hopefully everybody understand  
what I did there, it looks      

1707
01:16:39,205 --> 01:16:42,172
like I'm missing something      
here yes the parenthesis.       

1708
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:46,543
Set it as our prefered content  
size equals that size.          

1709
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:49,846
So this prefered content        
size remember is the thing      

1710
01:16:49,915 --> 01:16:53,983
that tells the system           
this is how big this MVC        

1711
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:55,584
should be when it's             
in a pop over.                  

1712
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:58,320
So let's see if that worked,    
all right?                      

1713
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:01,789
So let's just slide it          
out here and click.             

1714
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:04,425
Perfect size right there,       
right?                          

1715
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:09,230
Let's do it in landscape,       
click, perfect size, okay?      

1716
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:14,235
So that's how you get your      
pop overs to fit their size     

1717
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:16,503
exactly, you've gotta figure    
out what their size is.         

1718
01:17:16,572 --> 01:17:17,704
Okay, that might be             
a little work but               

1719
01:17:17,772 --> 01:17:19,505
once you figure out what their  
size especially using that      

1720
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:23,509
nice system fitting thing,      
you can do that.                

1721
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:27,046
So last thing I wanna do        
is go back to iPhone and        

1722
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:31,650
see what damage we've           
over there by doing this        

1723
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:33,785
clicking this pop               
over business in.               

1724
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:38,289
Okay, so                        
here's our iPhone version, so   

1725
01:17:38,358 --> 01:17:42,526
still working here,             
plus it's still adapting.       

1726
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:44,896
It not, it didn't show it in a  
popover even though we changed  

1727
01:17:44,964 --> 01:17:47,665
this segue to be a popover      
on all platforms.               

1728
01:17:47,733 --> 01:17:50,834
It does that adaptive behavior  
to make this happen, okay,      

1729
01:17:50,903 --> 01:17:52,169
it's still working fine,        
though.                         

1730
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:55,304
Call this happy.                

1731
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:02,527
Works like a charm,             
let's take a look over here.    

1732
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,511
Okay?                           

1733
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:07,048
This is landscape mode on the   
phone, this is pretty good,     

1734
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,949
I'm sure, woah!                 

1735
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,584
Big forehead guy.               

1736
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,053
Okay, now again                 
you could argue                 

1737
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:16,656
well this is just the way it    
makes it be but this is bad.    

1738
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:19,225
This is bad UI, I mean          
really if you had an app and    

1739
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,227
you bought it and it did        
this you'd be like what the?    

1740
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:22,828
Who wrote that?                 

1741
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:25,330
Now this is a strange           
situation where on an iPhone I  

1742
01:18:25,398 --> 01:18:27,932
actually think this             
would look a ton better         

1743
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,167
as a pop over, wouldn't it?     

1744
01:18:30,236 --> 01:18:32,737
Because the pop over            
is nice minimum size,           

1745
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:35,973
so if we had this thing where   
you clicked on this plus.       

1746
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:38,508
And it made a nice little pop   
over here wow that'd be just    

1747
01:18:38,577 --> 01:18:40,477
really cool in landscape mode.  

1748
01:18:40,546 --> 01:18:43,345
So how can I make it stop       
adapting cuz that's, well       

1749
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:46,248
the problem here is when I hit  
plus it's adapting to the fact  

1750
01:18:46,317 --> 01:18:49,318
that it's on a compact width.   

1751
01:18:49,386 --> 01:18:51,887
All right, and it's turning     
it to full screen, so           

1752
01:18:51,955 --> 01:18:53,455
I don't want that, I want       
it to still be pop over.        

1753
01:18:53,524 --> 01:18:55,757
So let's use those that         
delegate method thing           

1754
01:18:55,826 --> 01:18:58,559
I was talking about to          
make it stop doing that.        

1755
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:02,696
So that delegate stuff          
happens in the prepare for      

1756
01:19:02,765 --> 01:19:05,365
this segway, that prepare       
happens over here in            

1757
01:19:05,434 --> 01:19:06,533
the emotions view controllers.  

1758
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:07,933
We already have a prepare for   
that,                           

1759
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:10,436
just preparing                  
a different segue,              

1760
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:12,504
it's the segue that             
actually shows the face.        

1761
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:14,406
So here I'm just                
gonna say else,                 

1762
01:19:14,475 --> 01:19:15,673
because I'm not talking         
about that segue,               

1763
01:19:15,742 --> 01:19:18,276
I'm gonna talking about         
a different one else if         

1764
01:19:18,345 --> 01:19:24,081
the segues destination          
is the editor,                  

1765
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:28,185
expression editor,              
view controller, okay?          

1766
01:19:28,253 --> 01:19:32,188
Then I wanna Prep my            
popoverPresentationController   

1767
01:19:32,257 --> 01:19:33,289
so I'm the delegate.            

1768
01:19:33,358 --> 01:19:34,157
So I'm gonna say,               

1769
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:40,562
if I can let the                
popoverPresentationController,  

1770
01:19:40,631 --> 01:19:46,668
= segue, Destinations popover   
presentation controller.        

1771
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:48,736
Remember that the presentation  
controller is always            

1772
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:50,672
on the thing being presented,   

1773
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:53,507
it's controlling                
the presentation itself.        

1774
01:19:53,576 --> 01:19:54,608
Not the thing that's            
presenting, but                 

1775
01:19:54,677 --> 01:19:56,677
the thing presented.            

1776
01:19:56,746 --> 01:19:58,177
So now I'm just gonna           
tell this popover               

1777
01:19:58,246 --> 01:20:03,115
presentation controller to set  
delegate to be myself, okay?    

1778
01:20:03,184 --> 01:20:04,717
And then of course I            
have to go up here and          

1779
01:20:04,785 --> 01:20:06,986
say I'm a UI popover.           

1780
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:09,420
Presentation controller         
delegates.                      

1781
01:20:09,489 --> 01:20:10,855
All the methods are optional,   
so                              

1782
01:20:10,924 --> 01:20:14,192
I am nicely implementing that.  

1783
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,325
But I'm going to                
implement the one,              

1784
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,128
which is this adaption,         
adaptive behavior thing.        

1785
01:20:18,197 --> 01:20:22,266
It's called adaptive            
presentation style for          

1786
01:20:22,334 --> 01:20:23,900
view controller,                
trait collection.               

1787
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:26,169
Right here,                     

1788
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:29,238
well maybe arguments            
a little easier to see.         

1789
01:20:32,943 --> 01:20:36,678
Okay, so this is the thing      
where it's asking the pop over  

1790
01:20:36,746 --> 01:20:38,346
presentation manager,           

1791
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:41,782
hey do you wanna control        
the adapting behavior?          

1792
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:44,084
Right, how it adapts,           
and I do.                       

1793
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:45,452
And what is it                  
that I wanna do?                

1794
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,120
Well, when it's in              
landscape mode in iPhone,       

1795
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:49,555
I want it to be pop over.       

1796
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:52,024
So basically what is            
the traitCollection             

1797
01:20:52,093 --> 01:20:54,126
of the iPhone in                
landscape mode?                 

1798
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:55,694
It's vertically compact.        

1799
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:58,330
It's the only case that's       
vertically compact.             

1800
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:00,698
No other device has             
vertically compact.             

1801
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:03,401
So I'm gonna, just gonna say    
if the traitCollection, okay,   

1802
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:06,269
cuz that's passed along to me   
here as an argument, if I,      

1803
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:11,174
I'm gonna say if it             
verticalSizeClass = compact,    

1804
01:21:11,243 --> 01:21:13,342
then what's the adaptation      
mode I want?                    

1805
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:17,080
.none, do not adapt.            

1806
01:21:17,148 --> 01:21:20,082
Just be your normal             
pop over self.                  

1807
01:21:20,151 --> 01:21:23,185
However, if                     
the traitCollection             

1808
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:29,024
horizontalSizeClass is          
compact, I do want to adapt.    

1809
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:31,592
In fact, I wanna adapt          
to overFullScreen.              

1810
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:35,329
By the way, overFullScreen      
means full screen and           

1811
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:38,632
don't show the view             
controller behind it,           

1812
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:42,136
over, what you call,            
full screen,                    

1813
01:21:42,204 --> 01:21:45,739
just .FullScreen is go          
over the whole screen.          

1814
01:21:45,808 --> 01:21:48,407
But let the one that I'm        
on top of show through, and     

1815
01:21:48,476 --> 01:21:51,510
usually if we do that one, we   
blur, we put a blur background  

1816
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:54,313
or something like that,         
you might check out UI visual   

1817
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:57,215
effects, if you wanna do        
that in your final project.     

1818
01:21:57,284 --> 01:21:59,084
UI visual effects great         
way to do a blur.               

1819
01:22:00,387 --> 01:22:01,819
Otherwise I'm                   
gonna return none,              

1820
01:22:01,888 --> 01:22:04,788
because otherwise I'm regular   
width or height or something.   

1821
01:22:04,857 --> 01:22:07,157
I'm on an iPad                  
basically probably or           

1822
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:11,862
maybe I'm on an iPhone 6+ or    
something like that.            

1823
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:15,097
iPhone 7+ but I don't wanna     
adapt in those cases either.    

1824
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:17,367
All right, so this will         
control the adapted behavior.   

1825
01:22:17,436 --> 01:22:19,902
But one thing I have            
here is destination,            

1826
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,105
we don't want destination       
because the destination         

1827
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:26,441
of this segue is a UI           
navigation controller okay?     

1828
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:29,477
We want here this destination   
view controller that we         

1829
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:32,647
calculated by looking inside    
the navigation controller, so   

1830
01:22:32,716 --> 01:22:34,916
this is destination             
view controller.                

1831
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:38,252
Okay so now let's run this.     

1832
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:43,323
Oops,                           
>> No segue dot.                

1833
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,490
>> No segue dot, yeah.          

1834
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:48,459
Okay, there we go.              

1835
01:22:48,528 --> 01:22:51,196
So we've got our destination    
view controller B in this       

1836
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,998
expression, then we're going    
to become the pop-over          

1837
01:22:54,067 --> 01:22:55,833
presentation for                
those delegates.                

1838
01:22:55,901 --> 01:22:58,502
And we'll implement this        
adapted behavior where we       

1839
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:01,605
don't do it, in the case where  
we're vertically compact.       

1840
01:23:01,673 --> 01:23:03,806
So here this one,               
is vertically regular, so       

1841
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,541
it's not doing that.            

1842
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,677
But in here,                    
we're vertically compact, so    

1843
01:23:07,746 --> 01:23:09,478
this shows up as a pop-over.    

1844
01:23:10,748 --> 01:23:13,114
Right?                          

1845
01:23:13,183 --> 01:23:13,881
long today.                     

1846
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,584
And I will, see you Wednesday.  

1847
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:27,261
