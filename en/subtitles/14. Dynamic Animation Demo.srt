Stanford University.            

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:11,475
>> All right, well welcome to   
Stanford CS193P developing      

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,311
applications for                
iOS Winter 2017.                

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,180
This is Lecture 15, I think.    

6
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:19,015
Yeah, 14, something like that.  

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,717
And today is all demo.          

8
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,720
We're gonna do a demo of this   
dynamic animation stuff.        

9
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,988
And I'm gonna cover             
push behaviors, and             

10
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:29,958
collision behaviors, and        
dynamic item behaviors,         

11
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:32,793
collision delegates,            
gravity behaviors, etc.         

12
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:34,862
I'm not gonna get               
back to the slides.             

13
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:37,597
So, let me talk about what's    
coming up now which is we       

14
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,032
have no section this week.      

15
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:39,932
And then next week,             

16
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,435
I actually posted what I'm      
gonna talk about next week.     

17
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:45,504
But it's application            
lifecycle, alerts and action    

18
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:49,542
sheets, segues, might even get  
core motion to fit in there.    

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,644
I'll try and cover as much of   
the general infrastructure      

20
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:55,180
stuff that might help you,      
with your assignment.           

21
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,251
Okay, so                        
let's get right to the demo.    

22
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:05,723
And this, now, we're demoing    
Dynamic Animator here.          

23
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,259
And generally, dynamic          
animation is mostly used to     

24
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:13,062
animate things that are         
happening in your UI normally.  

25
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,831
And I use that example of when  
you swipe up from the bottom    

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,034
on your iPhone and it brings    
that little UI view comes up.   

27
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:22,170
And it kinda bounces a bit and  
then sits steady.               

28
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,541
That is really what dynamic     
animation kind of is used for   

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,410
You wouldn't probably use it    
for building a video game,      

30
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,211
the most.                       

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,846
even though that's the demo     
I'm gonna do today.             

32
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,782
There are other things          
like Spy Kid and                

33
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:37,117
things like that that           
you might use for that.         

34
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,320
But I like doing the video      
game because this is kinda fun  

35
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:43,589
and it also as a opportunity    
for me to quickly and densely   

36
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:46,458
show you lots of different      
kinds of behaviors and          

37
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:47,793
how they work.                  

38
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:52,797
So, we're gonna build           
a space game, asteroid game.    

39
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:55,400
We're just gonna have a field   
of asteroids flying by, and     

40
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,335
we're gonna have a ship         
in the middle, and              

41
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:58,970
our ship is gonna               
have some shields.              

42
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,405
And every time an asteroid      
hits the shields,               

43
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,674
the shields will turn on and    
get depleted.                   

44
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:06,443
And eventually our ship         
will probably be destroyed      

45
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,077
from too many asteroid hits.    

46
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:10,880
And, we're gonna be able to do  
all of those behaviors that I   

47
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,747
mentioned before.               

48
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:15,984
So, let's get started here,     
I'm gonna create a new app.     

49
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:21,756
I'm gonna call this             
app asteroids and               

50
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:25,193
we'll make it work on both      
iPad and all the iPhones.       

51
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,260
That's no problem for           
this one and                    

52
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,729
I'll put it in the same place   
that I always put everything.   

53
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:32,164
Now I wanna focus all my        

54
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:35,034
demonstration time here on      
the dynamic animation stuff.    

55
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,603
So, this is one of those demos  
where I actually do have some   

56
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:40,572
code and                        
some stuff I'm gonna drag in.   

57
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,208
I'll show it to you briefly,    
but it's mostly just            

58
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:47,078
drawing things, drawing         
the ship, drawing an asteroid.  

59
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,380
And, all the animations         
stuff that we're gonna do,      

60
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,483
100% of it is gonna be in code  
that I do in the demo here.     

61
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:57,254
So, let's start by moving some  
of these things out of the way  

62
00:02:57,322 --> 00:03:01,125
as we usually do, put these     
things in supporting files.     

63
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:05,728
Just to clean up what           
we're looking at here.          

64
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:07,564
I'll even put main              
storyboard up here.             

65
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:10,966
Now, I've left XC Assets        
out of supporting files at      

66
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,401
Cuz I actually am going to      
have some assets, some image    

67
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,768
the time.                       

68
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:16,905
assets, specifically my         
asteroids and my ship.          

69
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:21,175
So, let's drag those in, so     
I'm just gonna go over here to  

70
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,177
this little directory           
I have of stuff.                

71
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,013
And you can see that I've got   
some kind of random pictures    

72
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,047
of asteroids here.              

73
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,715
And I'm just gonna take         
these asteroids and             

74
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,684
add them to my                  
images down here.               

75
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,385
I'm gonna do it for explosion,  

76
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,321
also my ship knows how to       
explode, so we'll have that.    

77
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,555
And then here's my ship,        

78
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,892
cute little ship, here's where  
it's, it's engines are firing.  

79
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,460
Okay, so we have those          
two images right there.         

80
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:47,398
Now when you drag images into   
your XE assets you'll see that  

81
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,168
they have a one times, a two    
times and a three times slot.   

82
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:53,737
And that's talking              
about the resolution.           

83
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,072
Okay, it's really talking       
about the number of pixels per  

84
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,339
point, okay?                    

85
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,007
In the size of the image.       

86
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,208
Normally you're gonna           
have all three.                 

87
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:03,011
I'm only gonna use the 1x       
because my 1x is pretty high    

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,746
resolution, it'll look          
fine on 2x and 3x.              

89
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:07,114
But if you got a real app,      

90
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,784
you'd wanna pick resolutions    
at these different sizes.       

91
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,987
Because it allows a one X       
app to be much smaller,         

92
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:16,156
cuz obviously a lower           
resolution is much smaller.     

93
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,824
And it's really                 
cool actually when              

94
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,325
people download things          
from the App Store.             

95
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:22,228
You only get the resolutions    
that are appropriate            

96
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:22,828
for your device.                

97
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,862
So, it's kind of fun.           

98
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,797
You don't get all that extra    
junk that you don't need.       

99
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,666
So anyway, so                   
those are my images.            

100
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,567
And then I do have              
a bit of code here too,         

101
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,202
at least four files.            

102
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:35,138
Just like I said we're          
gonna take a look at here.      

103
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:40,010
Drag those in and               
we will copy them, yes.         

104
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,311
All right, so let's look at     

105
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,846
the code we just                
dragged in there.               

106
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,448
First one here is               
asteroid view.                  

107
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,784
This is the entire thing that   
you see on the screen right     

108
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:53,186
here, very simple little        
subclass of UI image view.      

109
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:56,757
It just picks a random one of   
those asteroids images, right?  

110
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,992
See these asteroid images one,  
two through asteroid nine,      

111
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,961
this thing just picks           
one of those and                

112
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,562
makes an image view out of it.  

113
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:07,199
Okay, that's all AsteriodView   
is, so that looks really easy   

114
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:10,035
when we move that into          
supporting files as well.       

115
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:14,506
Here is a little exte, file     
of extensions that I made to    

116
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:18,943
CGFloat, and CGSize and         
CGRect, and CGPoint.            

117
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:21,812
And these are just little       
convenience functions, like     

118
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,781
here's the area of a CGSize     
right just with time height.    

119
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,351
Or here's a CG float, it        
generates a random number in    

120
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,554
a certain range of floats       
which is kind of cool.          

121
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,923
A random float,                 
okay and returns it.            

122
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,424
Here's CGRect.                  

123
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,726
I have a random point which     
generates a random point        

124
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,060
inside the rectangle anywhere.  

125
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,729
Cuz obviously I'm               

126
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,998
It's nice to have a little,     
var here,                       

127
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,666
random points, for rect.        

128
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,935
So, you can go look             
at these later,                 

129
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,837
as I'm writing the code,        
I'll try and reference          

130
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,706
these are one of my little      
CGRect extensions that I did.   

131
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,076
And I do this but I think my    
code reads a lot nicer when I,  

132
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,895
kinda condense this math into   
these nice little, extensions.  

133
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,646
you know,                       

134
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,548
But all of these make perfect   
sense as extensions of          

135
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,415
each of their classes.          

136
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,017
None of them are spaceship or   

137
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,753
asteroid specific extensions    
to core graphics.               

138
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:13,289
So, move that to                
supporting files as well.       

139
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,558
Then next we have               
the spaceship view.             

140
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:16,392
Okay, the spaceship view        

141
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,894
just draws that little          
spaceship I showed you.         

142
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,663
It knows how to draw it         
with the little flame           

143
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,665
coming out the back if          
the engines are firing.         

144
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,500
This is the entire public       
API of it right here,           

145
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,134
this is the only                
API we'll be using.             

146
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,937
So, that's just a bully that    
turns on that little fire       

147
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,039
coming out the back or          
not is all it does.             

148
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,841
Direction is the direction      
the ship is pointing and        

149
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,811
that's you know zero to two     
pi, so it's in radians.         

150
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,514
You know, we've hopefully       
learned by now the zero two pi  

151
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:45,884
circle where zero is out to     
the right and we go around.     

152
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:48,921
Shield level, so this ship has  
a little round shield around    

153
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,155
it and the shield level goes    
from zero to a hundred.         

154
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:52,490
When a hundred,                 
it's a full shield and          

155
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,591
it doesn't even                 
show the shield.                

156
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,693
But as soon as                  
the shield gets damaged,        

157
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:58,161
It kinda shows the shield       
partially damaged,              

158
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,033
until you get to shield level   
zero, the ship explodes, okay?  

159
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,835
This shield is active,          
it's purely a drawing thing.    

160
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:08,571
When the shield is active it    
kinda glows a little bit.       

161
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,406
And so,                         
we're gonna have our ship,      

162
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,242
just to make our UI simple,     
it's going to automatically     

163
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,811
turn it's shields on when       
an asteroid impacts it.         

164
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,346
Okay, so we're kind of          
a auto shield deployment, so    

165
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,314
we're gonna turn this on so     
we can see it,                  

166
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,549
the asteroids causing           
the shields to turn on.         

167
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:26,486
And then finally there's this   
little shield boundary guy,     

168
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:29,623
that just gives us              
a UIBezierPath that describes   

169
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:30,490
the shield.                     

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,625
It's just gonna be a simple     
arc around because              

171
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,560
it's a circle,                  
just gives us that back.        

172
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,329
Notice that it can give it to   
us in any views coordinate      

173
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:40,366
space and that's because we're  
gonna find that when we do      

174
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,032
animation.                      

175
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:42,900
We're gonna specify             
a reference view for            

176
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,068
all of our animation, and       

177
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,036
when we have these              
things like boundaries.         

178
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:48,371
We have to always specify       
them in that reference view's   

179
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,272
coordinate system.              

180
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,542
So, if we're gonna get the      
boundary of the ship's shields  

181
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,177
as a UIBezierPath,              

182
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,578
it has to be in the right       
coordinate system.              

183
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,414
So, that's why it has this in   
view argument right there, but  

184
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,650
it's just returned to           
UIBezierPath Okay so that's     

185
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,786
the spaceship view I can        
do anything else with that.     

186
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:09,056
And then here is the last one   
the asteroid field view this    

187
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,958
is the entire                   
thing right here.               

188
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:14,427
It only have one method in it,  
which is add some asteroids.    

189
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,996
Okay, and all this code here    
is doing is just putting        

190
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,699
a random sized asteroid at      

191
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,634
a random point                  
inside it's bounds.             

192
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:25,037
Okay, so really very            
super simple right here.        

193
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,539
It does have this little thing  
of exclusion zone where it      

194
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,973
won't put an asteroid there,    
and                             

195
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,275
you'll see why we want that.    

196
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,475
We don't wanna put              
an asteroid on top of           

197
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,310
our ship when we start.         

198
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,778
Now this one I'm not gonna put  
in supporting files, cuz we     

199
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,315
are gonna actually add a small  
amount of code to this guide.   

200
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,683
Because we want our             
asteroid behaviors,             

201
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:44,186
how our asteroids behave using  
dynamic animation to apply to   

202
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:45,487
all of our asteroids.           

203
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:47,923
And so we're gonna end          
up adding a var here so         

204
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,625
we can set the asteroid         
behavior in this asteroid       

205
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:53,861
field view as you               
might have imagined.            

206
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,797
Okay, so I'm gonna rename       
my generic view controller      

207
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,066
here to be asteroid's           
view controller,                

208
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,835
just good review of how         
we do that by the way.          

209
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:04,504
We have to do kinda             
four things again,              

210
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:05,571
I renamed the comment.          

211
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,975
The actual name of the class,   
I'm gonna rename the file,      

212
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:13,479
gonna be typing the word        
asteroid a lot today.           

213
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:17,081
And I'm gonna go to             
the storyboard of course, and   

214
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,550
select this thing.              

215
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:21,018
And make sure that it's         
identity over here is not       

216
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:24,788
generic view controller, it's   
asteroids view controller.      

217
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,024
Okay, everybody remembers that  
how to change things pretty     

218
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,876
And then don't need any         
of this code for now.           

219
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,660
easy to do.                     

220
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,630
And also obviously as you       
imagine when you do a game you  

221
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,098
have a lot of constants.        

222
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,266
Okay, constants for             
ship acceleration and           

223
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,767
the size of things, whatever.   

224
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,135
So I have a bunch               
of constants,                   

225
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:43,571
which I'm going                 
to type in here.                

226
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:48,141
And I'm gonna go over these     
constants as I use them.        

227
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,909
But like I say,                 
burnAcceleration,               

228
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,078
initialAsteroidCount, these     
kind of things so               

229
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:55,381
pretty obvious what most        
of these constants are.         

230
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,617
Okay, so now we're all set      
up to write our app and         

231
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:04,422
focus on our UI dynamic         
animation that we need to do.   

232
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:09,126
The first thing I'm gonna do    
is put the asteroid field view  

233
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,761
in my self dot view.            

234
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,163
Okay, so basically put it       
onscreen, and I'm gonna do      

235
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,399
that in code instead of         
doing it in the storyboard.     

236
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,967
But it's pretty straight        
forward I'm gonna have          

237
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,603
a private var which is gonna    
be my asteroid field and        

238
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,738
it's gonna be type              
AsteroidFieldView.              

239
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:26,242
Okay that's this thing right    
here that I showed you that,    

240
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,844
we know how to add              
asteroids to right there.       

241
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:31,746
And I'm gonna make this         
implicitly unwrap optional      

242
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,982
because once I initialize that  
field it always gonna be set    

243
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,017
for the entire                  
lifetime of this MVC.           

244
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:40,487
So It's okay to make it         
implicitly wrapped after all.   

245
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,123
I just have to be a little      
bit careful just like with      

246
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,924
an outlet, not to access this.  

247
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:48,728
Or at least to check that it's  
nil before I initialize it.     

248
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,596
And when am I gonna             
initialize it?                  

249
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:53,566
I'm actually gonna initialize   
it in viewDidAppear.            

250
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:57,936
Okay, so in viewDidAppear I'm   
gonna initialize this and       

251
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,737
why am I doing it there?        

252
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:03,240
Well, I really don't need to    
do it before then, right?       

253
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,110
Until my view appears, I don't  
really need to initialize its   

254
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,878
asteroid field and              
all that stuff.                 

255
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,980
Also it's nice in               
viewDidAppear,                  

256
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,915
all your bounds are set,        
right?                          

257
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:14,683
Your geometry is all set up so  
you can count on that.          

258
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,353
But I'm not gonna rely on that  
because I'm also gonna have my  

259
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,220
asteroid field thing            
work when I rotate.             

260
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,457
So I'm also gonna have to kind  
of adjust my asteroid field in  

261
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,959
my viewDid layout subviews,     
right?                          

262
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,128
Cuz that's tells me that        
my balance have changed.        

263
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,695
So I'm gonna do both.           

264
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:30,630
So all I'm gonna do here in     
viewDidAppear is I'm gonna      

265
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,866
call something called           
initializeIfNeeded,             

266
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,201
cuz it might not be needed.     

267
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,771
Remember that viewDidAppear     
gets called multiple times cuz  

268
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
it could appear then go away,   
then come back and go away.     

269
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,441
So I'm gonna initialize         
the first time.                 

270
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,844
So I'm going to initialize      
IfNeeded and so                 

271
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,613
I have this private func for    
that.                           

272
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,982
Initialize if needed and        

273
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:56,320
if the If needed part is just   
if the asteroidField is nil,    

274
00:11:56,388 --> 00:12:01,658
then I need to initialize       
the asteroidField.              

275
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:05,528
Okay, so everybody cool with    
where we stand right now?       

276
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,197
So what do we need to do to     
create this asteroid field is   

277
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:10,199
just a UIView, so               
I'm gonna create it and         

278
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,367
I'm gonna say AsteroidField.    

279
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,402
So make some more space here.   

280
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,771
Just get a little wide here.    

281
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,177
It's an AsteroidFieldView,      
AsteroidFieldView, okay?        

282
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:23,278
View.                           

283
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:25,646
Capital A.                      

284
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,214
All right.                      
[LAUGH] And a view?             

285
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:28,282
How do we create a view?        

286
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,517
Well, we're just gonna          
use a normal frame              

287
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,851
initializer there.              

288
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,121
And what is the rectangle       
of my field, my view here?      

289
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,690
I'm actually gonna              
start by having my              

290
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,224
entire asteroid field.          

291
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,393
Fit inside my views balance so  
you can see the whole thing.    

292
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,295
But when I really get           
going with my game,             

293
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,397
I'm gonna make the Azure        
feel quite large.               

294
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,933
So that my ship has a lot       
of space to fly around in.      

295
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,302
And then I'm gonna use          
a little bit trick,             

296
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,438
gaming design trick to make     
it so that it seems infinite.   

297
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:59,242
But of course I can't build     
an infinitely large view.       

298
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,312
So, I'm going to build          
this with a rect that           

299
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,649
is centered at my self          
dot views bounds mid.           

300
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:11,119
So mid is something I added     
in my CGRectit extensions.      

301
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,221
It just gives you               
the mid point of it.            

302
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,724
And my size is gonna be         
my view.bounds.size.            

303
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,993
Okay now I'm gonna start it     
out there as in the center,     

304
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,929
cover my whole                  
view again just so              

305
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:24,097
you can see what's              
going on there.                 

306
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,333
And one more parenthesis.       

307
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:28,567
What else do we need to do?     

308
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,770
We need to add it               
as a sub view.                  

309
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:32,671
Okay, so I'm just going to      
add this asteroid field,        

310
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:35,072
this sub view of                
my self dot view.               

311
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,741
I'm gonna control               
over here and                   

312
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,244
then let's add some asteroids,  
asteroidfield.addasteroids.     

313
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:43,981
We'll add 20 asteroids, that's  
a good number of asteroids.     

314
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,984
I think it might even           
have a constance for            

315
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:52,455
this,                           
constant.initialAsteroidCount.  

316
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:53,022
Initial yeah,                   
initial asteroid account        

317
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:53,723
that's better,                  
add a constant there.           

318
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,762
The other thing like I said     
is when my bounds changed,      

319
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,697
I wanna make sure I             
move my asteroid field          

320
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,999
always to the center            
of my new bounds.               

321
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,535
Now that's gonna be a little    
funny now because my as,my      

322
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,903
field is gonna start out,       
in this you know,               

323
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,405
the bound size that             
I started out with.             

324
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:13,373
And I'm not gonna change it,    
but                             

325
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,409
when I make my bounds really    
big I'll make it so big.        

326
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,878
That no matter what I           
rotate my device to             

327
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,479
it'll always be showing         
part of the field, so           

328
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:22,247
I don't worry about             
that too much.                  

329
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:26,217
All I'll do for now is in       
viewdDidLayoutSubviews,         

330
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:31,089
I'll just make sure to always   
recenter myself by saying that  

331
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,092
my asteroidfield is center.     

332
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,461
Equals my bounds mid, right.    

333
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,197
So just always put it           
back in the middle.             

334
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,467
Okay, everybody cool,           
what I've done so far?          

335
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:45,935
All I did was created           
this asteroid view.             

336
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,170
Let's run it and see what our   
asteroid field looks like.      

337
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:53,207
It's just going to be           
a bunch of randomly sized and   

338
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,478
positioned asteroids,           
popped in there.                

339
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,087
All right, here it is.          

340
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,256
Okay, here's my iPhone 7 plus.  

341
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,190
Nice big one.                   

342
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,759
And you can see I've got all    
these randomly sized and        

343
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,460
shaped and you know,            
different ones.                 

344
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,862
Those nine different            
asteroids in here.              

345
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:19,731
Now, it's time to learn         
about dynamic animation.        

346
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,567
We're going to make             
these things move.              

347
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,935
Now, how do we make these       
asteroids start floating        

348
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:24,803
around in space?                

349
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:28,005
And the answer is we're         
going to push them.             

350
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,040
We're gonna use                 
a push behavior and             

351
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:33,343
give it an instantaneous push   
to this things just fly off.    

352
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,345
So we push them all a random    
amount in a random direction.   

353
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,114
So they all starting to moving  
it all a different directions.  

354
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:43,119
Now to do that animation we     
always need this top level      

355
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,821
thing which is an animator,     
okay.                           

356
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,890
The animator thing that         
controls all the animations.    

357
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,193
So you field that animation,    
you always gonna had            

358
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:55,896
a private var which is you      
usually called the animator.    

359
00:15:55,965 --> 00:16:00,234
Which is going to be            
a UI dynamic animator.          

360
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:02,203
Animator.                       

361
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:08,441
And its initializer             
takes a reference view.         

362
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,843
And this reference view is      
just defining the coordinate    

363
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:13,579
system that all the boundaries  
for collisions and              

364
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,181
things like that                
are gonna occur in.             

365
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,583
Now what I want this            
reference view to be is my      

366
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:18,716
asteroid field.                 

367
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,051
That makes the most sense,      
right.                          

368
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,786
Everything's an asteroid        
field, that's a good view.      

369
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,121
I can choose really any         
view that's high up             

370
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,423
in the hierarchy that           
I wanna animate.                

371
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:29,158
Now, here we're having the      
same exact problem we had in    

372
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:31,794
the last demo where I'm trying  
to initialize a var and         

373
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,663
in part of the initialization,  
I'm trying to use a var and     

374
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:35,932
we know we can't do that.       

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,866
We can't use any                
of our own vars or              

376
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:40,702
funcs untill we fully           
initialize ourself.             

377
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:43,138
So, we're gonna do lazy.        

378
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:44,772
And we know that when we        
do this lazy approach,          

379
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,974
we have to explicitly type.     

380
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:50,010
We can't use the static typer.  

381
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,878
Here, animator.                 

382
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:54,414
And also we know that if        
we just say asteroid field,     

383
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:55,848
it's gonna be looking for       
a static.                       

384
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,416
A class.                        

385
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,617
Method called asteroid field.   

386
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,552
So to tell it we want           
an instance one,                

387
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,454
we're gonna say self.asteroid.  

388
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,255
And this is gonna work because  
it's gonna be lazy, and so      

389
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,325
it's not gona actually execute  
this initialize in here until   

390
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,061
somebody asks for it, and       
nobody's allowed to ask for     

391
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,063
it until we're fully            
initialized; and                

392
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,565
thus we've gotten out           
of the conundrum there.         

393
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,567
Okay, everybody                 
cool with that?                 

394
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,236
So now we have an animator.     

395
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:21,937
What's the next                 
step in animation?              

396
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:22,804
Behaviors.                      

397
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:23,838
We have to create behaviors.    

398
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,139
And so, our                     

399
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,307
asteroids are gonna have        
a lot of behaviors on them.     

400
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,008
Okay?                           
They're gonna be colliding      

401
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:31,311
with things,                    
they're gonna get pushed,       

402
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:34,380
they're gonna have general      
kind of physics, they're even,  

403
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,416
when the ship is accelerating   
through space, they're gonna    

404
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:40,252
even be experiencing opposite   
direction acceleration.         

405
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,622
So we're gonna combine          
all of those into one,          

406
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,323
single behavior.                

407
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:48,359
Okay, a subclause behavior,     
and that subclause behavior is  

408
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,629
gonna be a composite of all     
those other kind of behaviors.  

409
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:52,429
So let's do that right now.     

410
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:55,599
Let's go File > New and         
create a new                    

411
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:58,001
class which is gonna be         
a UI dynamic behavior.          

412
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,837
You see it says Subclass        
of: UIDynamicBehavior here.     

413
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:01,971
I'm gonna call it               

414
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,772
AsteriodBehavior because        
that's what it is.              

415
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,572
It's the behavior.              

416
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,742
It's gonna collect all the      
behavior that has to do with    

417
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,809
asteroids.                      

418
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,043
Put it where I put              
everything here.                

419
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:12,746
And so                          
here's my dynamic behavior.     

420
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:16,249
All I'm gonna do to start       
is have an add asteroid and     

421
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,919
a remove asteroid method so     
I can collect                   

422
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:22,655
the asteroids then I am         
causing to behave somehow.      

423
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:26,058
So let's have a private var     
which we'll call asteroids.     

424
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,893
And it's just gonna             
be an array of                  

425
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,361
asteroids views, okay.          

426
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,163
And then, we'll have a private  
or actually a public funk       

427
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:36,267
called addAsteroid and you are  
gonna give it an asteroid and   

428
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:39,737
it is just going to add         
this asteroid, okay.            

429
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:44,541
Pin this asteroid on            
to the Our dictionary,          

430
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,410
our array of asteroids here.    

431
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,280
And then we're also gonna       
have removeAsteroid.            

432
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:55,085
And this one has to first make  
sure that we actually have      

433
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:58,754
this asteroid by saying         
if we can let index             

434
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:02,924
= asteroids.index of            
this asteroid, okay?            

435
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,861
If we can find it               
in there then we're             

436
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,365
just gonna say asteroids        
remove at that index.           

437
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,500
Okay, so this is it so          
far for our behavior.           

438
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,103
It's not actually doing any     
behavior but now we can add     

439
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,104
asteroids or remove             
asteroids from the behavior.    

440
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,940
Which is a critical             
part of animation,              

441
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,341
remember there's                
always three steps.             

442
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,010
Got the animator, you add       
the behaviors to the animator,  

443
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,179
then you add the items,         
the asteroids in this case,     

444
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,580
to the behaviors.               

445
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:32,083
And so this is, we've gone      
all three of those steps.       

446
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:34,819
Now we haven't actually picked  
any behaviors to composite,     

447
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:36,954
to build our thing out of yet.  

448
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,857
But at least we've got          
the infrastructure to do that.  

449
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:42,693
Now, now we have                
a behavior here,                

450
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,061
let's go back to our            
view controller and             

451
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,164
create one of these behaviors,  
instantiate one, okay?          

452
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,333
And add it to our animator.     

453
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,768
So we can instantiate one       
by just saying private var      

454
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:58,073
asteroidBehavior =              
asteroidBehavior.               

455
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,676
Behavior, all right, so         

456
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:02,777
we've just created              
an asteroid behavior.           

457
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:04,912
But it won't do anything,       
that behavior,                  

458
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,481
whatever we tell it teach       
to do eventually, it won't      

459
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:10,216
anything to the asteroid until  
we add it to an animator.       

460
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:15,255
Now when is it a good time to   
add a behavior to an animator?  

461
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:18,391
Well you really only            
want animation to go on         

462
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,993
when you're on screen.          

463
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:23,195
Okay, if you're not on screen,  
animating things probably,      

464
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,897
99% of the time does            
not make any sense.             

465
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:29,334
So, kind of a cool place to     
do it is in viewDidAppear.      

466
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:33,638
So when my view appears, I am   
going to tell my animator to,   

467
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:37,409
mator, to add behavior,         
my asteroid behavior.           

468
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,845
Okay, now,                      
when do I wanna remove it?      

469
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:43,814
Well, I wanna remove            
it when I disappear.            

470
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:47,216
So in, view will disappear.     

471
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:48,250
No, that's not even close.      

472
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,585
View will disappear.            

473
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:54,056
super.view will disappear.      

474
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:59,494
[SOUND] Animated.               

475
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,763
Here I'm just gonna             
say to my animator,             

476
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:03,431
remove this behavior.           

477
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:06,400
And as soon as I move           
a behavior from an animator,    

478
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:08,568
it will stop animating          
that behavior, okay?            

479
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,571
In other words that behavior    
will no longer apply            

480
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,306
to the animation                
that's going on.                

481
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,208
Now I can put it back and       
it'll start animating again.    

482
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,409
One thing that's                
interesting to note though,     

483
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:19,311
all the items that              
are being animated,             

484
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,212
if you take an animator         
out of an animator,             

485
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,182
they'll lose all their linear   
velocity, they'll stop moving.  

486
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,017
So if you add it back,          
they'll all be stuck.           

487
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,886
You'll have to repush them or   
reestablish                     

488
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,155
their linear velocities or      
something like that.            

489
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,456
Okay, that's the only           
bad part about stopping.        

490
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,125
You can't really this is not    
really pausing the animation,   

491
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,126
it's stopping.                  

492
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,628
All forces stop on              
things being animated.          

493
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:40,962
And then when you add it back,  

494
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,363
they all start                  
re-playing again.               

495
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:44,332
But if the ship were            
accelerating when               

496
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,399
And you come back and           
the ship keeps accelerating.    

497
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,399
you removed it.                 

498
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,936
It will, those things will      
still be accelerating.          

499
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,171
So will be effective.           

500
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,773
So now we've added              
the asteroid behavior to        

501
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:54,374
the animator.                   

502
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:55,274
What's the next step?           

503
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:58,143
We gotta add the asteroids      
to the behavior.                

504
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,511
Okay, if you don't add          
the asteroids to the behavior,  

505
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,211
nothing's gonna happen.         

506
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,181
And I'm actually gonna have my  
asteroid field view do that,    

507
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,283
cuz it's the thing that         
creates the asteroids.          

508
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:07,718
And so it kinda works for       

509
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:10,887
the architecture of my app      
if I only have it to deal       

510
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,757
with the asteroids and I don't  
actually have to deal with any  

511
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,758
of the asteroids at all         
in my view controller,          

512
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:16,959
that's kinda cool.              

513
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:20,228
So I'm gonna go back            
over to my asteroid             

514
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,533
field view right here, and I'm  
gonna add a public var here.    

515
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:27,936
Which is the asteroidBehavior   
that I want to apply            

516
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:31,406
to all of my asteroids.         

517
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:35,042
So we'll have                   
an asteroidBehavior of course.  

518
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,276
We'll have it be optional,      

519
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:38,779
because maybe my asteroids      
are just sitting there, not,    

520
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,981
not behaving, no one's,         
that sort of behavior,          

521
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,082
they don't do anything,         
they just sit there.            

522
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,349
That's probably fine.           

523
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,385
When someone sets this, okay?   

524
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:50,421
Someone sets my behavior,       
I want to remove                

525
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,725
all my asteroids from any       
previous behavior I had and     

526
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:55,493
add them to the new behavior,   
okay?                           

527
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:58,362
I don't wanna set this          
asteroid behavior,              

528
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:01,231
I don't want any old            
behavior still be behaving.     

529
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,801
So, I'm actually gonna go       
through all of my asteroids     

530
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:09,472
here for asteroid in            
asteroids, oops, in asteroids.  

531
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,943
And for each one, if I had      
an old value that was not nil,  

532
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:18,181
an old behavior, then I'm       
gonna remove this asteroid.     

533
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:23,384
And similarly, for              
the new value,                  

534
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:25,654
the new asteroid                
behavior that I have.           

535
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:29,057
If that's not nil,              
then I will add asteroid.       

536
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:34,095
Okay, now what about this       
little var right here,          

537
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:34,995
asteroid?                       

538
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,129
Where are all my asteroids?     

539
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:38,030
I don't have a var here for     
my asteroids.                   

540
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,665
I actually waited to do         

541
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,566
this instead of just putting    
it in advance cuz I wanna show  

542
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,801
you some kind of                
a cool way to do this.          

543
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,371
I'm gonna have a private        
var asteroids.                  

544
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:50,307
It's gonna be an array          
of asteroid view, and           

545
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:51,375
it's gonna be calculated.       

546
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,109
And the way I'm gonna           
calculate it is,                

547
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:56,579
I'm gonna return all            
my subviews, Okay,              

548
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,315
cuz all my subviews are all     
these asteroids, but            

549
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:02,618
maybe one day I'll add some     
other kind of subview besides   

550
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:05,420
an asteroid, I don't know,      
space station, or something.    

551
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:06,588
And so, I only want             

552
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,690
my subviews that                
are asteroid views.             

553
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,493
So I'm gonna say,               
subviews.flatMap.               

554
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:15,897
Okay, now flatMap takes         
a closure and if that closure   

555
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:19,266
returns nill, it doesn't        
add that to the thing.          

556
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,002
To the return value here and    
if it does doesn't return nil.  

557
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,172
It does and so in other words   
flatmap makes a new array.      

558
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,575
With all of the things in       
the first array but with this   

559
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:31,677
closure executed on them and    
it skips ones that are nil.     

560
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,780
So, I'm just gonna              
say $0 which is each            

561
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:38,084
subview in the array            
as an asteroid view.            

562
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:41,052
Okay, and this will             
return nill of course,          

563
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:42,987
if I have a subview that's      
not a asteroid view.            

564
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:46,290
But all the other ones will     
do that and that makes this     

565
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,294
return value turn into          
a array of asteroid views.      

566
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,329
Okay, so just thought I'd       
show you a flat map there,      

567
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:54,864
kind of fun.                    

568
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,833
All right, so now we have       
this asteroid everything.       

569
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,600
The other thing we probably     
want to do is when we           

570
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:00,402
add a new asteroid.             

571
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,437
If we have our                  
asteroidBehavior set,           

572
00:25:02,506 --> 00:25:04,205
let's go ahead and              
add this asteroid to there.     

573
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:06,474
So, in asteroidBehavior,        

574
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,810
I'm going to add asteroid,      
this asteroid.                  

575
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:14,280
So, you can set the asteroid    
before or after                 

576
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,549
you add the asteroids, it'll    
work either way with this.      

577
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,752
So now, we need to set,         
see this var right here?        

578
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:23,321
We need to set that from        
our controller, so that our     

579
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,059
asteroid field view right here  
knows what behavior to use.     

580
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:29,627
So, we're gonna say here,       

581
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,862
well we'll put it               
even a little higher.           

582
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,497
We'll say asteroid field.       

583
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:40,137
Set your asteroid behavior      
to our AsteroidBehavior.        

584
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,571
And, again, it doesn't matter   
if I do it before here, or      

585
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,772
I could do it after here.       

586
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,508
Either way,                     
it's going to work.             

587
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:48,310
Okay, got that?                 

588
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,645
All right, now we're            
all completely set up.          

589
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,346
We have this behavior,          
custom behavior,                

590
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:53,647
which doesn't do anything yet.  

591
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:56,082
All the asteroids have          
been added to it, okay,         

592
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:57,584
it's been added                 
to an animator.                 

593
00:25:57,652 --> 00:26:00,286
All we need to do now is        
implement our behavior and      

594
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:02,188
however we implement behavior.  

595
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,790
It's gonna start applying       
to all off our asteroid.        

596
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,459
So, I said the first thing      
we want to is push them all.    

597
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,228
So, let's go add                
a pushing behavior to our       

598
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:10,962
asteroid behavior.              

599
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,932
So, heres our asteroid          
behavior, right here.           

600
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,001
Lets at a push behavior,        
and I'm gonna do this push      

601
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,806
behavior by creating a func     
called pushAllAsteroids, okay.  

602
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:26,176
And I'm gonna have an argument  
to this pushAllAsteroids,       

603
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:28,578
which tells how much you        
want me to push them.           

604
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:30,880
It's always gonna push them     
in a random direction, but      

605
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,314
you can say by how much.        

606
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:35,384
And so,                         
I'll call it by magnitude and   

607
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:39,020
I'll even let you specify       
a range of magnitudes to push.  

608
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:40,822
Because you don't want          
to push all of them             

609
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,523
the exact same amount.          

610
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:46,427
So, we'll create a this is      
gonna be a range of a rangle.   

611
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:50,064
No a range of CG float and      
we'll have a default.           

612
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,700
How about the default           
be 0..0.5 so between 0.         

613
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:56,135
Which means don't               
push them at all.               

614
00:26:56,204 --> 00:27:00,773
2.5 which means push            
them a fair amount but          

615
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,573
not really hard.                

616
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:04,143
A one point o push is           
a pretty good push.             

617
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:05,576
And these are the kind,         
I should probably have          

618
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:07,678
a constant for this but these   
are the kind of things you'll   

619
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:10,014
play with these number until    
you kind of get the feel.       

620
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,415
For the animation               
that you want.                  

621
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:13,550
How fast you want them in       
the slide in or how hard for    

622
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,487
something you want something    
to be pushed or whatever.       

623
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:19,556
Okay, so how am i gonna         
push this asteroids?            

624
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,624
I'm gonna do it                 
with push behavior.             

625
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:26,061
So I'm gonna go through         
each of my asteroids, okay?     

626
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,964
And for everyone, I'm gonna     
create a pusher, which is       

627
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:34,402
gonna be a UI UIPushBehavior,   
and the UIPushBehavior's        

628
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,272
creator here is, here,          
is this one, items.             

629
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:39,874
So, a push can actually push    
multiple items at once.         

630
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:40,774
But I don't want that here,     

631
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:42,943
cuz I wanna push all            
20 asteroids, or                

632
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:44,611
all my asteroids,               
in different directions.        

633
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,746
So, I don't wanna push them     
all in the same direction.      

634
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,281
So here I'm just gonna          
have the array have             

635
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:52,551
one thing in it,                

636
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,286
And the mode can                
be continuous,                  

637
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,388
which means I just keep         
on pushing it forever.          

638
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:58,156
So that's basically velocity,   

639
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,591
push behavior that's            
continuous is velocity.         

640
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,994
Or it can be instantaneous,     
which is one push.              

641
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:04,961
And that's what I want here.    

642
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,131
I just want to kinda            
get them started.               

643
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,199
But I'm not gonna keep          
pushing my asteroids around,    

644
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:10,533
I'm just gonna push them        
around, and hopefully,          

645
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:11,334
they're in outer space,         

646
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:13,668
they'll just keep on moving,    
right?                          

647
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:15,770
We'll see if that happens,      
but hopefully it will.          

648
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,007
And so, the pusher's magnitude  
here is how hard you're         

649
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:22,310
pushing it, and so              
I'm gonna make the magnitude    

650
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:25,780
be a random number inside       
that, this range up here,       

651
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:29,684
that's why I have this          
CGFloat random in Range.        

652
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:34,220
Okay, so that's what we do and  
then the angle I'm gonna pick   

653
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:37,756
is also gonna be a random       
number CGFloat.random and       

654
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:43,095
that's gonna be in a range      
of zero to two pie, so they     

655
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:46,265
can push in any angle all the   
way round the arc of radius.    

656
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:51,703
So now, I've set up my pusher,  
I just need to get it to push.  

657
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,704
And how do I get it to push?    

658
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,171
Well, to get it                 
to push I have to               

659
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,573
add it to a dynamic animator,   
okay?                           

660
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:57,708
As soon as I had a,             

661
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,276
any behavior to a dynamic       
animator, it starts.            

662
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:01,311
So here I just need to add it.  

663
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:02,445
And how do I do that?           

664
00:29:02,513 --> 00:29:06,315
Well, here I'm creating a       
subclass of UIDynamicAnimator.  

665
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:08,634
the way we add behaviors        
is we say addChildBehavior.     

666
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:10,885
And so                          

667
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:15,556
Okay, and                       
that adds this pusher,          

668
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:18,459
this one time instantaneous     
push, to our behavior,          

669
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:19,593
the asteroid behavior.          

670
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,528
And of course the asteroid      
behavior has been               

671
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:23,029
added to a dynamic              
animator and                    

672
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:25,731
that causes the push to         
be animated as well.            

673
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,801
So basically all                
the animation gets propagated   

674
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,303
down through our asteroid       
behavior to all our children,   

675
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:32,070
all our child behaviors.        

676
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,238
And we're gonna                 
have quite a few.               

677
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:35,873
Four or                         
five child behaviors here.      

678
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,076
All right, so let's go ahead    
and see if this did anything.   

679
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,747
Wait, one thing we gotta        
do first is call this.          

680
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,182
We never actually called        
pushAllAsteroids, so            

681
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,550
let's do that.                  

682
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:50,118
Let's push them,                
again when we first appear,     

683
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:51,119
we'll give them a push.         

684
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:52,654
So, we'll say push behavior.    

685
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:55,389
And                             
asteroidBehavior.pushAllAster-  

686
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:59,260
oids.                           
And                             

687
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:02,196
We don't really care that       
much as you'll see soon.        

688
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,733
But it's kinda nice to          
give our asteroid some          

689
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:10,203
kind of initial motion in       
space, and you can see there,   

690
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,070
we go, we pushed them.          

691
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:14,373
Now, something bad              
happened though.                

692
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,441
They got pushed                 
out into oblivion.              

693
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:17,575
We lost them all them.          

694
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:19,277
And they're still going but     

695
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:21,111
I think there is                
one over there and              

696
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,613
one way over there, we can't    
see them obviously anywhere on  

697
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,982
our view cuz we pushed          
them all out of our view.       

698
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:27,917
So that's a major               
problem we need to fix.         

699
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,318
It have these things            
go all out of view.             

700
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:30,753
So, we'll fix that.             

701
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:32,454
The second thing, I dont        
know if you noticed here but    

702
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:34,656
they all just started to        
slow down pretty quick.         

703
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:35,824
Okay, they start                
out very fast,                  

704
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,725
then they rapidly slow down.    

705
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,194
Okay, and                       
it space naturally happen.      

706
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:43,530
Now the normal physics          
of the dynamic animator         

707
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,867
a kind of like a table top by   
default, which even know push   

708
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:48,801
something there's some          
friction there, right.          

709
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,536
And so, things will slow down.  

710
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:53,272
And this is not a table top,    
this is outer space.            

711
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,108
So the two things we need to    
fix, is one, keep our things    

712
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:58,744
from flying everywhere, and     
two, make it more like outer    

713
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,878
space, no friction,             
things like that, okay?         

714
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,947
And we're gonna do, fix each    
of those things, which a,       

715
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:06,283
with a different sub-behavior   
of our asteroid behavior.       

716
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:08,953
The first one of them           
flying all over.                

717
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:12,789
For now I'm gonna put a little  
boundary around my entire       

718
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:14,724
view, my reference view here,   
so                              

719
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,193
the asteroids hit that          
boundary and bounce back.       

720
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:18,193
So they're all kept in here.    

721
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,829
Now that's not gonna work for   
my game, as you'll see,         

722
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,964
because as you're flying        
through space the asteroids     

723
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,266
don't bounce back out of        
some invisible wall and         

724
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,067
come at you.                    

725
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,768
They are, the new ones          
are always coming.              

726
00:31:27,837 --> 00:31:29,336
And I will talk about           
how we're gonna do              

727
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:30,303
that trick in a minute.         

728
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:31,837
But first I just                
want you to see how             

729
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:32,671
collision behavior works.       

730
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,306
So, I'm gonna add a boundary,   

731
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:38,610
which is all the way around     
this reference view, okay?      

732
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:39,611
So how are we gonna do that?    

733
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,880
So, let's go back to            
our behavior, okay?             

734
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,716
To do a collision boundary      
like that we're just going to   

735
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:47,351
create a private VAR            
which is going to be a.         

736
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,352
And it's going to be            

737
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:56,993
a UICollisionBehavior Now       
any time we add                 

738
00:31:57,062 --> 00:32:01,030
a new behavior, we need to do   
this add ChildBehavior thing.   

739
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:04,466
And a good place to do that,    
actually, is in init.           

740
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,536
So I'm going to override init,  
here.                           

741
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:08,870
Call my super init.             

742
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:14,175
And then, I'm going to add      
this ChildBehavior collider.    

743
00:32:14,244 --> 00:32:16,544
And that again means as soon    
as I get added to an animator,  

744
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,279
the collider gets               
added to an animator.           

745
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:19,646
It will animate as well.        

746
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:23,783
The other thing we need to do   
is add all of our asteroids to  

747
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,018
this behavior.                  

748
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,719
Just because we                 
added ChildHehavior,            

749
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,787
it doesn't mean it applies      
to all of our items.            

750
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,155
We might not want that.         

751
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:32,157
We might not want               
the collision effect.           

752
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:34,592
Later, we're gonna find we      
don't want our collider         

753
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,195
actually to apply to            
the asteroids for example.      

754
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:40,965
Or to we don't want our         
collisions to happen with       

755
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,065
the ship.                       

756
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,400
Okay, that's how                
we wanna do it.                 

757
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,335
So, how do we do this?          

758
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:48,071
We do this by going down here   
where we add a new asteroid.    

759
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:49,404
Every time we add               
a new asteroid,                 

760
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:50,973
we're gonna say collider.       

761
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:53,208
addItem[asteroid).              

762
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:54,743
And same thing down here        
when we're gonna remove.        

763
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:58,480
We're gonna say                 
collider.removeItem[asteroid).  

764
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,549
Okay, so                        
don't forget those two steps.   

765
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:06,954
In fact, I, let me move this    
code up here next to the init   

766
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:08,187
so you can see.                 

767
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,290
They kind of go together.       

768
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,357
These two,                      
these three things right here.  

769
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,359
Adding a ChildBehavior and      
then adding the item.           

770
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,161
We're gonna do that over and    
over for                        

771
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,097
all of our sub-behaviors        
that we're gonna create.        

772
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,766
Okay, now we have this          
collider but we have to         

773
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,969
configure the collider to say   
what do we collide against.     

774
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,570
And remember I want             
the outer bounds.               

775
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,705
I want the asteroids to         
collide with the outer bounds.  

776
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,174
For fun, I'm also gonna make    
the asteroids collide with      

777
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,744
each other, okay,               
to start here.                  

778
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,312
So let's see what               
that look like.                 

779
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,645
I'm gonna do this               
same trick here.                

780
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:39,881
Private, private lazy var.      

781
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:43,118
And I'm actually going to       
initialize this collider using  

782
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,451
a closure.                      

783
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,721
So to CollisionBehavior.        

784
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:48,555
And it's gonna =,               

785
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:55,127
whoops = a closure that I'm     
going to execute, okay.         

786
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:58,731
And inside of this closure,     
I'm gonna do this so            

787
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,300
I'm gonna let behavior = that.  

788
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:06,438
And I'm gonna return            
that behavior, okay.            

789
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,939
So this is a way you can        
initialize a var and            

790
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:12,009
do some initialization          
stuff here right in line.       

791
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:15,045
Okay, so what do I want my      
CollisionBehavior to do?        

792
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:20,883
So I want it to have            
a certain mode of collision,    

793
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,252
so let's talk about that.       

794
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,421
CollisionMode is                
a var in behavior.              

795
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,690
And there's three different     
ways you can set this,          

796
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:31,260
one is collides                 
with everything.                

797
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:33,562
So everything means everything  
collides with everything.       

798
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,896
Boundaries, items               
like asteroids,                 

799
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:37,398
they're all colliding           
with each other.                

800
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,332
That's what we're gonna do.     

801
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,734
But the other options would     
have been boundaries,           

802
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:42,736
which means it only             
collides with boundaries.       

803
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:44,504
And we're gonna talk about      
how to add boundaries,          

804
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:46,706
bezier paths as boundaries.     

805
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:50,309
Or you can have only the items  
colliding with each other       

806
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:51,910
like just the asteroids         
colliding with each other, but  

807
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:53,511
they don't collide              
with any boundaries.            

808
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,381
Well, here, I'm gonna have it   
collide both with boundaries    

809
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,517
and with the each other.        

810
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,117
with the boundary.              

811
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:01,451
Now, how about that boundary?   

812
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,720
I want a boundary that's        
all the way around              

813
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:04,787
my reference view.              

814
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:06,922
It turns out there's            
a var to just do that           

815
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:08,090
automatically called            

816
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,459
translateReferenceBoundIntoBo-  
undary.                         

817
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:13,094
If you set that to true,        
it'll add a boundary.           

818
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:15,163
Which is a rectangle around     
your reference view.            

819
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:18,032
Now we're later going to show   
how we can put boundaries in    

820
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,600
by specifying paths.            

821
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:22,569
Like the ship, the shields      
of the ship is a path.          

822
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:25,839
But for now we'll just          
do this simple one here.        

823
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,640
Now, I don't have to do         
anything anywhere else in       

824
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,474
my code.                        

825
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,143
I can, since I've set up        
this asteroid behavior          

826
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,345
I can just keep adding          
behaviors to it and             

827
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:34,846
it'll just apply                
to the asteroids.               

828
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:37,115
I don't have to go back to my   
controller and do anything.     

829
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:39,717
Okay, my controller already     
has created an animator and     

830
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,518
added this behavior.            

831
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:42,986
So there's nothing more to do.  

832
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,788
So let's go see what            
this looks like.                

833
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:47,824
Now our asteroids that we know  
won't fly off into oblivion,    

834
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:48,758
at least.                       

835
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:53,428
Okay, there they are.           

836
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,964
And you can see they're         
bouncing off each other, and    

837
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:58,132
they're hitting the walls, and  

838
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:00,034
they're also slowing way,       
way down.                       

839
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:04,104
Okay, that's that bad friction  
thing going on there.           

840
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:05,672
All right, so how are we        
gonna fix the friction?         

841
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:08,942
We want these things to just    
kinda keep bouncing around and  

842
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:09,709
not stop like this.             

843
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:12,411
We want them to feel like       
they're in outer space.         

844
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,347
Well, to do friction we         
actually need a different kind  

845
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,317
of behavior which is called     
the dynamic item behavior.      

846
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:21,620
And a dynamic item behavior,    
talked about it in the slides,  

847
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,188
is kinda of a meta behavior.    

848
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:26,390
It's gonna describe the         
physics of how these things     

849
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:30,594
work when other behaviors act   
on them, like colliders, okay?  

850
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,663
So when the collider hits,      
we're gonna be                  

851
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,899
able to describe how bouncy     
the hit is, for example.        

852
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,534
And we get to say whether       
there's friction, and           

853
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,402
whether they slow down,         
and things like that.           

854
00:36:39,471 --> 00:36:43,038
So let's create one of those,   
private lazy var.               

855
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:46,041
I'm gonna call mine physics,    
because that's what it kind of  

856
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:49,444
feels like, you're specifying   
the physics of your             

857
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:50,846
all your asteroid reviews.      

858
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:55,883
And it's a UIDynamicItem        
behavior.                       

859
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,485
Don't get confused              
here between dynamic            

860
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,954
item behavior and               
dynamic behavior.               

861
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,390
Okay, dynamic behavior          
is the root of all,             

862
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:06,326
it's the su, super              
colossal of all behaviors.      

863
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:07,927
This is a specific              
kind of behavior.               

864
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:10,429
Just like a collision           
behavior is a behavior, so      

865
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:12,230
is a dynamic item behavior,     
okay.                           

866
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,633
The people confuse those        
two cuz they're so              

867
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,600
similar in name.                

868
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:20,671
But I'm going to do the same    
thing here, let behavior        

869
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,542
= a UIDynamicItemBehavior       
Behavior.                       

870
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,879
And I'm gonna return that       
behavior out of this closure.   

871
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:30,214
Everyone understand, right?     

872
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,749
I got a closure here,           
I'm returning this behavior     

873
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,385
out of that enclo, clo, that    
closure, which I'm executing.   

874
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,419
And then to assigning           
it to this.                     

875
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,521
And just doing it lazy.         

876
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,656
All right, so                   
what kind of things can we set  

877
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:44,225
in this physics like,           
in this meta behavior?          

878
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:47,494
Well, what are things           
we want here?                   

879
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:51,465
Let's try the elasticity        
have about.                     

880
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:56,302
So elasticity says how when     
two things collide for          

881
00:37:56,371 --> 00:38:00,040
example, how much               
energy does it lose.            

882
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:03,309
If you have an elasticity       
of one, that means              

883
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:06,312
they don't lose any energy,     
at least no linear energy.      

884
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:10,015
They, if they spin, then they   
might lose linear energy and    

885
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:12,685
gain angular velocity, but      

886
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:15,153
elasticity means that           
they're bouncy, right?          

887
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:18,322
Now an elasticity of two        
would mean they gain energy.    

888
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:19,056
So they bounce off.             

889
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,591
Now they're going               
faster coming out.              

890
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:23,159
And a 0.5 would mean            
they'd be slowing down.         

891
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:26,563
So one, since we are gonna      
allow our asteroids to spin,    

892
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,466
our asteroids will kinda        
generally slow down.            

893
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:32,068
But over a much longer time     
than they were before.          

894
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,769
Cuz our elasticity before was,  
I'm gonna,                      

895
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,871
I don't know what the default   
is but it's very low.           

896
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,773
Speaking of spinning,           
let's make it so                

897
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,674
that our asteroids can spin.    

898
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:43,010
And we can just do              
that here by saying             

899
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:44,745
it allowsRotationTrue.          

900
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:48,415
So that says when there's a     
collision, the views can spin,  

901
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:50,650
okay, just like                 
an asteroid would.              

902
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,418
Of course we want that.         

903
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:53,553
How about friction?             

904
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,522
Let's set our friction to 0,    
okay?                           

905
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:59,958
No friction.                    

906
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:02,159
across the tabletop,            
they're in outer space.         

907
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:05,229
And there's also a similar      
one here called resistance,     

908
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:07,364
which I'm also                  
gonna set to zero.              

909
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:10,033
Resistance is how               
much items resist               

910
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:12,035
the forces being                
applied to them.                

911
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:13,737
So if you set a very            
high resistance,                

912
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,038
then they'll resist it a lot.   

913
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,205
Now, why do you                 
want resistance?                

914
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,674
Well, you might have a gravity  
field or something like that,   

915
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,177
where some things are getting   
pulled fully by gravity but     

916
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:23,278
other things are not.           

917
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:25,179
Like they're a balloon or       
something, I don't know.        

918
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:26,847
They, they float more or        
whatever.                       

919
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,848
So you'll be able to            
control their resistance.       

920
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,984
You can put them in             
the same behavior,              

921
00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:33,886
like same gravity behavior,     
same collision behavior.        

922
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,924
But you can control how much    
they resist, those things.      

923
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,925
All right, so                   
we don't want any resistance,   

924
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:42,161
we want when they collide,      
full impact.                    

925
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:44,963
So this physics behavior,       
just like the collider,         

926
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:49,500
has to be added as a child,     
and it has to be, and           

927
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,235
the items all have              
to be added to it.              

928
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:56,173
So physics And                  
we need to addItem here.        

929
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,810
Physic, oops, asteroids,        
sorry, asteroid.                

930
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,945
This is physics over here.      

931
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:05,481
Physics, and same thing here.   

932
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,284
Eh, physics.                    

933
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:11,452
You'll often forget to do       
this stuff, right here.         

934
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:15,256
You'll add nice behavior like,  
you forgot to do this.          

935
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:16,056
And you want to apply,          

936
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,758
of course, because              
until you add the items         

937
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:19,760
unless it's a child             
behavior and                    

938
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:21,928
then that behavior              
won't affect anything.          

939
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:23,930
All right.                      
So, let's see what this does,   

940
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:26,499
see if this pictures            
are problem by adding this      

941
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:27,299
behavior.                       

942
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,167
Okay, yeah.                     

943
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:33,371
See, they're not slowing down,  
I mean, they are actually, but  

944
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,173
they're slowing down so slowly  
you can't really tell and       

945
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:37,441
they're all bouncing            
at each other, and              

946
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:40,544
spinning and some of them       
are going quite fast actually.  

947
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,145
Got it?                         

948
00:40:43,214 --> 00:40:46,315
Okay, now this would not        
be a good asteroid game,        

949
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,950
because you, the ship would     
be getting crushed in the,      

950
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:49,951
this asteroid field.            

951
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,385
But we're going to put          
our ship in here anyway.        

952
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:53,254
We're going to put our          
ship right in the middle.       

953
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:55,056
So, I can show you              
how the shield work.            

954
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,425
And our ship is supposed        
to get battered here.           

955
00:40:58,494 --> 00:40:59,326
So, let's add our ship.         

956
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:02,128
So, I'm going to go             
back to our controller.         

957
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:04,697
Here in same place where I      
initialize my asteroidfield     

958
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,498
and create my                   
asteroidfield right there.      

959
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,467
I'm gonna create my             
ship here as well.              

960
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:11,536
How big is my ship              
gonna be web?                   

961
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:15,005
I want my ship to kinda be a    
good size relative to the size  

962
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:18,075
of my view bound,               
right, myself.view.             

963
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,310
So, I set a constant for that,  
which I think one fifth.        

964
00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:24,747
So, I gonna make my ship be     
one fifth of the shorter side   

965
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,166
Whichever side is shorter,      
I'll make my ship one fifth     

966
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,517
of my balance.                  

967
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,719
the size, so I'll say           
let ship size equal my          

968
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:35,557
view.bounds.size.minEdge Just   
another one of the things I     

969
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:40,528
added in my, core graphics      
thing, so I'll take whatever    

970
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,064
the minEdge is and I'm gonna    
multiply it by a constant,      

971
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:47,435
which is the                    
shipSizeToMinBoundsEdgeRatio.   

972
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,204
And let's go take a look and    
then what I set to,             

973
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:52,739
here is my constant,            
I set it yeah, to one fifth.    

974
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:53,540
So, to one fifth.               

975
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,775
So, the ship is one fifth       
the size of the minimum age.    

976
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:58,244
Which seems like                
that's pretty good.             

977
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:01,246
You know balanced size,         
my ship might be a little       

978
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:03,549
too big and I pass, so I might  
wanna play with that but yeah,  

979
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:06,218
we'll see So                    
I now got the ship size.        

980
00:42:06,286 --> 00:42:07,452
Now I just need to              
create the ship.                

981
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,787
And it's just a view.           

982
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:10,554
So, let's go up here and        
create a var for it,            

983
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:12,222
just like we have for           
our asteroid field.             

984
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,656
Let's do var ship.              

985
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:15,558
We'll call it                   
a spaceship view.               

986
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:18,094
And we'll also make             
that be implicitly              

987
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:18,861
unwrapped and optional,         

988
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,329
because we're gonna initialize  
it right here at the start.     

989
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:24,466
And so we'll say our ship       

990
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:29,137
equals [SOUND]                  
spaceship view Frame.           

991
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:30,972
We'll do a CGrect here.         

992
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:34,542
Let's have our                  
ship be centered                

993
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,443
on the asteroid field.          

994
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,746
We're going to put it           
in the asteroid fields.         

995
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:41,948
Center.                         

996
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,449
Of course, we know the size.    

997
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,451
Is the shipSize.                

998
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,019
And actually,                   
I want it to be a square, so    

999
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:50,121
I'm gonna use a different       
CGRect thing that I have,       

1000
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,658
which is squareCenteredAt,      
I think I called it.            

1001
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,961
If I typed that right,          
yeah, squareCenteredAt.         

1002
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,597
So ship is gonna be a square,   
centered at the asteroid        

1003
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,331
field's center, right in the    
middle of the asteroid field.   

1004
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,066
And it's gonna be               
the shipSize that we            

1005
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:05,368
calculated right there.         

1006
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:08,970
So, let's add This              
ship to our subviews.           

1007
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,441
Now notice that I've added      
the ship to my self.view as     

1008
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:15,110
a subview, so it's a sibling    
of my asteroid field,           

1009
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,144
it's not a subview of           
my asteroid field.              

1010
00:43:17,213 --> 00:43:18,045
My asteroid field really,       

1011
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:20,280
the only subviews it has        
is all those asteroids.         

1012
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:25,952
But I decided I'm gonna put my  
ship at the same level there.   

1013
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,554
And what's it                   
complaining about here.         

1014
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:34,059
Sorry, see here at sorry,       
yes, view.addSubview.           

1015
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:35,561
We've gotta add it              
to our self.view.               

1016
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:39,664
We're in our controller         
right now, not view, okay?      

1017
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:40,965
So there's our ship.            

1018
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:43,201
Let's go take a look at our     
ship actually right now.        

1019
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,836
There's no collision's          
gonna happen.                   

1020
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:48,071
Our ship is not involved        
in the asteroid behavior.       

1021
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,372
right?                          
We haven't added our ship       

1022
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:51,274
to the asteroid                 
behavior in any way.            

1023
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:53,409
So there's our ship,            
it's pointing at zero,          

1024
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:56,745
which is off to the right, and  
the asteroids are just flying.  

1025
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:59,247
They're behind it, because the  
ship was added to the sub-view  

1026
00:43:59,316 --> 00:44:00,883
later, so it's in front.        

1027
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,550
Right, we know that our         
subviews are in order from      

1028
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:03,918
back to front.                  

1029
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:04,652
Okay.                           

1030
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:07,988
So, now we want these           
asteroids to collide            

1031
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:09,289
with our ship's shield.         

1032
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,058
The ship's shield is just a     
round circle around our ship,   

1033
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,592
and we want it to               
collide there.                  

1034
00:44:13,661 --> 00:44:16,896
So, we're going to have to add  
more to our collision behavior  

1035
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:19,598
code over here in behavior.     

1036
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,367
Because right now, all we're    
doing is having everything      

1037
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:23,935
collide with everything, and    

1038
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:26,570
the reference bound is          
our only bound here.            

1039
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,940
So, I'm going to do this        
by adding another Func,         

1040
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:33,243
just give me a public func      
called setBoundary and          

1041
00:44:33,312 --> 00:44:37,714
it's gonna let you set          
a UIBezierPath, [COUGH] as      

1042
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:41,484
a boundary and it's gonna       
be able to have a name so       

1043
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,952
we can refer to it later.       

1044
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,687
You will see why we need        
to be able to do that and       

1045
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:49,125
then another cool thing,        
how about if we add a handler.  

1046
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:51,493
So that if there's a collision  
with that boundary,             

1047
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:53,628
we call our handler for you.    

1048
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:55,629
Wouldn't that be cool to        
use closures in that way?       

1049
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:57,264
So let's do that handler.       

1050
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,732
What's the type of              
handler gonna be?               

1051
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:01,968
Well, it's just gonna be        
takes a void, returns void,     

1052
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:04,170
in other words doesn't have     
any arguments or whatever.      

1053
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,739
And I'm actually gonna          
make it optional as well.       

1054
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:07,940
Som you don't have              
to do a handler.                

1055
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,141
You can put a boundary, and     

1056
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,442
the collisions will             
happen with it.                 

1057
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:11,476
But if you don't                
put a handler,                  

1058
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,811
then no one ever                
finds out about it.             

1059
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,446
Right.                          

1060
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:18,282
I have too many parentheses     
in here maybe, that one?        

1061
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,051
Yeah, all right?                

1062
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,719
So, we got that.                
So,                             

1063
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:25,321
how are we gonna implement      
this setBoundary?               

1064
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,690
Well, first we've got to add    
this boundary to the collider.  

1065
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,159
Right, we've got this           
collider behavior up here.      

1066
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,563
We need to add this new         
boundary, this BezierPath as    

1067
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,464
an area that is going           
to collide again, and           

1068
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,266
that, against,                  
and that's easy.                

1069
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:41,835
Collider.addBoundary.           

1070
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:43,604
The boundaries, when you add    
them, need an identifier.       

1071
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:45,305
Okay?                           

1072
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:46,739
Okay?                           
Which makes sense because when  

1073
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:47,740
the collide,                    
collision happens,              

1074
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:49,575
you gotta say which             
boundary you collided with.     

1075
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:50,909
So, we'll use name for that.    

1076
00:45:50,978 --> 00:45:54,278
But remember this has           
to be an NScopying.             

1077
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:57,715
So, we gonna say as             
in a string here,               

1078
00:45:57,784 --> 00:46:00,284
cuz in a string minus           
number are both                 

1079
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:02,886
an escaping that we             
can use right here.             

1080
00:46:02,955 --> 00:46:05,822
And that works because          
string can always be as         

1081
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,190
a string and back.              

1082
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,425
Okay it's special               
the relationship between        

1083
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:11,193
those two case.                 

1084
00:46:11,262 --> 00:46:14,463
And okay we are gonna           
add the path here.              

1085
00:46:14,532 --> 00:46:15,097
Okay?                           

1086
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,066
Now, the only                   
thing about this,               

1087
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,502
though, what if someone         
sets the Boundary again?        

1088
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,705
Then we pretty much want        
to remove the old one, so       

1089
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:29,276
I'm also gonna say              
collider.removeBoundary,        

1090
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:33,613
the name as NSString to         
get it out of there.            

1091
00:46:33,681 --> 00:46:34,481
Not removeItem.                 

1092
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:39,184
Remove boundary                 
with identifier.                

1093
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:42,921
Name as NNString.               

1094
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:43,689
Got that?                       

1095
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:47,024
Okay, so, I'm going to          
remove the boundary, and        

1096
00:46:47,093 --> 00:46:48,525
I'm only going to               
add the boundary,               

1097
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:50,661
actually, if you                
specify a path.                 

1098
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:53,530
So, I'm going to make           
this path be optional.          

1099
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,532
And then we'll                  
unwrap it there.                

1100
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,969
I'm only gonna say if           
the path does not equal nil,    

1101
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:01,103
then add the boundary back.     

1102
00:47:01,172 --> 00:47:02,838
That way if you say,            
set the boundary nil,           

1103
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,907
it will get of                  
the boundary of that name.      

1104
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:08,142
So it's a way of kind of        
having one method to add and    

1105
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:09,510
remove boundaries.              

1106
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,879
Now what about this handler?    

1107
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:14,714
We've gotta somehow hold onto   
this handler so that when       

1108
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:17,950
a collision happens later,      
we can call this handler.       

1109
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,619
So whoever created this         
boundary can find out           

1110
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:21,954
you had a collision there.      

1111
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:25,023
So, I'm going to create         
a little private var here       

1112
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,626
called collision handlers and   
it's going to be a dictionary.  

1113
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:32,263
And that dictionary's keys are  
going to be strings and what    

1114
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,633
do you think the var or the     
value of this is going to be?   

1115
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:41,805
How about a function?           

1116
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:47,143
Okay, so I'm just creating      
a dictionary whose keys         

1117
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,810
are going to be                 
the names here, and             

1118
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:52,080
whose values are gonna          
be the handlers.                

1119
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,817
Okay, and I know it taken you   
guys a lot, some of you a lot   

1120
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:58,353
to un, really get comfortable   
with this idea that functions   

1121
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,254
are just types.                 

1122
00:47:59,322 --> 00:48:03,091
It's no different then          
a string right there, okay?     

1123
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:05,592
And so we can have              
a dictionary full of them.      

1124
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:09,029
It's very, very nice and        
easy to use.                    

1125
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:11,931
So we wanna do the same thing   
here to remove the old one.     

1126
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,900
So I'm gonna say my             
collisionHandlers of this       

1127
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:16,068
[name] = nil.                   

1128
00:48:16,137 --> 00:48:18,771
So I'm removing any             
old handler for this.           

1129
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,540
And when I add it in here,      
there's a new path,             

1130
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,609
I'm just gonna say              
collisionHandlers[name] =       

1131
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:25,610
the handler.                    

1132
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,046
Okay, so now I'm keeping        
track of those handlers for     

1133
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,581
each of these                   
named boundaries.               

1134
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,383
Right, these boundaries         
have names, and                 

1135
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:34,483
I'm keeping track               
of the handler.                 

1136
00:48:34,552 --> 00:48:38,487
So how do I call this handler   
when a collision occurs?        

1137
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:40,156
Well, we need to find           
out about collision.            

1138
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:43,424
So here's how we find           
out about collisions.           

1139
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:44,759
We do it with a delegate.       

1140
00:48:44,828 --> 00:48:47,561
You see, it's the delegant      
of our collision behavior.      

1141
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,164
So we're gonna go up            
here to our behavior,           

1142
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:54,034
collision behavior, and say     
that it's collisionDelegate.    

1143
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:54,968
It's not called delegate.       

1144
00:48:55,037 --> 00:48:56,869
It's called collisionDelegate.  

1145
00:48:56,938 --> 00:48:59,205
Equals, and                     
I'm gonna have it be self.      

1146
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:01,808
So this asteroid behavior       
itself is going to get          

1147
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:04,142
the notification that           
a collision occurred.           

1148
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,010
So that means I have to be      

1149
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,447
a UICollisionBehaviorDelegate   
to do that.                     

1150
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,782
All the methods in              
there are optional.             

1151
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:14,252
So I successfully               
implemented that delegate.      

1152
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,221
But, of course, I want to       
implement one of the methods.   

1153
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,655
And so                          
let's look at some of them.     

1154
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:20,290
So I'm just typing              
collision here so               

1155
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:21,324
I can see what they are.        

1156
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,392
You can see there's             
four of them.                   

1157
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,828
There's begin and end contact,  
you see, begin and              

1158
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,464
end contact for                 
boundaries or items.            

1159
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,299
So I can find out if            
the items are colliding or      

1160
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,667
I can find out if items are     
colliding with the boundary.    

1161
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:36,737
And of course I want            
the boundary collisions, and    

1162
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:39,106
I pretty much want the began.   

1163
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:44,010
So when the contact starts,     
okay, impact first happens,     

1164
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,145
I wanna find out                
about it then.                  

1165
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:48,548
So I'm gonna pick this one      
beganContactFor item with       

1166
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:49,281
boundary.                       

1167
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:52,818
Let's look at the arguments     
here more clearly so            

1168
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:54,219
you can see them.               

1169
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,962
All right, so this is the       
collision delegate method that  

1170
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:08,232
gets sent when a item,          
an AsteroidView,                

1171
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:10,501
impacts a boundary.             

1172
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,968
Like the ship's boundary, or    

1173
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:14,337
even the reference              
bound's boundary.               

1174
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:17,373
And it even tells you at what   
point in the reference view     

1175
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:20,209
the two things touched, okay?   

1176
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:21,694
Now, we could even have had     
our handler take that CGPoint   

1177
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:23,111
Which is kinda nice.            

1178
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:23,611
as an argument.                 

1179
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,645
We could've told                
the person that,                

1180
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:27,481
but, eh, we kinda have          
a dumb handler here.            

1181
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:30,417
It could be better, but we'll   
leave it with what it is.       

1182
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,885
All right, so                   
what do wanna do here?          

1183
00:50:31,953 --> 00:50:34,087
Here we wanna see               
if first of all,                

1184
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,522
I wanna get the name            
from that identifier.           

1185
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,059
So if I can let the name equal  
that boundary identifier,       

1186
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:41,794
this thing right here.          

1187
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:44,763
And it's an NSCopying,          
and it's also optional.         

1188
00:50:44,832 --> 00:50:47,065
So I'm gonna say, as String.    

1189
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:49,234
So if I can get that            
identifier as a string,         

1190
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:51,769
which it needs to be if I,      
if it's a handler here.         

1191
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:53,937
The, there might be other       
identifiers in there for        

1192
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:55,439
other boundaries                
that you create.                

1193
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:58,308
But it's gotta be a string      
if we're gonna do this.         

1194
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:02,678
And then also I'm gonna         
let the handler equal our       

1195
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:06,849
collisionHandlers, sub          
that name, okay?                

1196
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,150
So if I can do                  
those two things,               

1197
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:12,821
I can get the handler for       
that collision.                 

1198
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,488
And what am I gonna do here?    

1199
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:15,323
Call the handler.               

1200
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,160
All right, this is              
a little bit sophisticated      

1201
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:22,528
implementation here.            

1202
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:24,930
I'm using closures and          
all that stuff.                 

1203
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,034
Hopefully you,                  
you're understanding it.        

1204
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:32,838
If you're not, you know, make   
sure you follow up with Piazza  

1205
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,174
or with the TAs in office       
hours or whatever.              

1206
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:38,543
But this is the kind of thing,  
this is the kind of coding you  

1207
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,044
want to be able to              
do in Swift, okay?              

1208
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:43,947
Using closures to cause         
things like this to happen.     

1209
00:51:44,016 --> 00:51:46,584
So this is the public           
method right here that we       

1210
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:48,318
are going to use                
in our controller.              

1211
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:51,654
We need to set a boundary,      
which is the ship's shield.     

1212
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:54,724
And in the handler we're        
gonna do whatever we do when    

1213
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:56,458
an asteroid gets our shape.     

1214
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:57,326
So let's go to that.            

1215
00:51:57,395 --> 00:51:58,961
Let's go back to our            
controller here.                

1216
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,062
Now, where do we wanna          
set that boundary?              

1217
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:02,664
Now this is kind                
of interesting.                 

1218
00:52:02,732 --> 00:52:04,331
You would think we              
might wanna set                 

1219
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,366
it here in initializeIfNeeded.  

1220
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:08,201
But it turns out we             
can't do that, or               

1221
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,870
at least not only there.        

1222
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:10,836
And why is that?                

1223
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:13,139
That's because this             
boundary we're ta,              

1224
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,272
setting it in the behavior,     

1225
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,775
it has to be in the reference   
view coordinate system.         

1226
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,944
And that boundary is            
going to change position        

1227
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:23,280
when we rotate our device,      
okay?                           

1228
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,582
You know that when you          
rotate your device,             

1229
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,549
your bounds change and          

1230
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:27,884
the center is in                
a different place.              

1231
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:29,819
Okay, coordinates of            
it are different.               

1232
00:52:29,887 --> 00:52:31,120
So that's why we can,           

1233
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,423
we need to reposition our ship  
every time our bounds change.   

1234
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:36,525
So we'll do in                  
initializeIfNeeded.             

1235
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,226
But we're also gonna            
have to do it in                

1236
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:40,595
viewDidLayoutSubviews, okay?    

1237
00:52:40,664 --> 00:52:42,597
So let's create a private       
func to do that.                

1238
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,799
We'll call it repositionShip,   
okay?                           

1239
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:47,534
This is every time              
the ship changes position.      

1240
00:52:47,603 --> 00:52:50,336
And we can only do this if      
we have an asteroid field,      

1241
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:52,605
because we put the ship in the  
middle of the asteroid field.   

1242
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:53,706
So if we have no                
asteroid field,                 

1243
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,475
we have no idea                 
where to put it.                

1244
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:58,610
So if the asteroid field        
does not equal nil,             

1245
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,211
then we can                     
reposition the ship.            

1246
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,648
And we know that                
the ship itself,                

1247
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:08,453
its center is                   
the asteroidField's center.     

1248
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:14,258
We don't even need that, it's   
implicitly unwrapped, right?    

1249
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:17,060
So the asteroidField.center,    
right?                          

1250
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:18,962
So that's positioning           
the ship, but                   

1251
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,365
now we need to add this         
boundary around the ship.       

1252
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:25,100
So we're gonna tell             
our asteroidBehavior            

1253
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,768
to set a boundary.              

1254
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:29,037
Now, the boundary is            
the boundary of the shield.     

1255
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:31,773
And I told you ship has         
this nice method called         

1256
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,241
shieldBoundary, okay?           

1257
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,776
And shieldBoundary even takes   

1258
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,278
the coordinate                  
system you want.                

1259
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:39,179
So we want this to be           
in our reference view,          

1260
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:40,981
which is the asteroidField.     

1261
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:43,983
So that's gonna give us back    
a Bezier path that describes    

1262
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:46,552
the shield in                   
the asteroidField coordinate    

1263
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:47,286
system.                         

1264
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:48,953
We can call this                
whatever we want.               

1265
00:53:49,022 --> 00:53:50,121
I have a constant for it.       

1266
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,625
I'm gonna call it               
shipBoundaryName.               

1267
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:58,228
Oops, not shipSize, do they,    
no, shipBoundaryName.           

1268
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,530
So that's                       
the shipBoundaryName.           

1269
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,099
And we'll use the trailing      
closure syntax here.            

1270
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:04,201
Let's put this on here.         

1271
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:07,404
So let's go back here, and      
you all know about that.        

1272
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:14,043
And it has no argument, so      
we really don't need that.      

1273
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:17,279
Although I do wanna do          
weak self here, okay?           

1274
00:54:17,347 --> 00:54:20,749
Because this is probably not    
going to be a problem where     

1275
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:24,352
somehow this animator           
gets all rogue and              

1276
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,821
[LAUGH] starts animating with   
my controller being gone.       

1277
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,957
But probably I don't            
need weak self here,            

1278
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,059
almost certainly I don't.       

1279
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:34,761
I can almost certainly          
do unowned self here.           

1280
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,198
But I'm gonna go ahead and      
do it anyway just for fun.      

1281
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,666
And so we have weak self here.  

1282
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:44,736
We, we,                         
this is setting the boundary.   

1283
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:47,639
This our handler that           
happens when it collides.       

1284
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:50,342
So what are we gonna do         
when an asteroid hits us?       

1285
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,877
Well, I'm gonna have            
auto shield activation.         

1286
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:58,982
So I'm going to say,            
ship.shieldIsActive = true.     

1287
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:01,050
If we have a collision,         
bam, I'm gonna do it.           

1288
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,987
However, I'm only gonna         
activate that shield for        

1289
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:05,955
one second, okay?               

1290
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:08,524
So if you have                  
an asteroid hit you, yeah,      

1291
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:09,725
I'll put your shield up.        

1292
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:13,362
But it's going back down and    
if another one hits you,        

1293
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:14,429
it's gonna go back up again.    

1294
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:16,964
So how am I gonna make          
this shield go back to be       

1295
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:18,165
inactive in one second?         

1296
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:19,733
Well, I'm gonna use a timer.    

1297
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:21,869
Okay, scheduled, and            
I have a constant for it.       

1298
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:24,971
It's called my                  
Shield.duration, and            

1299
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,973
it does not repeat.             

1300
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:28,607
And it does this block,         

1301
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:31,844
which is just going to          
turn that thing back off.       

1302
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:35,981
We'll use trailing closure      
syntax for this one too.        

1303
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:42,219
And so we're just going         
to ship.shieldIsAc,             

1304
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:45,623
oops, IsActive = false, okay?   

1305
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:47,991
So here I'm just turning        
this shield on and back off.    

1306
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,093
Now, of course, ship right      
here is not defined.            

1307
00:55:50,162 --> 00:55:51,595
It needs to be self.ship, so    

1308
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:55,798
I'm gonna say If I can let      
ship equal self?.ship, because  

1309
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,901
ship itself is weak right       
there, then I will do this.     

1310
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:05,974
Now, if I didn't                
charge any fee for              

1311
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,210
activating your                 
ship's shields,                 

1312
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,244
then the shields would just     
constantly come on and          

1313
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:11,578
this wouldn't be                
much of a game.                 

1314
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:14,882
Okay, so                        
I'm going to charge you some,   

1315
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,083
some power of your              
shield to do it.                

1316
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:22,455
So, I'm gonna say ship dot      
ship level, minus equals,       

1317
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:23,422
and I have a constant for       
that,                           

1318
00:56:23,491 --> 00:56:28,127
too, which is shield            
activation cost, okay.          

1319
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,861
So, I'm going to                
deplete your shield             

1320
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,063
every time I turn it on.        

1321
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:33,864
Everybody got this code?        

1322
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,033
This is super simple,           
obviously if we had a real      

1323
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:39,469
game, we'd probably have        
shield regeneration and         

1324
00:56:39,538 --> 00:56:41,472
maybe the user would have to    
turn their shield on when       

1325
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,439
they realize they               
are about to crash into or      

1326
00:56:43,508 --> 00:56:47,143
whatever but I'm just trying    
to make this pretty simple and  

1327
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:48,111
straight forward here.          

1328
00:56:50,214 --> 00:56:52,881
Okay the other thing            
I'm gonna do is                 

1329
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,349
I'm gonna have                  
auto resurrection.              

1330
00:56:55,418 --> 00:56:57,051
So, if your ship                
gets destroyed,                 

1331
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,219
I'm gonna bring                 
you right back.                 

1332
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:01,922
Okay, again cuz it's better     
for our purposes here.          

1333
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,724
So, I'm just gonna say when     
this shield gets turned back    

1334
00:57:04,793 --> 00:57:09,463
off, if the ship's shield       
level has dropped down          

1335
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:11,463
to zero, in other words         
it's been destroyed.            

1336
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:14,900
Then, I'm gonna set the ship's  
field level back to 100.        

1337
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:18,471
Okay, full shields, boom,       
it comes back to life.          

1338
00:57:19,673 --> 00:57:22,440
Now this reposition ship        

1339
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:25,710
obviously needs to happen here  
in viewDidLayoutSubviews.       

1340
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:30,047
And I'm also gonna position     
the ship right after I create   

1341
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:33,850
my ship up here, so             
that the boundary gets          

1342
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:36,652
created right at the beginning  
when it first initialized.      

1343
00:57:36,721 --> 00:57:41,357
Now one thing about adding      
this ship, is, well, we'll,     

1344
00:57:41,426 --> 00:57:42,357
we'll see if it happens.        

1345
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:43,959
If it doesn't happen I'll come  
back and do it, but there's a   

1346
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,994
little bit of a problem adding  
this ship with this shield.     

1347
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,229
This might see, hopefully,      
cross your fingers,             

1348
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,464
we'll see the problem here.     

1349
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,232
Now we didn't see it, but, so   

1350
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:54,500
our ship got destroyed          
really quick here.              

1351
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:57,370
Why did our ship get            
destroyed so fast?              

1352
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:59,372
Shouldn't get destroyed so      
fast.                           

1353
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,773
Hold on a second here.          

1354
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:07,079
Okay, if our shield is          
up from a previous hit,         

1355
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:08,914
we won't let ourselves          
be damaged again.               

1356
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:13,485
So here I'm gonna say If the    
ship's shield is not active.    

1357
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:18,555
Okay, if the shield is          
not currently active.           

1358
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:19,756
Then I'll do all this stuff.    

1359
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:21,691
But if the shield is            
currently active.               

1360
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,426
Then I'll just ignore the hit.  

1361
00:58:23,495 --> 00:58:24,260
Okay.                           

1362
00:58:24,328 --> 00:58:26,362
So when we turn that            
shield on for a second,         

1363
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:30,432
we get a second's worth of      
survival [LAUGH] in our ship.   

1364
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:37,372
Okay, so now we see, see how    
when this shield comes on,      

1365
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,507
it kind of is thicker, is       
bolder and then goes thinner?   

1366
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,509
And you can see it going        
smaller and smaller and         

1367
00:58:42,578 --> 00:58:43,710
then the ship explodes, right?  

1368
00:58:43,778 --> 00:58:46,346
And then,                       
we auto resurrect, okay?        

1369
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:48,047
So again, this would not        
be a very good game [LAUGH]     

1370
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:50,817
because we've got all these     
asteroids kind of banging in.   

1371
00:58:50,885 --> 00:58:54,253
Now one other thing that I      
was hoping would happen.        

1372
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,421
But it didn't, so               
I'll have to explain.           

1373
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,623
What could happen is when       
we put our ship here,           

1374
00:58:58,692 --> 00:59:01,359
what happens if there's         
an asteroid inside the shield?  

1375
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:04,294
It's gonna be stock there       
forever, bouncing around, and   

1376
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:05,361
Okay?                           

1377
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:06,362
wrecked the ship.               

1378
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:09,833
So, for the purpose of my       
game, I'm not going to allow    

1379
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:12,267
an asteroid to be created       
where my ship is.               

1380
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:15,737
And that's why,                 
this ad asteroid up here.       

1381
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:16,704
Add asteroid counts.            

1382
00:59:16,773 --> 00:59:20,542
It has another argument         
which is exclusion zone.        

1383
00:59:20,611 --> 00:59:22,610
Okay, the exclusion zone        
is just an area where           

1384
00:59:22,678 --> 00:59:24,979
don't put an asteroid here      
because my ship is going to be  

1385
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:26,346
here basically.                 

1386
00:59:26,415 --> 00:59:27,480
And so,                         
what am I going to put there?   

1387
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:29,282
I'm gonna put                   
the ship dock invert.           

1388
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:35,421
The ship's bounds to            
Gastroville, that's right.      

1389
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,757
Yes, okay, so sorry, I'm        
using this convert to method,   

1390
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:42,027
the same one we used,           
before in a previous demo.      

1391
00:59:42,096 --> 00:59:43,695
I'm just converting             
the ships balance,              

1392
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:45,930
its rectangle from its          
coordinate system,              

1393
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,132
to the asteroid field's         
coordinate system.              

1394
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:49,700
So that'll keep                 
us from getting                 

1395
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:50,800
an asteroid crater              
in the middle.                  

1396
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,904
All right, so let's make our    
game a little bit better,       

1397
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:56,305
because right now, the          
asteroid is just killing us.    

1398
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:58,140
They're constantly              
banging our shield.             

1399
00:59:58,209 --> 00:59:59,575
So instead,                     
what we're going to do,         

1400
00:59:59,644 --> 01:00:02,477
instead of having               
the reference bounds collider   

1401
01:00:02,546 --> 01:00:04,079
that's keeping all              
the asteroids in,               

1402
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,648
we're going to let              
the asteroids fly away.         

1403
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,649
But if they fly outside         
of our asteroid field,          

1404
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:09,950
we're going to                  
pick them up and                

1405
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:12,352
move them around to             
the other side, okay.           

1406
01:00:12,421 --> 01:00:14,988
So, we're gonna create an       
infinite space by doing wrap    

1407
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:17,691
around okay, I don't think      
that's how the universe         

1408
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,792
actually works,                 
although we don't know.         

1409
01:00:19,861 --> 01:00:21,426
But that's how our universe     
is gonna work, okay.            

1410
01:00:21,495 --> 01:00:23,662
Anytime something goes off      
one side we're gonna wrap it    

1411
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:24,329
around to the other side.       

1412
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:26,097
And anytime it goes off         
the top we'll wrap it around    

1413
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,966
the bottom,                     
kinda like table view does.     

1414
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:30,968
Now we will only have 20        
asteroids in our field but      

1415
01:00:31,037 --> 01:00:32,736
we'd constantly                 
be reusing them.                

1416
01:00:32,804 --> 01:00:34,370
And the other thing I'm         
gonna do is I'm gonna make      

1417
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:37,374
my asteroid field much bigger,  
that way the user won't notice  

1418
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:40,676
that I'm doing this wrap        
around thing, okay.             

1419
01:00:40,745 --> 01:00:43,278
So the two things will,         
it's a good, easy,              

1420
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:46,915
quick simulation of having      
an infinite asteroid field.     

1421
01:00:46,984 --> 01:00:48,249
So, how are we                  
gonna make it so                

1422
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,186
these things wrap around,       
okay?                           

1423
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:53,321
I don't wanna,                  
it's just math to do that,      

1424
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,855
so I don't wanna type           
too much of it in.              

1425
01:00:54,924 --> 01:00:57,257
So, I actually                  
have a little pre               

1426
01:00:57,326 --> 01:01:00,093
typed in thing here to          
show you that, recapture.       

1427
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:01,161
So here it is right here.       

1428
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,162
Okay, this is all the code      

1429
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:05,064
that does that recapturing,     
recapturing.                    

1430
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,165
The basis of it is a timer.     

1431
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:10,201
So every half a second or       
so, I'm just gonna look and     

1432
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,738
find all of the asteroids       
that are outside and            

1433
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:15,906
move them around                
to the other side.              

1434
01:01:15,975 --> 01:01:16,874
Okay, very, very simple.        

1435
01:01:16,942 --> 01:01:18,108
So, add this timer and          

1436
01:01:18,176 --> 01:01:19,810
look that you can see           
this code right here.           

1437
01:01:19,878 --> 01:01:21,978
It's just looking for           
ones that are outside.          

1438
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:26,015
It's using mod basically,       
to, modulo, to move them        

1439
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:29,018
back to the other side, either  
horizontally or vertically.     

1440
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:31,252
And notice here,                
very importantly though,        

1441
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:35,323
when I move them, I tell        
the animator that I move them.  

1442
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,158
Because if I don't,             
let's say I have an asteroid,   

1443
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:39,961
flies off the field right       
here and I'm moving back.       

1444
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,896
The next time your              
animator ticks,                 

1445
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:42,962
it's gonna move it              
back over here.                 

1446
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:43,896
You see?                        

1447
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:46,399
Because the animator he's       
got a hold of that asteroid.    

1448
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:48,100
So, if I'm gonna move           
the asteroid over here,         

1449
01:01:48,169 --> 01:01:49,568
I have to let                   
the animator know.              

1450
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:51,203
So that's why we have           
this line right here,           

1451
01:01:51,271 --> 01:01:54,239
updateItem(usingCurrentState),  
which tells the animator,       

1452
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:56,608
here's the new position of      
this thing, keep animating it,  

1453
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:59,610
from here, okay?                

1454
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:01,879
Understand that very important  
line of code right there?       

1455
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:06,950
I'm also keeping count of the   
recaptures, because it might    

1456
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:09,485
actually be a good score for    
my asteroid game.               

1457
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:10,719
Because the faster I go,        

1458
01:02:10,788 --> 01:02:12,988
the more recapturing is going   
to be happening, of course,     

1459
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:15,357
the more risk I'm taking        
of smashing into something,     

1460
01:02:15,426 --> 01:02:17,725
too, so                         
it's kinda good risk reward.    

1461
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:20,295
Maybe I could use recapture     
count as part of or             

1462
01:02:20,364 --> 01:02:23,864
all of my scoring mechanism or  
whatever.                       

1463
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:26,600
So, I have this start           
recapturing wayward asterisks   

1464
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:27,367
that starts the timer.          

1465
01:02:27,436 --> 01:02:29,535
And then,                       
stop which stops the timer.     

1466
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:30,904
So, when should I stop and      

1467
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:34,206
start this timer that's doing   
this wrap around business?      

1468
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:37,510
Well obviously,                 
if I add an asteroid.           

1469
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:40,445
I need to start recapturing,    
okay?                           

1470
01:02:40,514 --> 01:02:42,614
Because once an asteroid        
enters the field,               

1471
01:02:42,683 --> 01:02:45,483
we've got to start capturing    
otherwise, it will get loose.   

1472
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,785
And similarly,                  
when I remove an asteroid,      

1473
01:02:47,853 --> 01:02:54,057
if I remove the last asteroid,  
so if asteroids was empty,      

1474
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:56,427
then I would want to            
stop recapturing.               

1475
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,662
But that's not all, okay.       

1476
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,198
There's one other time that     
we want to stop this timer.     

1477
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:07,069
That's if the animation stops,  
okay.                           

1478
01:03:07,137 --> 01:03:10,639
If the animator stops           
animating his asteroids off     

1479
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,574
in the universe,                
then we stop recapturing them.  

1480
01:03:13,643 --> 01:03:14,942
We don't want our               
timer running then.             

1481
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:19,013
So how do we find out that      
our animator stopped?           

1482
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:23,283
Well, this is his method that   
is implemented in the super     

1483
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:25,852
class here, our super           
class UI dynamic behavior       

1484
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:29,822
called willMove to and          
it tells you when you've moved  

1485
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,425
to a new dynamic animator       
including when you've moved     

1486
01:03:32,494 --> 01:03:35,761
out of all dynamic              
animators by moving to nil.     

1487
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:36,661
Dynamic animators.              

1488
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:41,733
So, let's go down here and      
put that, maybe right here.     

1489
01:03:41,802 --> 01:03:44,902
So it's called willMove to,     
you can see it it right there.  

1490
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,405
And I'm gonna call super,       
because I inherit it.           

1491
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:49,006
I don't know that my            
superclass actually does        

1492
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,775
anything, but I don't           
wanna take any chances.         

1493
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:54,577
So here,                        
what am I gonna do in here.     

1494
01:03:54,646 --> 01:04:00,183
Well, if the dynamic animature  
that I was added to is nil.     

1495
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,650
That means that                 
animation stopped.              

1496
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,221
So, I'm gonna stop recapturing  
wayward asteroids, however,     

1497
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:09,324
if I was added to a dynamic     
animator tha's not nil.         

1498
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:11,960
Now, I want to                  
start recapturing               

1499
01:04:12,029 --> 01:04:14,595
as long as I have at            
least one asteroid.             

1500
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:16,297
So, I'm gonna say               
asteroid is not empty.          

1501
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:23,371
Is empty, look at that, hm,     
that asteroids is empty.        

1502
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:26,840
If, that's why.                 

1503
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:29,408
If asteroid's not empty,        

1504
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:31,677
then I'm going to               
start recapturing.              

1505
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:33,945
Okay, so do you see how         
if my behavior's added to       

1506
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:36,081
an animator and moved from      
an animator, boom, I'm gonna    

1507
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:39,417
start and stop my timer that    
does the recapture as well.     

1508
01:04:39,485 --> 01:04:41,185
So, you got to think about      
these things when these         

1509
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:41,885
timers are going.               

1510
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:43,720
You don't want the timers       
running wild, okay.             

1511
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:46,088
You got to think about when     
appropriate time to start and   

1512
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:48,157
stop them is.                   

1513
01:04:48,226 --> 01:04:51,126
Okay, now that we are           
recapturing, I don't need this  

1514
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:54,096
collision boundary here that    
is the reference now, so        

1515
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:55,797
I'm gonna comment that out.     

1516
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:58,366
I'm also going to stop having   

1517
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:00,902
the asteroids collide           
with each other.                

1518
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,404
I'm only gonna have it collide  
it with the ship's shield.      

1519
01:05:03,472 --> 01:05:08,575
So, I'm gonna change this from  
everything to boundaries.       

1520
01:05:08,644 --> 01:05:10,443
Okay, so it's only going        
to collide with boundaries,     

1521
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,012
the asteroid's only going       
to collide with the ship,       

1522
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,646
basically.                      

1523
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:14,580
The other thing I'm gonna do,   

1524
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:16,448
is make the asteroid            
field really big.               

1525
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:18,283
This is going to make           
the asteroids larger too,       

1526
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:20,452
which I think will              
look better as well.            

1527
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:21,685
And so, I'm gonna do            
that just by taking,            

1528
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:23,721
see where I asteroid            
field right here.               

1529
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,189
You can see the sizes           
[INAUDIBLE] bounce that size.   

1530
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:28,558
I've got a constant for         
how much bigger to make it, so  

1531
01:05:28,627 --> 01:05:32,762
I'm going to multiply this      
by constant.asteroid field      

1532
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,130
magnitude, okay?                

1533
01:05:34,198 --> 01:05:35,797
And asteroid field magnitude,   
let's look and                  

1534
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:37,967
see what I set it to, ten.      

1535
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:41,203
So, ten times larger            
than our view.                  

1536
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:45,140
That's how big our asteroid     
field is gonna be.              

1537
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,141
Now, do I, why don't I          
make it 100 or 1,000?           

1538
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:48,876
Okay, well it's not free        
to make views that large.       

1539
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:53,580
Views have backing stores for   
drawing things efficiently,     

1540
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:57,016
you wouldn't want it to be      
infinitely large like that.     

1541
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:59,352
You wanna pick a reasonable     
size for efficiency.            

1542
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:00,953
Ten times is fine, okay.        

1543
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:01,654
100 times?                      
1,000 times?                    

1544
01:06:01,722 --> 01:06:03,289
No, you wouldn't want           
it to go 1,000 times.           

1545
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,127
Okay, so                        
now let's see if that worked.   

1546
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:16,633
Okay, so now here we            
are in outer space.             

1547
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:18,134
That is really big.             

1548
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:19,336
Here come some asteroids.       

1549
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:21,104
They're just kind of,           
they got pushed so              

1550
01:06:21,173 --> 01:06:23,072
they're just wandering around.  

1551
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:25,808
This is much more               
manageable as a game.           

1552
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:29,111
More likely that we could       
manuever through these things.  

1553
01:06:29,179 --> 01:06:29,811
But to maneuver,                

1554
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,981
of course, our ship needs       
some engines, okay?             

1555
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,149
It needs to be able to move.    

1556
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:37,618
Now, we're gonna                
have our ship move              

1557
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:39,653
just like a real spaceship.     

1558
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:41,821
How does a real                 
spaceship move, okay?           

1559
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,790
It fires its engines, and       

1560
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:45,524
what happens to it when         
it fires its engines?           

1561
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:46,893
It accelerates, and             

1562
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,828
it keeps accelerating as long   
as its engines are firing.      

1563
01:06:49,897 --> 01:06:52,331
As soon as its engines turn     
off, what happens to it then?   

1564
01:06:53,566 --> 01:06:54,766
No longer accelerates but       

1565
01:06:54,835 --> 01:06:56,634
it keeps its velocity           
cuz it's in outer space.        

1566
01:06:56,703 --> 01:06:58,535
Okay, so                        
there's nothing to stop it,     

1567
01:06:58,604 --> 01:06:59,202
so it just keeps going.         

1568
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:02,239
But it's doesn't decelerate,    
nor does it keep accelerating.  

1569
01:07:02,307 --> 01:07:04,941
It goes no acceleration but     
its velocity stays the same.    

1570
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,942
So, we're gonna do              
exact same thing here.          

1571
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:09,845
So, how do we do acceleration?  

1572
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:11,647
Like that in behaviors.         

1573
01:07:11,716 --> 01:07:14,215
We use a gravity                
behavior because gravity        

1574
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:15,984
is acceleration                 
due to gravity,                 

1575
01:07:16,052 --> 01:07:18,385
due due to the Earth's pull,    
right, pulling things down.     

1576
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:21,121
They're accelerating at 9.8     
meters per second squared, and  

1577
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,523
we can have the same            
kind of behavior here.          

1578
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:25,592
And our gravity behavior        
is great because we can         

1579
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,059
have it pointed                 
in any direction.               

1580
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:28,894
So which direction              
are we gonna have               

1581
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:31,163
our gravity behavior point?     

1582
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:34,299
The, yes, the opposite          
direction of the ship, okay.    

1583
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:36,801
And that's gonna cause all      
the asteroids to move as if     

1584
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,535
the ship were going here.       

1585
01:07:37,604 --> 01:07:39,403
Because we don't actually       
want our ship to move.          

1586
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,737
We want the asteroids to move.  

1587
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,239
So we're just gonna             
apply gravity in                

1588
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:44,007
the opposite direction          
the ship is pointing.           

1589
01:07:44,076 --> 01:07:46,208
Simple as that, and that's      
gonna cause acceleration.       

1590
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:47,576
And we're gonna start           
accelerating and                

1591
01:07:47,645 --> 01:07:48,910
those asteroids                 
are gonna start moving.         

1592
01:07:48,979 --> 01:07:49,878
If we stop accelerating,        

1593
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:52,781
they're gonna keep on moving    
because there's no friction in  

1594
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:54,114
outer space.                    

1595
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:55,249
So if we want them              
to slow down,                   

1596
01:07:55,317 --> 01:07:56,717
we're gonna have to turn        
our ship around and             

1597
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,886
fire our engines the other      
direction, okay?                

1598
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,454
So that's how this              
is gonna work.                  

1599
01:08:01,523 --> 01:08:03,122
Okay, so                        
let's see if we can do that,    

1600
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:05,357
add a gravity behavior          
to our behavior.                

1601
01:08:05,426 --> 01:08:07,560
So we're gonna go               
back to behavior.               

1602
01:08:07,628 --> 01:08:09,327
Here it is, we got collider,    
we got physics,                 

1603
01:08:09,396 --> 01:08:13,865
we're gonna add another one,    
this is going to be a lazy var  

1604
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:16,300
I'm gonna call                  
this acceleration,              

1605
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:17,869
it's not really gravity, okay,  

1606
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:20,270
it's acceleration through       
our engines here.               

1607
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:23,741
And it's gonna be               
a UIGravityBehavior, and we'll  

1608
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:33,516
also initialize it              
with a closure And              

1609
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:37,352
inside here we will say, let    
behavior equal a UIGravity,     

1610
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:40,789
I keep typing in graphics       
there, hm, surprising,          

1611
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:42,124
the term behavior.              

1612
01:08:42,192 --> 01:08:44,960
Okay, and what do we need       
to do to initialize this        

1613
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,228
GravityBehavior to act          
like acceleration?              

1614
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:50,564
Well, when you create           
a GravityBehavior, by default,  

1615
01:08:50,633 --> 01:08:53,500
the gravity is 1.0              
that's a thousand               

1616
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:58,672
points per second squared,      
in the down direction, okay?    

1617
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,474
And so, we don't want that,     
we want gravity to start out    

1618
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:04,077
zero, cause we're in outer      
space, we're just floating,     

1619
01:09:04,145 --> 01:09:06,378
we're not accelerating,         
our engines are not going.      

1620
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:10,783
So, we're gonna have our        
behavior.magnitude be zero.     

1621
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:16,421
Now I'm, I could make this      
private and add API like I did  

1622
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,656
for my collider,                
where I had set boundary.       

1623
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:21,158
But I'm go ahead, gonna go      
ahead and leave this public.    

1624
01:09:21,227 --> 01:09:22,393
And what that                   
essentially does,               

1625
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:24,894
when you leave something        
public like an outlet           

1626
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:26,696
in your controller, or          
something like that,            

1627
01:09:26,765 --> 01:09:30,966
it exports this entire          
API of UIGravityBehavior        

1628
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:33,468
into the API of yours, because  
you're making this public, so   

1629
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,370
now people can do               
anything they want.             

1630
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,040
To that acceleration            
bar right there.                

1631
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:40,708
The grabby behavior only        
has a couple of methods or      

1632
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,677
a couple of bars magnitude and  
angle,                          

1633
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:46,146
basically it also has vector    
which is basically the angle.   

1634
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,014
So it's not so bad.             

1635
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,247
We're not exporting             
that much API.                  

1636
01:09:48,316 --> 01:09:50,883
But we also want to be careful  
when we make a bar public that  

1637
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:54,454
we intend to let                
people do this, okay?           

1638
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,120
Which we do.                    

1639
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:57,322
We're gonna allow               
people to do that.              

1640
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:59,124
So, when we add                 
a new behavior,                 

1641
01:09:59,192 --> 01:09:59,925
what do we need to do?          

1642
01:10:01,862 --> 01:10:02,392
Right here.                     

1643
01:10:02,461 --> 01:10:04,361
Okay, don't forget these.       

1644
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,296
So, let's go here again.        

1645
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:08,431
Child behavior for              
the acceleration.               

1646
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,102
And also down here we're gonna  
add all of our asteroids so     

1647
01:10:13,171 --> 01:10:16,205
they're affected by             
the acceleration.               

1648
01:10:16,274 --> 01:10:19,508
And we've got to remove         
items when they get removed.    

1649
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,213
Okay, don't forget that         
part or it won't work.          

1650
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:26,047
Okay, so that's it.             

1651
01:10:26,116 --> 01:10:29,183
Now we've got gravity, let's    
go back to our controller and   

1652
01:10:29,252 --> 01:10:30,517
get our engines to fire.        

1653
01:10:30,586 --> 01:10:32,419
Now, how are we gonna           
fire our engines?               

1654
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:36,389
We clearly need a gesture       
to fire our engines.            

1655
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:39,559
So, I'm gonna use a gesture     
called a long press, okay,      

1656
01:10:39,627 --> 01:10:42,594
a long press is a press         
that you hold down.             

1657
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:44,597
And as long as you hold         
it down it keeps firing.        

1658
01:10:44,665 --> 01:10:46,831
So it's a continues gesture     
like a pan gesture or           

1659
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,533
something like that.            

1660
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:52,070
But you don't, it just,         
you press and hold, okay?       

1661
01:10:52,139 --> 01:10:54,205
Very, very similar to           
a pan gesture actually.         

1662
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:55,939
But the long press              
will be configured for          

1663
01:10:56,008 --> 01:10:58,609
other things, how long to       
wait until you recognize it,    

1664
01:10:58,677 --> 01:11:00,176
which I am actually             
going to set to zero so         

1665
01:11:00,245 --> 01:11:02,878
it instantly recognizes         
my finger going down.           

1666
01:11:02,947 --> 01:11:05,247
You can also have long press    
do things like if you move it,  

1667
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:06,082
it stops working.               

1668
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:08,450
And of course we want           
our long press to keep          

1669
01:11:08,518 --> 01:11:11,286
following it around keep        
just a pan gesture.             

1670
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:12,053
But you can make it so          

1671
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:14,921
a long press if you move it     
too far up now it stops firing  

1672
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,557
so that's the difference.       

1673
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,657
I just wanted to                
show it to you so               

1674
01:11:17,726 --> 01:11:19,659
you can see a pan gesture,      
what it looks like.             

1675
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,961
So let's go back to our         
storyboard here and             

1676
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:22,762
add that pan gesture.           

1677
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:24,363
I'm gonna add it in             
the storyboard rather than      

1678
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:25,330
in code.                        

1679
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:27,632
So here's my controller right   
here, I'm gonna go down and     

1680
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,833
find it by searching for        
gesture.                        

1681
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:32,470
If you go down these things at  
the bottom there's Tap, Pinch,  

1682
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,904
Rotation, Swipe.                

1683
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:36,039
Here it is, Long Press,         
I'm gonna drag it out,          

1684
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:38,174
I'm gonna apply it              
to my self.view.                

1685
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:41,077
So my self.view is going        
to handle this gesture.         

1686
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:43,378
Okay, my controller is          
gonna get it, sorry,            

1687
01:11:43,447 --> 01:11:46,215
self.view is going to           
recognize this gesture and      

1688
01:11:46,284 --> 01:11:49,117
my controller is going          
to handle the gesture by        

1689
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:51,919
Causing our ship to             
burn its engines and            

1690
01:11:51,988 --> 01:11:54,989
cause that                      
acceleration increase.          

1691
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:57,591
And remember, when we drop,     
drag this in here,              

1692
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,961
it adds up here, I can click    
on it, I can even inspect it.   

1693
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:03,563
Here's where I can say things   
like the minimum duration is    

1694
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:06,900
zero or the tolerance           
of how many points              

1695
01:12:06,968 --> 01:12:10,737
you wanna allow it to get to    
move before it stops firing.    

1696
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:13,706
The person jerks their          
finger away or whatever.        

1697
01:12:13,775 --> 01:12:15,908
You can do all                  
this right here.                

1698
01:12:15,976 --> 01:12:17,475
And I'm just gonna              
have this thing.                

1699
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:20,711
I'm gonna control drag it to    
cause an action to happen.      

1700
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,747
Let's put it,                   
let's put it right here.        

1701
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:25,015
So we'll control                
drag over to here.              

1702
01:12:25,084 --> 01:12:26,784
It's gonna do an action.        

1703
01:12:26,853 --> 01:12:28,418
It's gonna have                 
the LongPressGesture as         

1704
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:29,252
the argument.                   

1705
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,021
We'll call this burn cuz        
we're gonna burn our            

1706
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,389
engines here, okay?             

1707
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,225
So what's gonna happen here     
is, my finger goes down,        

1708
01:12:36,294 --> 01:12:39,060
I'm gonna turn the ship         
towards my finger, and          

1709
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:40,529
turn on the engines.            

1710
01:12:40,597 --> 01:12:42,997
And when I let go,              
I'll turn off the engines.      

1711
01:12:43,065 --> 01:12:44,665
Leave this ship in whatever     
direction it was, and           

1712
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,399
turn it off, and                
it can start drifting.          

1713
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:49,402
Okay, press the finger down,    
ship's gonna quickly turn,      

1714
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:51,371
and you know,                   
if I were doing a real app,     

1715
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:53,139
I'd probably have that          
turn be animated, but           

1716
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,574
I'm gonna have                  
a jerk down there,              

1717
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:56,575
but you guys know how           
to do view animation.           

1718
01:12:56,644 --> 01:12:58,610
You could easily have that      
rotation be animated.           

1719
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:00,311
And that's how                  
it's gonna work.                

1720
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,880
So you press and hold,          
and it'll accelerate            

1721
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:05,649
in whatever direction you       
wanna do, wanna do there.       

1722
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:08,784
All right, so let's go          
back to our controller and      

1723
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:09,853
implement this burn.            

1724
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:12,454
So here is our                  
burn right here.                

1725
01:13:12,523 --> 01:13:13,655
So how's the burn gonna work?   

1726
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,524
Well, I'm gonna switch          
on the sender.state.            

1727
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:18,192
That's the recognizer state.    

1728
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:22,663
And right from when it began,   
and also every time it changed  

1729
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,732
I'm going to turn the ship      
towards the finger, and         

1730
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,667
believe it or not, I can do     
that in one line of code.       

1731
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,936
Okay, what did I                
do wrong there?                 

1732
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,505
Maybe just not enough of,       
yeah.                           

1733
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,041
Okay so                         
how am I gonna do that?         

1734
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:37,075
I'm gonna say ship.direction,   
and                             

1735
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:41,179
I want to set this to where     
my finger is relative to        

1736
01:13:41,247 --> 01:13:45,550
the center of the ship as an    
angle, that 0 to 2 pi angle.    

1737
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,519
So the first thing I'm gonna    
do is I have added in my        

1738
01:13:48,588 --> 01:13:51,321
core graphics stuff a way       
to subtract two points and      

1739
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,891
get a vector between            
the two points, so              

1740
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,525
you just use minus to do it.    

1741
01:13:55,594 --> 01:13:57,860
So I'm gonna say this is the,   

1742
01:13:57,929 --> 01:14:02,298
make sure I use the right       
variable names here, we do,     

1743
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:06,969
yes, okay, so this is           
the sender's location in        

1744
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:10,772
our self.view, right,           
this is our controller.         

1745
01:14:10,841 --> 01:14:12,807
Minus the ship's centers.       

1746
01:14:12,876 --> 01:14:16,244
So that gives me a CG vector    
vector between those two, and   

1747
01:14:16,313 --> 01:14:18,980
vector, I added                 
a method called angle           

1748
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:22,016
which turns that vector         
into a zero two pi angle.       

1749
01:14:22,085 --> 01:14:24,051
So you see how I can            
make this really cool.          

1750
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:27,321
One line of code if I have      
these old CG extensions.        

1751
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,022
So that's something             
to think about when             

1752
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,489
you are writing                 
your code as well.              

1753
01:14:30,558 --> 01:14:33,192
And then of course I wanna      
burn too, I wanna turn          

1754
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,861
on my engines when this         
figure has turned out.          

1755
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,431
So I'm gonna need a private     
func burn that does that.       

1756
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:42,534
I'm also gonna need             
a private func endBurn.         

1757
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:45,637
Because when I lift my          
finger up, it needs to stop,    

1758
01:14:45,705 --> 01:14:48,705
which is in the case            
that it ended.                  

1759
01:14:48,774 --> 01:14:50,574
endBurn, okay?                  

1760
01:14:50,642 --> 01:14:53,076
Otherwise we'll just ignore,    
okay?                           

1761
01:14:53,145 --> 01:14:55,378
So that's it.                   
That's my entire burn,          

1762
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,178
super simple.                   

1763
01:14:56,247 --> 01:14:58,347
So what happens when we burn?   

1764
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,650
Well, we need to set that       
acceleration gravity behavior   

1765
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:03,886
to be the opposite              
direction of my ship.           

1766
01:15:03,954 --> 01:15:08,656
Also I want to tell my ship     
that its engines are firing.    

1767
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:11,058
Okay, this is just              
a graphics thing so             

1768
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:13,928
that it draws that little       
flame coming out the back.      

1769
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:15,295
That's all that does.           

1770
01:15:15,364 --> 01:15:19,799
And so now I'm gonna say        
that my asteroid behaviors,     

1771
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:21,067
acceleration.                   

1772
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:29,743
[SOUND] Angle equals my         
ship's direction minus what?    

1773
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:36,081
Pi, right?                      

1774
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,615
Zero to two pi is               
all the way round,              

1775
01:15:37,684 --> 01:15:39,851
so pi is half way               
around that circle.             

1776
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:44,888
And then my asteroid            
behavior magnitude.             

1777
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,157
So for                          
the magnitude of the burn,      

1778
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:50,493
this is something that          
we would need to.               

1779
01:15:50,562 --> 01:15:51,761
Sorry.                          
Acceleration.                   

1780
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,362
This is something we            
need to play with               

1781
01:15:53,431 --> 01:15:54,897
to kind of get the right one.   

1782
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:56,064
I have a constant for it so     

1783
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:58,133
that I can kinda work           
on the constant.                

1784
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:00,334
You know,                       
I was home developing my        

1785
01:16:00,403 --> 01:16:01,635
app I called                    
Burn Acceleration,              

1786
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:04,405
I think it's what is            
burn acceleration?              

1787
01:16:04,474 --> 01:16:06,840
Okay, .07,                      
points per second per second.   

1788
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:09,176
That's a not                    
really light burn.              

1789
01:16:09,244 --> 01:16:11,010
But, you know,                  
as you hold that finger down,   

1790
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:13,646
that thing's gonna start going  
faster and faster, and faster,  

1791
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:16,148
and faster, cuz you're          
constantly accelerating, okay?  

1792
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:17,249
It's not just that              
you're going fast.              

1793
01:16:17,317 --> 01:16:18,916
You're accelerating             
going faster and faster,        

1794
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:21,485
the longer you hold             
that finger down.               

1795
01:16:21,554 --> 01:16:23,955
Now the end burn is to just     
tell the ship that the engines  

1796
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:25,222
are no longer firing.           

1797
01:16:26,926 --> 01:16:30,026
And we'll make the asteroid     
behavior's acceleration         

1798
01:16:30,095 --> 01:16:31,561
magnitude back to zero.         

1799
01:16:32,764 --> 01:16:34,029
So we stopped accelerating.     

1800
01:16:34,098 --> 01:16:35,897
And we'll leave the ship        

1801
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,365
pointing whichever              
way it's pointing.              

1802
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:40,668
Everyone cool with this little  
bit of code right here?         

1803
01:16:40,737 --> 01:16:43,671
So that's all we need to        
do to get this ship moving.     

1804
01:16:51,914 --> 01:16:53,613
All right, so here we go.       

1805
01:16:53,682 --> 01:16:54,847
I'm going to start              
accelerating                    

1806
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,682
up towards this                 
guy in the top.                 

1807
01:16:56,751 --> 01:16:59,785
See, see how he's coming        
down to me, no, you be.         

1808
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,286
Okay, I'll keep accelerating.   

1809
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:04,990
Now you're gonna start to see   
the asteroids really rip by me  

1810
01:17:05,058 --> 01:17:08,660
faster and faster and faster    
in the down direction there.    

1811
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:09,693
See that?                       

1812
01:17:09,762 --> 01:17:11,829
Now if I wanna slow them down,  

1813
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:16,233
I got to turn my ship around    
and slow down here, okay, see?  

1814
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:17,868
I'm accelerating the other,     
too late,                       

1815
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:19,535
I got destroyed                 
before I did that.              

1816
01:17:19,604 --> 01:17:20,703
But it still keeps              
slowing down.                   

1817
01:17:20,772 --> 01:17:23,338
Slow down, slow down,           
slow down.                      

1818
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:25,908
Okay, now I'm starting to go    
the other direction, okay?      

1819
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:28,410
Finally caught up with that     
one and now they start going    

1820
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:31,545
the other way, so I'm           
continuing to accelerate here.  

1821
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:35,049
I'm destroyed again, okay?      

1822
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:36,183
Does everyone see               
the way that works?             

1823
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:38,051
Now if you were actually        
playing the actual game,        

1824
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,019
you wouldn't be doing this      
massive acceleration.           

1825
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,822
If you're doing sh, little      
tiny move, move, tiny move.     

1826
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,757
Look for the, things coming,    

1827
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:48,428
little more trying to go        
another direction, etc.         

1828
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:53,164
I've got time for               
one more thing.                 

1829
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:58,102
I think, I'll do one real       
quick one, which is if          

1830
01:17:58,171 --> 01:18:00,872
you notice if I hold down this  
thing and start accelerating,   

1831
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,641
some of the asteroids           
are going super fast.           

1832
01:18:03,709 --> 01:18:06,510
I mean just like so             
fast you can barely see them,   

1833
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:08,511
they just blink going across.   

1834
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,314
This is another problem we      
gotta fix is not letting our    

1835
01:18:11,383 --> 01:18:13,383
asteroids be stopped and        
caught in the middle.           

1836
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:17,052
But that super duper fast       
asteroids, we don't want that,  

1837
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:18,120
because at some                 
point they go so                

1838
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:19,854
fast that the user              
can't even see them, so         

1839
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:20,621
they're kind of useless.        

1840
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,556
They're not even on there.      

1841
01:18:21,624 --> 01:18:24,592
So what if we put a speed       
limit on our asteroids?         

1842
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,695
How would we put a speed limit  
on our asteroids, because       

1843
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:30,263
we can infinitely accelerate    
our shift faster and faster,    

1844
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:32,365
and faster, so how could        
we put a speed limit?           

1845
01:18:32,434 --> 01:18:35,167
Well, the way we're going do a  
speed limit is we're going to   

1846
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,335
cap the linear accelerate,      

1847
01:18:36,404 --> 01:18:40,072
the linear velocity             
rather of the items.            

1848
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:42,073
And if you remember             
from the slides,                

1849
01:18:42,142 --> 01:18:45,042
this dynamic item               
behavior right here,            

1850
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:48,312
it knows what the linear        
velocity is of all its items,   

1851
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:51,749
and it can, you can set the     
linear velocity of its items.   

1852
01:18:51,817 --> 01:18:54,318
So, in init here,               
those are init,                 

1853
01:18:54,386 --> 01:18:58,422
I'm actually going to           
set a sped limit here.          

1854
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,124
Okay, so                        
this little piece of code       

1855
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:03,392
sets a speed limit              
on all the items.               

1856
01:19:03,461 --> 01:19:06,896
And how does this thing work,   
okay?                           

1857
01:19:06,964 --> 01:19:08,396
First of all,                   
I'm gonna have to have a var,   

1858
01:19:08,465 --> 01:19:10,965
which is the speedLimit,        
which is a CGFloat, and         

1859
01:19:11,034 --> 01:19:14,803
I'm gonna set it to 300         
points per second, okay?        

1860
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:17,705
All these, the linearVelocity   
is your points per second.      

1861
01:19:17,773 --> 01:19:21,041
And the way this works is it    
just gets the linearVelocity    

1862
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,111
for an item using this          
linearVelocity for method.      

1863
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,846
Then it calculates the excess   
velocity as a negative          

1864
01:19:26,915 --> 01:19:28,114
number, okay?                   

1865
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:30,083
By subtracting                  
the speed limit,                

1866
01:19:30,152 --> 01:19:33,285
subtracting the velocity        
from the speed limit.           

1867
01:19:33,354 --> 01:19:36,255
Caps it out at zero, so         
it's always a negative number.  

1868
01:19:36,323 --> 01:19:39,291
And then just adds that         
negative number back in as      

1869
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,258
a linear velocity.              

1870
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:44,162
That's always, anytime          
an asteroid tries to go faster  

1871
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:45,062
than the speed limit,           

1872
01:19:45,131 --> 01:19:47,631
it slows it back down by        
adding enough linear velocity,  

1873
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,667
negative linear velocity        
to slow it down.                

1874
01:19:51,836 --> 01:19:55,305
And, we did all this, by the    
way, with this action thing.    

1875
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:59,108
Remember the action var         
where we can execute            

1876
01:19:59,177 --> 01:20:03,512
a block of code every           
time that it acts?              

1877
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:06,181
So the physics are acting       
all the time because            

1878
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,416
you know the physics is         
always being in effect.         

1879
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:09,684
So now if I accelerate,         

1880
01:20:09,753 --> 01:20:14,055
no matter, even if I keep this  
engine down full speed, you     

1881
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:15,855
can see these things, that's    
as fast as they right there.    

1882
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:17,591
They've kind reached            
there speed limit,              

1883
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:20,360
which does appear to be         
about 300 points per second.    

1884
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:21,227
This screen,                    

1885
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:23,462
I don't know, it's maybe        
a thousand points wide.         

1886
01:20:23,531 --> 01:20:25,697
Takes about 3 seconds, or       

1887
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:28,733
a little less than              
that to go across.              

1888
01:20:28,802 --> 01:20:31,102
Okay, so                        
this action allows to do it.    

1889
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,836
Now, this is executed a lot,    

1890
01:20:32,905 --> 01:20:35,707
because this action's           
happening a lot.                

1891
01:20:35,775 --> 01:20:37,808
So, we want this code           
to be quite efficient.          

1892
01:20:37,877 --> 01:20:40,844
I might even go so              
far in here, as to not call     

1893
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:44,113
addLinearVelocity if these      
two numbers are both zero.      

1894
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:46,048
I'm not sure whether            
addLinearVelocity               

1895
01:20:46,117 --> 01:20:48,150
does anything if                
those are both zero.            

1896
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:51,119
But I want this little          
thing to be so fast that        

1897
01:20:51,188 --> 01:20:54,523
I don't wanna take any chances  
there, and I have to do this.   

1898
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:56,291
I can't get linearVelocity      
otherwise and                   

1899
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,393
I have to do this small         
little tiny calculations, so    

1900
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,259
I'm not worried about those,    

1901
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:00,828
but this one maybe              
I'll make optional.             

1902
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:03,930
Okay, so that's it.             

1903
01:21:03,999 --> 01:21:04,997
That's it for                   
dynamic animation.              

1904
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:09,035
Hopefully, hey, this was kind   
of fun, feel free to take it    

1905
01:21:09,104 --> 01:21:12,070
and add some features           
to it if you want.              

1906
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,838
But hopefully you've            
learned all the things          

1907
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:15,006
we need to do there.            

1908
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:17,642
And make sure hopefully         
all of you submit your          

1909
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:20,110
proposals and all that.         

1910
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:22,145
And make sure you're getting    
started on that final project.  

1911
01:21:22,214 --> 01:21:23,479
Don't wait til                  
the last minute.                

1912
01:21:23,548 --> 01:21:24,613
Use that crossword puddle,      

1913
01:21:24,682 --> 01:21:29,018
puzzle mentality where let      
things ruminate, okay?          

1914
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:29,752
See ya next time.               

1915
