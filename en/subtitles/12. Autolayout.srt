>> Welcome to                   
Standford CS 193P,

00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:13,977
Developing Applications for     
iOS, Winter of 2017.            

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,746
This is lecture number 12, and  

6
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:20,650
today our topic is              
going to be Autolayout.         

7
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:23,886
I'm going to review a little    
bit of what we already know     

8
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:25,120
about Autolayout and            

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,057
then move onto a very           
important part of auto layout   

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,727
called size classes then we'll  
demo everything as usual.       

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,264
What have you seen in           
Autolayout already?             

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,565
Well, you know about            
the dash blue lines.            

13
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,268
When you drag things out and    
move them around and            

14
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:44,605
you make those dash blue lines  
appear you know that it helps   

15
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:47,874
Xcode when you wanna do Reset   
to Suggested Constraints.       

16
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:50,376
And you know that               
sometimes Reset to              

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,446
Suggested Constraints doesn't   
really do what you want.        

18
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:57,616
It really only works if those   
blue lines just unambiguously   

19
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:58,483
obviously.                      

20
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:01,152
That's what you wanted.         

21
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,055
But you also know that          
after you do something,         

22
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:06,490
especially after you do reset   
to suggest the constraints,     

23
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,560
you can go over to              
the Size Inspector and          

24
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:14,565
click on any of the views       
in your UI and you              

25
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,433
can look at the constraints     
and it shows you them.          

26
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,736
You can even kind of hover      
over them with the mouse and    

27
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,970
they will show them             
on the screen.                  

28
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,038
Highlight them, etc.            

29
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,507
So that's a good tool to        
know what's going on.           

30
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,408
You also know that you can      
click on the constraint         

31
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,108
itself.                         

32
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:29,877
The little I beams or           
whatever,                       

33
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:32,646
you can click on them and       
bring up inspector on them and  

34
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:37,651
you can see a lot of detail:    
what the constants are,         

35
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,320
what's on either end of them,   
in other words what             

36
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,188
the constraints, the two        
things being involved and       

37
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,724
constrained are, so             
you already know that as well.  

38
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:49,027
You also know about             
control dragging                

39
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:52,097
to edges, we did a lot of       
control dragging to the edge    

40
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,400
to make our UI kinda use        
up all the space but            

41
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,502
you also saw a little bit of    
a hint in the smashtag demo     

42
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:02,740
that you can actually control   
drag between any two views.     

43
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,275
This is the key thing           
about Autolayout.               

44
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,511
It sets constraints really      
between any two views.          

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,346
There's really almost           
no restriction                  

46
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:12,748
between the things you          
can set constraints.            

47
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,651
Again so we'll see that in      
the demo a little bit today.    

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,387
Now in addition to control      
dragging to set up these        

49
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:22,724
constraints between things,     
you can also select them.       

50
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,992
I select one view or            
select a couple of views.       

51
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,495
And there's a couple little     
menus in the corner down        

52
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,230
there the pin menu or           
the align menu and              

53
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,601
then this other kinda generic   
menu that has a lot of random   

54
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,436
things you can set              
constraints for.                

55
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,970
And we'll use that              
today as well, so               

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,673
you can see that different      
way of doing it.                

57
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,508
Pretty much everything          
in there you can do with        

58
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,410
Ctrl+drag, but sometimes        
it's hard to do Ctrl+drag.      

59
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,245
Maybe the views are very        
close together, or              

60
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:48,712
they're really near the edge,   

61
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,881
or they're overlapping          
some other view.                

62
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,884
And so when that starts         
to be a problem, you can        

63
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:56,786
click on them to select,        
either using the control shift  

64
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:59,255
click to drill down if          
things are overlapping, or      

65
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,891
maybe use the document outline  
to select it, and then go to    

66
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,128
these menus to apply whatever   
constraints that you want.      

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,564
Now the document outline,       
we've showed briefly and        

68
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,367
I'll show it again today,       
is really the go to place to    

69
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,368
resolve problems                
with constraints.               

70
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:18,906
Both constraints that are       
insufficient, in other words    

71
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:22,442
you, you haven't put enough     
constraints on a view for       

72
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,945
the Xcode to or the IOS to      
know where the thing goes.      

73
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:27,781
Or constraints that conflict.   

74
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,216
Maybe you put two               
constraints on a views          

75
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,318
that is like they're pulling    
against each other and          

76
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:33,218
IOS doesn't know what to do.    

77
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:36,254
So the document outline is      
the place to go to resolve      

78
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:39,624
all that stuff and we'll        
see that in the demo today.     

79
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,793
Now one thing to understand     
about autolayout is it takes    

80
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,728
experience to master it.        

81
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,364
There's a lot of degrees        
of freedom there with those     

82
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,733
constraints in terms            
of how you can                  

83
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:53,703
constrain views relative        
to each other and               

84
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,905
there's just no substitute for  
experience.                     

85
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,540
You just have to do it.         

86
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:01,243
So don't expect that after      
you see the demo today.         

87
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,811
And after what you've seen      
earlier in the course.          

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,213
Like, "now I am an auto         
layout master".                 

89
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:08,182
You will have to be designing   
a lot of user interfaces.       

90
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,617
Lining up a lot of edges.       

91
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:13,119
Making things the same widths,  
those kinds of things.          

92
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:16,556
Until you learn kind of         
the tools enough to be a good   

93
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,423
auto layout master.             

94
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,757
But once you master it,         

95
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:22,128
it can be really really super   
powerful as you can see.        

96
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,331
Autolayout is also              
doable from code.               

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,832
In other words,                 
there is a class and            

98
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,968
it's layout constraint and      

99
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:34,205
it has all the functionality    
is in the story board.          

100
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,874
We rarely use it                
because we can do               

101
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,610
pretty much anything            
from a story board.             

102
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,111
But I'm not gonna have          
time to teach it.               

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
Obviously I have to be          
selective about what            

104
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,382
I can show you in this          
limited time available.         

105
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,151
But you can do some pretty      
tricky things in code that      

106
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:53,354
you can't do in storyboard,     
but they're pretty, I don't     

107
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:56,925
want to say advanced, but they  
are, let's say fairly obscure.  

108
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,627
And so, if you're interested    
in pursuing that, maybe for     

109
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,661
your final project, or          

110
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,164
something, you can just start   
with NSLayout constraint in     

111
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:10,504
the documentation, and          
kind of go from there.          

112
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:17,142
Let's talk a little about       
rotation, auto rotation.        

113
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,912
We know that when we rotate,    
that's one of the biggest       

114
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,515
times that autolayout has to    
kick in and figure out where    

115
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,484
things go because things        
have dramatically changed.      

116
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:28,953
They're much wider than they    
are tall now or vice versa.     

117
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:32,122
And sometimes unfortunately,    

118
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:37,661
that rotation causes such       
a dramatic change in your UI    

119
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,265
that you want to actually move  
views around in a way that you  

120
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,669
just can't say by align these   
edges, make these the same      

121
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,438
width, keep this separation,    
those kinds of things.          

122
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:51,140
You actually want to pick       
them up and move them.          

123
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,044
And actually, a great example   
of that is our calculator.      

124
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:58,880
Our calculator, at least,       
not your calculator but         

125
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,183
the calculator we last saw      
in demo had 20 buttons, and     

126
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:06,287
we had it as four across and    
five down.                      

127
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,789
And that made a lot             
of sense because                

128
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,459
in portrait mode we had         
a lot of vertical space and     

129
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,327
not a lot of horizontal space,  
so we kinda went for the.       

130
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:17,530
The five high, four wide.       

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,033
But when we switch to           
landscape, now it's not so      

132
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,702
good, cuz all of the buttons    
are squished down.              

133
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,737
They're really wide and thin.   

134
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,105
It would be much better if      
when we get to landscape,       

135
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:28,740
we could go to five across and  

136
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:32,243
four down because we            
have a lot less space.          

137
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,112
Now, can you imagine trying     
to do a control drag to         

138
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,314
make that happen is             
basically impossible.           

139
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:38,515
It can't be done.               

140
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,985
But it's possible to do         
with a very important           

141
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:44,988
feature which I'm gonna talk    
about in a moment here.         

142
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:49,425
Now, this kind of               
rotation stuff is,              

143
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,328
the problem where your view     
changes from landscape          

144
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,363
to portrait and you wanna       
move all the views around       

145
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,531
can happen in other             
situations too.                 

146
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,667
Imagine that you have an MVC    
that wants to look good in      

147
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:02,570
Landscape, but also wants to    
look good when it's the master  

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,572
of a Split View Controller.     

149
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,574
The master of a Split View      
Controller kind of looks likes  

150
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,242
it's in portrait, so            
even though you're on an iPad,  

151
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,745
let's say,                      
sometimes you have tall and     

152
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:14,180
skinny, just like what          
you have on an iPhone.          

153
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:19,518
So it's not just iPhone issue   
only or rotation issue only.    

154
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:23,255
So, the solution to all this    
is called size classes.         

155
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,791
Now, Apple has chosen to take   
an approach to dealing with     

156
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,692
this which is fairly simple.    

157
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:30,895
Which is a pretty good idea     
because you could imagine       

158
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:34,632
a very complicated solution     
that tries to, basically, take  

159
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,935
into effect every possible      
geometry and every size.        

160
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,570
You could end up writing a lot  
of code or a massive number     

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,139
of auto layout constraints      
to make it work.                

162
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,709
So they've boiled it down       
to this very simple system      

163
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:50,012
where they talk about size      
classes and a view or           

164
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,249
a view controller at any        
given time exists with          

165
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,716
a certain size class.           

166
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,384
Both in the horizontal          
direction and                   

167
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,551
the vertical direction.         

168
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,988
And the only two values that    
the size class can have is      

169
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:03,490
compact or regular.             

170
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,026
So regular is regular sized,    
and                             

171
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,696
compact means that you're       
constrained in that direction.  

172
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,733
Let's look at all               
our devices and                 

173
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:17,803
see when they're constrained    
in either compact               

174
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,373
in either height or width, and  
when they're just regular.      

175
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:25,944
Let's talk about the iPhone     
first the iPhone in portraits   

176
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,714
is regular in height,           
plenty of height, but           

177
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,215
it's compact in width.          

178
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,118
It's kinda constrained in       
width in that circumstance.     

179
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:38,255
When you switch to landscape,   
maybe surprisingly,             

180
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:42,859
iPhones are compact in both     
directions because even though  

181
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,561
when you go to landscape,       
it gets quite a bit wider,      

182
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,329
it's still not that wide.       

183
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,764
Okay, it's not                  
wide like an iPad.              

184
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,033
It's still somewhat             
constrained, so                 

185
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,969
they've decided                 
to make landscape               

186
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,037
iPhone be compact               
in both directions.             

187
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,173
So in portrait it's regular in  
height and compact in width.    

188
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,609
But in Landscape, it's          
compacted both directions.      

189
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:04,043
We will encounter into it but   

190
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,278
just see it works               
out quite nicely.               

191
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,313
Now, the iPhone +s, the 6+ and  

192
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,882
the 7+,                         
those are a little different.   

193
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,918
They're still                   
compact in width.               

194
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,820
And regular in height           
in portrait but                 

195
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,288
when you go to landscape,       

196
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,823
since those iPhone              
pluses are so                   

197
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,993
big, that they can actually     
start showing that kind of      

198
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,696
horizontal UI just like it      
was an iPad or something.       

199
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:31,734
So they are regular in          
width in landscape mode.        

200
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,502
iPhone is compact in both.      

201
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,906
The iPhone Plus, still compact  
in height, in landscape, but    

202
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,040
it's regular in width.          

203
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,176
Then the iPad.                  

204
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,947
Since it's huge, is always      
regular in both dimensions.     

205
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,550
Both width and height is        
always irregular, but           

206
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,383
that's only for                 

207
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,752
new controllers that are        
taking over the whole screen.   

208
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:53,919
If your view controller,        

209
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,154
like I said in the master       
of a split view,                

210
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,924
you're compact width,           
regular height.                 

211
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,895
Or if your multi-tasking MVC    
that comes out from the right,  

212
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,129
you all know about              
multi-tasking                   

213
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:05,863
in the iPad hopefully.          

214
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,532
You can drag anything           
out from the right and          

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,667
pick another app, and have two  
apps running side by side.      

216
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,868
Well, when you pull             
that thing out,                 

217
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:14,204
that's also gonna be a compact  
width, regular height.          

218
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,076
Now this whole mechanism        
of Compact and Regular in       

219
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:24,913
size classes, of course, it's   
built-in for devices as I've    

220
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,648
described above here, but       
it's also extensible.           

221
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:31,052
So if you were to write your    
own thing where an MVC was      

222
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,488
embedded inside another MVC.    

223
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:34,922
You could set or                

224
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,259
communicate whether that        
MVC is compact or regular.      

225
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:40,093
In each of width and            

226
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:42,562
height and kind of send         
a message to the MVC.           

227
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,830
Hey I've constrained            
your height so                  

228
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,031
make sure you deal with that.   

229
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,333
Or I've constrained             
your width.                     

230
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:50,234
And so, it can react to it.     

231
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:53,104
Now, again, I'm not gonna       
have time to talk about that    

232
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:57,975
in detail, but there is this    
bar called trait collection     

233
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,143
which you can look at           
in a view controller.           

234
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:03,113
And it will tell you what       
your current size class is,     

235
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:06,282
both horizontally and           
vertically.                     

236
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,984
And there's a mechanism for     

237
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:11,554
passing that along down to sub  
MVCs and views and things.      

238
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,390
We have the size classes,       
compact width and               

239
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,327
regular width, compact          
height and regular height,      

240
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:22,563
which makes for four different  
combinations right here and     

241
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,997
again, compact width and        

242
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,200
height is iPhones in            
landscape but not plus ones.    

243
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,001
Compact height and              

244
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,838
regular width is the iPhone     
plus only in landscape.         

245
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:35,174
Regular height and compact      
width is iPhones in portrait,   

246
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:38,477
both plusses and regular and    
also like a split view master.  

247
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:41,446
And then regular regular        
is an iPad in portrait or       

248
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,547
landscape, the whole thing.     

249
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:47,685
So if we had this normal grid   
and we wanted our calculator    

250
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:51,321
to look good in all of them     
conceivably we'd have to        

251
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,026
write, do four different UIs    
for our calculator like this.   

252
00:11:57,095 --> 00:12:01,130
When I Have some more           
vertical height.                

253
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,265
I go five high but              

254
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:06,168
when I'm kind of compacted      
I'll go to only four high.      

255
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:10,439
So this would be a bit of a     
pain in the neck to have to do  

256
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,123
To make it a little easier,     
when we are designing,          

257
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,740
this.                           

258
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,178
we also have the concept        
of any height or any width.     

259
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,181
Now if we do that, now we're    
down to only having to do two   

260
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,650
things with our calculator.     

261
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,453
So anytime we have compact      
height and we don't care        

262
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:28,988
what the width is,              
we're going to go four high.    

263
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:30,523
Anytime we have                 
regular height and              

264
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,225
we don't care what the width    
is, we'll go five high.         

265
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,894
So that's reduced the amount    
of work we have to do by half.  

266
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,598
And actually we can reduce it   
even more because we can also   

267
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,233
design any any.                 

268
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,268
This any by the way doesn't     
mean any like the Swift         

269
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,604
type "any", it just means       
any width, any height,          

270
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,705
the English word any.           

271
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,142
And so we can do our designing  
and in fact our default design  

272
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,811
in storyboards is to be         
designing any width,            

273
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,382
any height.                     

274
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,085
that are the same for the five  
wide case or the four wide      

275
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:06,388
case, we can build all          
that in the any any mode.       

276
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:10,625
And then only have to do        
the stuff that's specific to    

277
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:14,295
the size class being            
different in that case.         

278
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:18,432
So, that reduces even more      
the design we have to do.       

279
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,133
Cuz we're doing most            
of our design any any,          

280
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:23,570
and then a little bit to        
make the other two work.        

281
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,905
So, you can see it in           
the calculator here, the only   

282
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:29,575
things I can do in any/any is   
the base keyboard there, not    

283
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,311
including the buttons that are  
either gonna be on the top or   

284
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,663
because those depending on      
the vertical size class there.  

285
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,948
on the side,                    

286
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,250
And also I can do my            
display at the top.             

287
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,919
If that's all I can do.         

288
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,405
But most of my UI we'll see in  
the demo I'll do exactly this.  

289
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,823
That's a lot.                   

290
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,126
Let's jump into that.           

291
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:55,599
To make the demo a little       
easier to understand what's     

292
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,069
going on here the developer,    
here's our calculator.          

293
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:05,340
I actually added a little       

294
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,880
bit of code to my               
calculator and                  

295
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,618
I'll show it to you.            

296
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,754
This is the calculator          
that we've left off.            

297
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,256
The last thing we did           
in this calculator was          

298
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,623
the green square root.          

299
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,993
Remember so it was not changed  
since then except for this.     

300
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,528
In the view controller for      
this guy.                       

301
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:30,496
I added this blue               
code right here.                

302
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,931
I added this function           
showSizeClasses                 

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,267
which hijacks the display.      

304
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,237
You know our blue display on    
the top, it hijacks it and      

305
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:40,905
writes in there                 
what the width and              

306
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:45,810
height size classes are of the  
calculator in the moment okay.  

307
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,679
And then I just Implemented     
a couple of ViewController      

308
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:51,449
life-cycle methods here,        
viewDidAppear calls it.         

309
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,917
And then,                       
view will transition to size,   

310
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:55,952
which is what happens           
when you rotate.                

311
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,522
And I just call this            
showSizeClasses there.          

312
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,558
I also added a little           
extension to                    

313
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:06,962
UI user interface size          
class to just have it           

314
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,663
implement custom                
string convertible.             

315
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,098
So it implements that           
method description.             

316
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,367
And just returns compact and    
regular.                        

317
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,603
That's so that I can do this    
line of code right here,        

318
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:19,006
where I'm printing              
out the size classes.           

319
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,474
So, it's not really important   
that you understand this.       

320
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,242
You'll just notice              
that when we run it.            

321
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,244
So I'll go ahead and run here.  

322
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,480
You're gonna see that that      
blue thing is gonna get         

323
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,850
taken over to show              
you the size class.             

324
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:35,052
It's just cuz when you're       
running I want you to be clear  

325
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:38,256
on what size classes we're      
doing both horizontally and     

326
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,223
vertically.                     

327
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:46,095
When we are in, and             
this is iPhone 7, So we are in  

328
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:50,267
portrait mode, so you can see   
that our width is compact and   

329
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,401
our height is regular.          

330
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,104
If I rotate, so I'm just        
gonna hit the Cmd key here,     

331
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:58,674
rotate, you can see that now    
we are width compact and        

332
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:02,144
height compact cuz              
we're on the iPhone 7.          

333
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,179
If we were on iPhone 7 Plus,    

334
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,715
right now it would be width     
regular height compact.         

335
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,517
So, in the interest of          
time I won't run there,         

336
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,587
but when we do come to running  
it we'll be able to always see  

337
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,389
what size class we're in.       

338
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:22,427
So, here is our UI right here.  

339
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:25,430
And there's a couple of things  
we can do with size classes     

340
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,499
that are actually really,       
really simple.                  

341
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,668
For example, you can click      
on certain UI elements,         

342
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,671
like a label, and when you go   
to the attribute inspector      

343
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,406
over here you'll notice that    
some of the attributes have     

344
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:37,640
these little pluses.            

345
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,242
See that?                       
Plus, plus?                     

346
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:40,944
And down here, plus and plus?   

347
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,880
And what these                  
pluses let you do,              

348
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,517
is change these fields          
in that size clause.            

349
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:50,885
We can do the any/any.          

350
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,922
We can do compact with          
compact height any,             

351
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:55,889
any combination we want.        

352
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,957
So for example here,            
let's go ahead and              

353
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:02,028
have our background color       
of our display up here          

354
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:06,232
vary depending on our           
height size class.              

355
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,901
If we're height compact,        
we'll do one thing.             

356
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,903
If we're height regular         
we'll do another.               

357
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,671
So, we do that by pressing      
this little plus.               

358
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,506
You see when you do that.       

359
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:17,542
And here we can pick            
the width that we want.         

360
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,244
And since we're varying on      
the height I'm just gonna say   

361
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:21,445
any width.                      

362
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,648
And I'm gonna say height        
compact, so this will,          

363
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,049
means that this background      
that it's gonna,                

364
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,851
this variation                  
it's gonna create,              

365
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,253
will only take effect when      
the height is compact,          

366
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:33,923
if the height is regular, this  
is not going to take effect.    

367
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,725
So, I'm gonna add a variation,  
you see it added it here,       

368
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,126
you see the little hC,          

369
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:42,230
that means height compact all   
right, the width is any, so     

370
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,330
it doesn't say                  
anything about width.           

371
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,632
And now we can change it.       

372
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,766
Let's pick, this is for         
high compact, so                

373
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,467
I'm going to pick cyan.         

374
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:50,302
C for cyan, C for compact,      

375
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,538
hopefully you can               
remember that.                  

376
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,705
So, I've changed that.          

377
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,274
Now, when I changed this,       
notice nothing changed here.    

378
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,709
Why did nothing change there?   

379
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,280
Anyone know?                    

380
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:07,952
It's because we are in          
portrait on an iPhone here.     

381
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,754
iPhone portrait, that is size   
class height regular, see,      

382
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:15,324
down here it will always tell   
you what your size class is or  

383
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:18,628
what you are looking at         
this is height regular.         

384
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,331
So, since height regular        
is not height compact,          

385
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,866
we get the default.             

386
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:28,703
But if I switch over to here,   
landscape, it turned cyan.      

387
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,805
Because now, I'm in             
landscape mode of an iPhone,    

388
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:34,642
which is height compact,        
width compact, as well.         

389
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,512
And if I go to iPhone 7,        
is it gonna be cyan here?       

390
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:45,385
Yes, it is, because in iPhone   
7 Plus, we're regular width,    

391
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:48,054
but we're still                 
compact height,                 

392
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:51,824
so we're still getting          
that cyan there.                

393
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,626
Now, we could add another one,  
for example, right here,        

394
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:57,663
we could go add this one and    
say, what about any width and   

395
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,932
height is regular add           
a variation for that and        

396
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:05,036
go up here maybe we'll pick     
red for regular, and so         

397
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:08,039
now any time the height is      
regular we're gonna see red.    

398
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:12,943
So let's go look at             
potrait>iPhone 7 Plus           

399
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,311
that's clearly regular.         

400
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,613
How about iPad?                 

401
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,582
Red.                            
It's regular.                   

402
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,916
Let's go iPhone.                

403
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,417
Red.                            
Regular height.                 

404
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,786
Let's go landscape.             

405
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,888
Back to compact,                
so we get cyan.                 

406
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,724
So you see how I'm just         
adding these variations.        

407
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,658
And you can do that for         
lots of different things.       

408
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:36,429
For example, when we look       
at this UI on an iPad,          

409
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,065
it doesn't look that good.      

410
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:41,200
Because, look how tiny          
all the fonts are here.         

411
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,103
Maybe we would want to go up    
here and add a variation when   

412
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:48,540
it's regular, regular,          
okay, iPad only,                

413
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,777
where we increase the font on   
the buttons up to 80 or 90.     

414
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:54,279
We could do that.               

415
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,581
That's not always gonna be      
the best way to do things like  

416
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,753
vary your font, but it's        
certainly possible to do that.  

417
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:05,288
Understand all that business?   

418
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:10,026
So, let's talk a little bit of  
how we are going to make this   

419
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:16,333
UI do the five by four or       
the four by five thing here.    

420
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,035
And we know that we             
want to have as much            

421
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:23,939
of the UI as we can that's      
common to both be shared.       

422
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,309
So, what I'm gonna              
do is try to                    

423
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:30,645
work on that shared             
part of the UI here.            

424
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,782
And it doesn't really matter    
what device I'm looking at      

425
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,715
while I'm doing this.           

426
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:35,883
Could be a iPhone Plus,         

427
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,517
could be a regular iPhone,      
doesn't matter,                 

428
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:41,455
because I'm editing stuff that  
applies to all size classes.    

429
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,122
And I'll show you in a moment   
how we're gonna edit stuff      

430
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,924
that applies to                 
a specific size class.          

431
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:46,993
So how I'm gonna do this,       

432
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,562
you saw in the slides           
that really only this           

433
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,898
part right here, these          
bottom 16 are common to all.    

434
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,767
These four across the top       
are either across the top or    

435
00:20:56,836 --> 00:21:00,972
they're off, off to the left    
in a horizontally compact       

436
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,373
situation.                      

437
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,176
I'm gonna kind of have to       
unbundle all these things, so   

438
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:10,280
let's start by just selecting   
this top level StackView and    

439
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,983
unstackviewifying it.           

440
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,152
Take everything out of          
the StackView because clearly   

441
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,754
these things can't be           
inside that StackView.          

442
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:20,889
And one thing to understand     
when you're doing these         

443
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,592
size classes,                   
you can have views come and     

444
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:26,161
go based on size classes, but   
you can't have them come and    

445
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:28,263
go inside StackViews.           

446
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:31,465
It doesn't know how to put      
a view in inside another view.  

447
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:35,369
It has to be kind of a top      
level, coming and going, or     

448
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,904
inclusion or not inclusion.     

449
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,606
So, how do we undo              
a stack view?                   

450
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,507
Actually you can just           
go to editor up here,           

451
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:43,943
the same place that we          
said embed in stack view,       

452
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,279
you can actually do unembed     
and that will take everything   

453
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,816
out of stack view,              
back to where we were before.   

454
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,617
The other thing I'm gonna       
do is I'm gonna get rid of      

455
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,953
all the constraints on here,    
cuz I had these constraints     

456
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,821
that were holding this to       
the edge, but they just don't   

457
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,790
make any sense anymore          
cuz I've unbundled this.        

458
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:00,891
So, how can I do that?          

459
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,292
Right down here in the lower    
corner where it says resolve    

460
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,528
auto layout issues.             

461
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:06,428
You can go down here and        

462
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,296
for all views in                
the view controller,            

463
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,031
you can say clear constraints.  

464
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,998
So that's what                  
I'm gonna go and                

465
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,601
it's gonna wipe out all         
the constraints in this         

466
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,135
view controller.                

467
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,836
Clear them all out.             

468
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:21,041
So now that I don't have        
the constraints in here,        

469
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,809
I can move this staff           
around and kind of put          

470
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,378
new constraints that I want on  
here and we can see that our    

471
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,881
constraints are cleared         
because if I select something   

472
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:32,384
like this top label and I go    
to size inspector over here,    

473
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,819
there's no constraint           
at the bottom.                  

474
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:38,890
So let's go ahead and           
move this out of the way.       

475
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,726
Let's put this back             
tied to the top and             

476
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,595
left and right in exactly       
the same way as we did before.  

477
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,496
So to kind of review,           

478
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,265
I'm just gonna control          
drag to the top notch.          

479
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,732
I'm gonna do something          
interesting.                    

480
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,602
I'm gonna Ctrl+Drag kinda       
up to the corner up here.       

481
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,972
When I do that, I can           
actually do both leading and    

482
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,872
vertical space.                 

483
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,341
And what I'm doing              
here to make,                   

484
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,843
to pick more than one           
constraint, is Shift.           

485
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,279
So, if you do Shift, you can    
pick more than one thing.       

486
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,948
So here, I want both            
the leading edge on the left    

487
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,282
there, and the top edge,        

488
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:13,052
the vertical space to be tied,  
to be constrained.              

489
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,588
So, I just pick all the ones    
I want and then I click         

490
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:18,690
add constraints right here,     
and it adds those two.          

491
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,926
And same thing, I can do        
this one over here then.        

492
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,694
That's the trailing one.        

493
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:26,231
So now, when we look            
at our label up there,          

494
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,331
it's got these constraints.     

495
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,000
That's good,                    
that's what we want.            

496
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,435
Now, what about this            
bottom constraint?              

497
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,971
Well, it use to be that         
the bottom of this was tied to  

498
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,872
the top of this, and            

499
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,973
then the bottom of this was     
tied to the bottom of this.     

500
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,075
But we can't do that anymore.   

501
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:44,947
Because in five high            
by four wide, this is           

502
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:48,450
gonna be on the top, but        
in four high and five wide,     

503
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,953
these are gonna be over here    
and this is gonna be the top.   

504
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:56,123
So that's something we can't    
do in the any/any mode.         

505
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:57,591
We just can't do it.            

506
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,826
But we can take this            
stack down view and             

507
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:02,395
put it down in this             
corner over here.               

508
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:07,467
And use our same control drags  

509
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:13,539
to do the trailing              
space there, and                

510
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:18,610
the control drag to the bottom  

511
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,115
to do the vertical space.       

512
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:25,817
So I've tied this               
thing to the bottom.            

513
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,053
So this actually works,         
in quotes,                      

514
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:32,490
it works in both modes.         

515
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,192
Keeps them both on screen it's  
doing what I said keeping       

516
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:36,726
the display at the top and      

517
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:38,428
keeping this stuff              
in the lower right.             

518
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:42,431
But it's clearly insufficient   
to do what we want in the two   

519
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,367
So, in the two cases, it's      
this stack view right here,     

520
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,235
different cases.                

521
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,170
let me zoom in a little.        

522
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:52,073
This stack view right here      
is the one that's at issue.     

523
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,708
So I'm just gonna               
take this thing and             

524
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:56,444
lift it up out of the stack     
view, which you can do,         

525
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,111
you can lift things up and      
out.                            

526
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,147
So I lift it out and drop it,   
and it's sitting there.         

527
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:05,853
Now it doesn't want to be in    
the any, any case at all.       

528
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,554
It wants to only be in          
certain size classes.           

529
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,224
So, I'm going to take it and    
cut it, because I'm gonna       

530
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:15,561
paste it back in when we        
get to other size classes.      

531
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,197
So this is our                  
any/any right here.             

532
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:21,233
This is the best we can do in   
terms of common UI to both      

533
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:25,504
the compact vertical case, and  
the regular vertical case.      

534
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:31,142
Now let's go on and             
do the compact case let's say.  

535
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:33,344
Let's do the UI                 
that's compact.                 

536
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:36,780
Now since all the work that     
we're going to be doing right   

537
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:40,784
now is only for the compact     
case we depress this super      

538
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:44,054
important button right here,    
vary for traits.                

539
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,523
This, this is what it's all     
about when it comes to doing    

540
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,325
the size class variations.      

541
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:53,395
So first you're gonna pick      
something that has the height   

542
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:56,631
or width class or               
both that you want to vary.     

543
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,633
So here I wanna do              
the horizontally or             

544
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:02,103
the height compact, see height  
compact, I wanna do that one.   

545
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,105
So this is a pretty good        
one to work in, but             

546
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:06,907
I can pick any of the ones      
that are height compact.        

547
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:09,076
And I'm gonna say vary for      
traits.                         

548
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:13,145
And I'm gonna vary in           
the height direction.           

549
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:15,882
Notice that that bar at         
the bottom turned bright blue.  

550
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,351
That's to warn you,             
" watch out here                

551
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,688
now because you are editing     
UI only for height compact".    

552
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,223
And it's even showing           
you all devices that            

553
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,191
are height compact.             

554
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,362
Which is all the iPhones,       
including the pluses.           

555
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,330
They're all in landscape,       
they're all height compact,     

556
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,465
and those are the only ones.    

557
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,166
So all the editing we're doing  
now is only going to have       

558
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,936
effect on these devices until   
we stop making this thing blue  

559
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,872
by pressing done varying.       

560
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:47,909
So, building this UI now        
we can, here's the two          

561
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:50,512
big things you can do when      
in the blue mode here.          

562
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:54,716
One is you can add views or     
remove views actually, and      

563
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:57,518
the other you can               
add constraints.                

564
00:26:57,587 --> 00:26:59,420
So, that's exactly              
what I wanna do here,           

565
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,288
I wanna put those four          
buttons over here.              

566
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:03,323
And then we wanna do some       
constraints to make those       

567
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,024
buttons be in the right place.  

568
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:08,595
So let's start by adding these  
back, remember I cut them so    

569
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:10,229
I'm just gonna paste.           

570
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,130
Here it is, here's that         
stack view that had them.       

571
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,399
It used to be inside this       
stack view at the top.          

572
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,502
Now we wanna kinda              
put it on this side.            

573
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,103
And when I put it on this       
side I want it to like          

574
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,072
seem like it's inside           
the stack view,                 

575
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,774
but I can't actually put        
it inside the stack view.       

576
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,209
Cuz like I said,                
this variation for              

577
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,511
traits cannot put things        
inside stock views.             

578
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,145
But it's a great                
opportunity for                 

579
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:32,781
me to show you other auto       
layout constraints that can     

580
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,650
make it seem like it's          
in that stack view.             

581
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,919
And basically do the same       
thing that the stock view is    

582
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,789
doing internally which is just  
adding auto layout constraints  

583
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,457
to make things work.            

584
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,860
Now the first thing we want is  
we want these buttons to be     

585
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:47,060
vertical.                       

586
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,162
We want them up and down and    
that's simple to do.            

587
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,096
We have this selected,          

588
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:52,398
I'm just gonna go to            
the attributes inspector and    

589
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,934
change the stack                
view to be vertical.            

590
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,568
So it's switching               
over to vertical,               

591
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,069
that's a really good start.     

592
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,707
I could drag this up next to    
it and use the blue lines.      

593
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,109
That's nice, although the blue  
lines are probably not gonna    

594
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:06,710
get it right here.              

595
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,379
If you notice when I drop       
that blue line down, look,      

596
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:11,714
it's trying to do               
all kinds of things.            

597
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:15,185
Centering here, stuff like      
that along the bottom.          

598
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:18,654
No, so I'm gonna do all my      
constraints here to make        

599
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:22,858
this hook up, I'm gonna         
do them all manually.           

600
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,628
Also it's a good chance to      
show you how to do them all.    

601
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,897
So what, how are we gonna make  
this vertical piece right       

602
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,899
here, this vertical             
stack view,                     

603
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:34,569
look like it's a part of        
this other stack view?          

604
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:37,104
One thing we want to do is we   
clearly want the height of      

605
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,706
this stack view to always       
be tracking the height of       

606
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:41,074
the other one.                  

607
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:43,976
We want the top and bottom      
edges, basically, of this       

608
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:47,213
stack view and of this stack    
view to always be pinned.       

609
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:50,015
Well that sounds, pinning,      
sounds like a constraint.       

610
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,818
We wanna constrain them,        
so, how can we do that?         

611
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,620
Here's how we do it,            
we're gonna select them both.   

612
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,489
A good way to select things,    
by the way, is dragging.        

613
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,625
Dragging is a great             
way to select things.           

614
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,393
So I'm gonna select both        
of them right here.             

615
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:05,529
And then I'm gonna use          
this menu down here.            

616
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:08,432
Which is called the align       
menu, and that's exactly what   

617
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,099
I wanna do,                     
I wanna align these things.     

618
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,869
I click on it, and you can see  
that I can align things like    

619
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:16,339
the centers or                  
even the text base lines.       

620
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,540
But what I want here is         
that I wanna align the top      

621
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:19,308
and bottom.                     

622
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:21,409
So I'm gonna click top and      
bottom.                         

623
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:23,878
These numbers over here         
by the way are an offset.       

624
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,613
So if you wanted it             
to align the tops but           

625
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,148
you want one to be ten higher,  
you can put a ten in here.      

626
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,016
But I want them be              
right along the top.            

627
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,952
I wanna have the constraint     
where this is                   

628
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,954
exactly the same, this is       
exactly the same at all times.  

629
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,222
So I pick whichevers            
I want and                      

630
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,191
just say, add constraints and   
I added them.                   

631
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,325
Now, woah,                      

632
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:44,429
it turn red, why am I getting   
those red lines right there?    

633
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:47,398
Now, you can always             
find out about your             

634
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,134
problems that you have with     
constraints by clicking on      

635
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,802
this little thing               
right up here.                  

636
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,604
You see this yellow guy,        
click on him and it says,       

637
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,974
the horizontal position is      
ambiguous for stack view.       

638
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,242
Well, I've got multiple         
stack views, so                 

639
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:02,177
which one's it talking about.   

640
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,412
This is kind of a bummer.       

641
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,048
This is really just             
an overview of the errors.      

642
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,783
Usually we don't look here.     

643
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:11,152
The place we look is in         
the document outline okay.      

644
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,389
The document outline            
here which I have shown.        

645
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,191
I can hide it and show it.      

646
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,358
This is the place where for     

647
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,560
example we had to wire up       
to the refresh control.         

648
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,628
This is the place we go         
when it's hard to click on      

649
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,597
something, cuz we can just      
click on a view here.           

650
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:27,566
This is also the place we       
go to deal with all auto        

651
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,000
layout problems.                

652
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,270
And the magic place to look is  
this upper corner right here.   

653
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,405
You see that red right there?   

654
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:37,274
This red is saying that         
there is either a lack          

655
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,242
of constraints or               
conflicting constraints.        

656
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,878
In other words, there are       
constraint problems that are    

657
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:44,780
so bad that your app is not     
going to work when you run.     

658
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,518
So we can click on this red     
thing and it will show us       

659
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,487
all the details of all          
the constraint problems.        

660
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,422
So now when we                  
mouse over this,                

661
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,924
it still says need              
constraints for x position.     

662
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:59,260
But we can find out which       
stack view it's talking about.  

663
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,495
And of course,                  
it's talking about that one.    

664
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:02,964
This other stack                
view over here,                 

665
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:07,167
it has an x position,           
it's tied to the left edge.     

666
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,636
But this one is not             
tied to anything.               

667
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,504
It's top and                    
bottom are tied but             

668
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,574
it could be sliding             
horizontally any which way.     

669
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:15,874
So that's not tied, so          

670
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,978
we don't know where it's        
exposition is supposed to be.   

671
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,145
We need to fix that.            

672
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,880
How are we gonna fix that?      

673
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,817
Well probably the best way to   
do that is to hook it up to     

674
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,952
the edge of this stack view.    

675
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,256
Cuz if it, we tie this edge     
right here to this stack view,  

676
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,958
then it'll, its horizontal      
position will be set because    

677
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,460
it'll be tied to this           
guy's horizontal position.      

678
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,896
So how do we hook               
this guy up to here?            

679
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,932
Well we could of course         
control drag, all right, but    

680
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:48,036
I'm gonna use this opportunity  
to show you a different way to  

681
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,587
Which is I selected it and I'm  
going down to this other menu   

682
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,070
hook it up.                     

683
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,007
down here, this one that says   
add new constraints, and        

684
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:55,142
I'm clicking on it.             

685
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,778
And we've actually seen         
this one briefly, I think.      

686
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:01,547
But here you can do things      
like make things to be          

687
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,049
affixed with.                   

688
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:06,886
Or you can set the distance     
from your nearest neighbor.     

689
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:07,720
That's what these are.          

690
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,287
These are the distance          
to the nearest neighbor.        

691
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,824
Now these little red I-beams    
are all grayed out right here   

692
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:14,792
or transparency'd out.          

693
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:15,960
So right now,                   

694
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:19,729
this guy is not hooked up to    
his nearest neighbor at all.    

695
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,366
But we clearly wanna hook him   
up to his nearest neighbor on   

696
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:23,933
the right, that's this one.     

697
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,703
So, I'm gonna click this        
I-beam,it turns it on and now,  

698
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:31,541
he's clamped to his nearest     
neighbor on the right and       

699
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,542
he's eight pixels away          
because that's what the dash    

700
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,845
blue lines put, but             
we dont want that,              

701
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,548
we want ten pixels away,        
so we're gonna put ten.         

702
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:44,752
We have 10 pixels away clamped  
to the nearest neighbor.        

703
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,054
Let's add that                  
constraint as well.             

704
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:50,090
Our red went away but           
now we have yellow.             

705
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,725
What does yellow                
mean in auto layout?            

706
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:55,227
Yellow means,                   
"your constraints are okay and  

707
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,629
when you run it's               
probably gonna work, but        

708
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:01,066
what you're looking at in       
your storyboard is not          

709
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:03,502
what your constraints           
are saying".                    

710
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:07,572
Your constraints are not        
equal to what you see here.     

711
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,708
You can see right here, for     
example, it's expecting         

712
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:13,378
the X position of this stack    
view that's highlighted right   

713
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:16,547
here to be at 385, but          
it's actually at 387.           

714
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:20,316
And if we zoom way in,          
in fact, with option.           

715
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:22,185
There's a option zooming here.  

716
00:33:22,254 --> 00:33:24,387
You can see there's             
a dashed yellow line.           

717
00:33:24,455 --> 00:33:25,321
I don't know if                 
you can see that.               

718
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,955
Yeah, you can see that.         

719
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:29,358
This dashed yellow line,        
that's where the constraint     

720
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,926
system thinks this              
Stack View should be.           

721
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:35,062
The solid yellow line is        
where it actually is.           

722
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:39,399
And even the i-beam between     
the two has a little -2         

723
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,169
right there, saying yeah,       
I got this i-beam here, but     

724
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:46,173
it seems like it should be      
2 points over to the left.      

725
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,208
How do we fix this.             

726
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,343
When we have these yellow       
problems how do we              

727
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,713
get things to be put in         
the right place or something.   

728
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,715
And the answer is we're gonna   
go over to our document         

729
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,649
outline.                        

730
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,783
By the way we can get here      
with the same way we got        

731
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:02,620
to the red by clicking in this  
upper corner with the yellow.   

732
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:05,990
And we're gonna click on this   
triangle cuz that's gonna,      

733
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,924
the string will let you         
resolve the problem.            

734
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:10,627
So, I click on it and           
actually have some choices      

735
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:14,230
how to resolve that problem,    
one is I can update the frame,  

736
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:17,800
that means move the views       
to match the constrains,        

737
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,035
which is definitely what        
I want in this case.            

738
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:23,071
Because I do want it to be 10   
pixels apart there not eight.   

739
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,639
But I could also do             
other things like               

740
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,407
updating the constraints.       

741
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:30,778
And that would go and           

742
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:34,181
Even thought I typed 10, this   
would clamp it back to 8, so    

743
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,517
that it would match             
what's going on here.           

744
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:39,119
Or you can do the dreaded       
reset to suggested              

745
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:40,220
constraints.                    

746
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,722
Which probably also             
would at least do that,         

747
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,957
probably do some other          
things we don't want.           

748
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:47,692
In other words it kinda try     
do what the blue line said.     

749
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:51,028
Reset to suggest                
the constraints we rarely use.  

750
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:52,463
It's only good for when you're  

751
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,365
like dragging something         
right into the middle or        

752
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,467
right out to the edges          
those kind of things.           

753
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,069
It's not super good             
guessing what you want          

754
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:00,937
in other scenarios.             

755
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,708
Now, this update frames,        
I can apply it just to          

756
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,310
this view right here that's     
having the problem or           

757
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:12,213
I can apply it to all the       
views in my entire controller.  

758
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,082
And whether you have            
this switched or not,           

759
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,018
it's about 50/50 when we        
switch this is whether you      

760
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,487
have other views that you're    
in the middle of working on.    

761
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,490
That you haven't quite fully    
specified their constraints.    

762
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,290
Then you'd probably             
don't want apply to all,        

763
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,192
because it's going to           
try to move them and            

764
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,528
you haven't finished            
specifying them.                

765
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,595
But in this case,               

766
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:33,899
this is the only view that has  
any misplaced views, you see.   

767
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,967
So, I can go ahead and          
say all or not.                 

768
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,035
It's not going to               
make a difference,              

769
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,603
because this is the only        
one that is going to move.      

770
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,004
I'm just going to               
leave it at all.                

771
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,571
And I'm gonna say Fix.          

772
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,973
And you're gonna see            
that it moved it.               

773
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,441
Moved it two pixels over here.  

774
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,643
If we zoom in again here,       

775
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:52,414
we'll see now that this is      
tan, just like this is ten.     

776
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,066
And it also says No Autolayout  
issues over here.               

777
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,650
It moved it.                    

778
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,253
If we go back here,             
there's nothing in the corner.  

779
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,720
All is well.                    

780
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,822
We're in good                   
shape right there.              

781
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:04,758
Now, there's one other          
problem with this,              

782
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:09,062
look how narrow these buttons   
are compared to these buttons.  

783
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,931
We want these buttons to        
be exactly the same width       

784
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,966
as all of these buttons.        

785
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:16,135
Now since it's not in the same  
stack view it's not getting     

786
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,038
the fill equally and so         
it's not getting that.          

787
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,807
So, how can I make these        
buttons inside this             

788
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:24,442
stack view right here be        
exactly the same width          

789
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:25,610
as the buttons over here.       

790
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,981
Well, I'm going to              
just control drag.              

791
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,783
Actually, I'm gonna control     
drag from the entire            

792
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:33,783
stack view.                     

793
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:35,552
See I'm dragging                
from the stack view.            

794
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,520
To any button over here and     
just say                        

795
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,757
that I want it to be the same   
width as any button over here.  

796
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,392
So, we'll just                  
pick this one and               

797
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:45,160
here's all the things           
we can choose and               

798
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,594
then I'm gonna go down          
here to the bottom and          

799
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,463
pick Equal Widths               
okay cuz I want those           

800
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:50,831
buttons to be the same width.   

801
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,766
And I'm gonna add               
that constraint and             

802
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,767
it applies the constraint.      

803
00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:55,935
And you can even see this       
constraint right there.         

804
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:56,936
Again, I'll zoom in.            

805
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,939
You can see the constraints     
right here.                     

806
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:00,839
This equals and                 

807
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:03,275
this equals are saying          
those two things are equal.     

808
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:07,712
So we're almost there.          

809
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,148
We've got these four            
buttons that we've added        

810
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,684
looking like they're in the     
stack view by putting our own   

811
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:14,817
constraints on there.           

812
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,519
The only thing that's left is,  

813
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:18,521
we're not using                 
the whole space.                

814
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,988
We're not connected             
to the whole space.             

815
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:22,457
Now here, we can do exactly     
what we did before,             

816
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:25,726
I'm just gonna select this      
StackView right here.           

817
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,128
Not this one, but               
just this one.                  

818
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,663
I'm gonna Ctrl drag             
up to here and                  

819
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:32,098
I'm gonna set its               
vertical spacing.               

820
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,501
Put's this I-beam               
in here to the top.             

821
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,035
Now when I double-click on it.  

822
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,871
Well also by the way, you know  
that we can click on these and  

823
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,640
inspect them, remember that,    
so it's showing that this       

824
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,345
I-beam connects the stack       
views top to the displays       

825
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:51,416
button and it sets them to be   
equal with an offset of 57.     

826
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,084
That's what this constant is.   

827
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,752
It's an offset of 57.           

828
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,721
So that's why we're             
getting this 57 high bar.       

829
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,556
And we don't want that.         

830
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,392
We want to change that          
to be standard value.           

831
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,925
Actually, we don't even         
want standard value,            

832
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:06,496
we probably want 10 because we  
probably want this distance to  

833
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,565
be the same as the distance     
between all of our buttons.     

834
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:10,833
I'm not sure which              
one we want but                 

835
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,935
I think that one's              
probably pretty good.           

836
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,571
So that's good now notice as    
soon as constrained the top of  

837
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,141
this stack view to go up here   
it automatically dragged        

838
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,576
this stack view's               
top up there.                   

839
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,077
That's because we               
have a constrained              

840
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:26,713
that hooks the tops             
of these together.              

841
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:29,182
If I click on here,             
I look in the size inspector,   

842
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,551
you can see that I've got       
a line top to this top and      

843
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,153
bottom to this                  
other stack view.               

844
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:35,587
Do you see that?                

845
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:36,187
So that's good.                 

846
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:37,155
What about this edge?           

847
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:40,091
Same thing here, we can just    
take this stack view and        

848
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,726
hook it to edge, this leading   
space to contain a margin,      

849
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,861
just like we did before, and    

850
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:48,698
here we get this, obviously     
we can inspect it over here.    

851
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:52,034
We can also double click        
on it to inspect it, which      

852
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:54,870
we saw before, and here I've    
picked standard value, there's  

853
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:57,639
no standard value available,    
so I'm just gonna do zero and   

854
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,941
it's gonna zoom                 
that think over.                

855
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:02,377
That's it.                      

856
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,311
So we've done everything        
we need to do no for            

857
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,914
this height-compact situation.  

858
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:08,882
And so,                         

859
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:10,983
this is a very important        
thing to remember to do.        

860
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:14,653
When you're done,               
click Done varying down here.   

861
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:15,721
Because a lot of                
times you'll do this,           

862
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,055
and you're like all             
right it's working.             

863
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:19,691
And then, you'll go on to work  
on some other sized class, and  

864
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,526
you'll forgot to have           
clicked this off.               

865
00:39:21,595 --> 00:39:25,063
And now, you'll be editing      
only in the height-compact.     

866
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,497
So, we're gonna                 
hit Done varying.               

867
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,098
Get's rid of our blue.          

868
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,432
And we, so                      
we know we're in good shape.    

869
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,735
Now what happens if I           
go back to portrait?            

870
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,536
What's this gonna look          
like in portrait?               

871
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,504
Anyone wanna volunteer?         

872
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,541
Yes, so all of this             
work that we did here           

873
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,177
has had no effect               
whatsoever on portrait.         

874
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:44,845
Because portrait                
is height regular.              

875
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,481
And all that work we did here,  
every single bit we did since   

876
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,451
we clicked into the blue bar,   
only happens in high compact.   

877
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,188
So when we click back to        
portrait it looks just like it  

878
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:59,625
used to, unaffected by          
all that work we did.           

879
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:02,062
Make sense,                     
understand why that happened?   

880
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:09,001
So now, we need to, in this     
case, the height regular case,  

881
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,903
we need to put those buttons    
in along the top here.          

882
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,872
So, I'm gonna do this           
pretty quickly, so              

883
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,441
you can kind of see             
a review of it.                 

884
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,008
Actually, before                
I do that review,               

885
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:19,243
let's let this soak             
in a little bit,                

886
00:40:19,312 --> 00:40:21,645
because I wanna show you        
the document outline.           

887
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,446
So, I'm going over              
the document outline and        

888
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,181
I'm just gonna make it wider.   

889
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,215
And why do you wanna            
make this wider?                

890
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:30,452
Well, the document outline      
shows not only all your views,  

891
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,989
but it also show all            
of your constraints.            

892
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,825
You see all these               
constraints down here?          

893
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,893
And you notice that             
some of them are, like,         

894
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:41,529
grayed out here.                

895
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:42,797
And why are they grayed out?    

896
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:46,332
Because they apply to           
a different size class          

897
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,968
than is being shown here.       

898
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:51,971
We are looking at height        
regular, these grayed out       

899
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,075
constraints are only over       
here in height compact.         

900
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,476
So, when we go to               
height compact,                 

901
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:00,678
all of them apply because       
we haven't done any             

902
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:03,415
constraints that are in         
height regular only yet.        

903
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:06,851
So, all of these apply          
in that circumstance.           

904
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,420
Now, looking at                 
your constraints                

905
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,489
right here is a really          
good kind of tool for           

906
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:15,792
finding tiny little             
problems with your UI.          

907
00:41:15,861 --> 00:41:17,861
And that's when you             
have magic numbers.             

908
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:20,029
You see this magic              
numbers in here?                

909
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:22,265
8 8 20 10 and 10.               

910
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,566
By the way, we never wanna      
look at the magic numbers for   

911
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:25,601
things that are grade out.      

912
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:28,102
Like this 347 when I            
look at that because it         

913
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:30,671
doesn't apply here.             

914
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,142
We only wanna look at the ones  
that are dark blue here.        

915
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,445
So we don't like to see         
these magic numbers here,       

916
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:41,748
unless we intend for            
that magic number to be there.  

917
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:45,751
So, 8 8 20,                     
we never typed those in.        

918
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,652
Why are they there?             

919
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,521
We don't want them there.       

920
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,656
10 and                          
10 however we do want those.    

921
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:51,489
We wanted those,                

922
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,891
those are a magic number        
we want in our UI.              

923
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,794
That's our spacing in between   
that we decided we want.        

924
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:59,864
So, how to we get rid of these  
magic numbers, like 8, 8, 20?   

925
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:02,967
Well, you're gonna click        
on them to select it.           

926
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:05,202
This is just like if you        
had clicked on it in here,      

927
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,003
cuz the document outline,       
you remember, you click there.  

928
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:09,905
It's just like you're clicking  
in, in here, except for         

929
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:13,041
sometimes it's even easier to   
click on the document outline.  

930
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,612
We could also click on the      
thing that it's attached to     

931
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,879
like the display.               

932
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:20,582
So, this is the display's       
top equals top layout           

933
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:21,583
guide plus eight.               

934
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,817
And go to the size              
inspector here and see it.      

935
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,986
And we'll see the magic         
numbers here also,              

936
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:27,154
not just in                     
the document outline.           

937
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:31,625
But, we're seeing them here     
in our size inspector.          

938
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:34,193
So, any time we see these       
magic numbers we want to        

939
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:34,960
inspect them,                   

940
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:38,997
either here or by clicking      
on them and edit them.          

941
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:40,198
So, in the size inspector       

942
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,167
we've always gone in to check   
to make sure things are good,   

943
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:45,503
but we can also change          
them if they're not good.       

944
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:47,938
And so, here I'm clicking       
on it and editing it, and       

945
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:49,840
this constant, I don't          
want it to be eight, so         

946
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:52,176
let's see what my choices are.  

947
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:55,745
I don't have standard value,    
use canvas value means          

948
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:58,547
use what's currently            
showing in the story board,     

949
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:00,116
we rarely want that.            

950
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,217
It's almost never want that,    

951
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:03,985
that would mean that we had     
to have dragged it right in     

952
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,520
position they will              
use the blue lines.             

953
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:06,854
It might be right but,          

954
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:09,390
almost never do you             
want the canvas value.          

955
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:12,459
Instead, we're gonna            
do what we do here,             

956
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:16,897
to say what we want, so maybe,  
this one, actually I'm gonna    

957
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:21,635
do this one down here first,    
let's look at this one.         

958
00:43:21,703 --> 00:43:24,170
So this top layout guide here,  
this one, we can use            

959
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:28,241
a standard value, to do it      
to the top layout guide.        

960
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:30,108
And look,                       
I did standard value and        

961
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,409
it got rid of the plus eight.   

962
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:34,045
It's still eight pixel, eight   
points over there because that  

963
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:37,147
is the standard value but       
it stopped showing it as that.  

964
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:40,184
And same thing up here when we  
go up to this one and we look,  

965
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:43,387
there's no standard value       
here so what do we put, 0.      

966
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,921
And we will have zero.          

967
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,623
That actually fixed a bug       
because it move this display    

968
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,258
right up to the edge            
right there.                    

969
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:52,761
And you can see that            
got rid of that one.            

970
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,129
Same thing here,                
we can go to this one.          

971
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,131
Let's do this one               
by inspecting it.               

972
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,766
Here's the constant right       
here, 20, we don't want that.   

973
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,069
We go here and say,             
standard value.                 

974
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,670
What's the standard value and   
the 20 is gone,                 

975
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:04,004
that also fixed a bug           

976
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:05,872
cuz the thing was not all       
the way down at the bottom.     

977
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:08,007
So, you see how we              
fixed bugs by going and         

978
00:44:08,076 --> 00:44:12,211
chasing down all of our         
magic numbers in this view,     

979
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,745
okay in the document outline.   

980
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:16,848
So, you almost always want to   
be chasing those things down.   

981
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:19,885
The only problem can happen     
here when you're chasing them   

982
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:21,919
is when you have a magic        
number like 8 or                

983
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:24,322
20 that you actually            
intend to be 8 or 20.           

984
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,457
Cuz then you're like is         
that a magic wand or not?       

985
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:28,858
Because there's no way to       
down like a variable in         

986
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,160
there or something.             

987
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:31,928
But these tens,                 
we know those are right.        

988
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:35,297
All right, so,                  

989
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:38,033
just a little side track there  
to show you how to use that.    

990
00:44:38,102 --> 00:44:40,702
Let's go back to our            
height regular and              

991
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,171
make this look                  
like what we want.              

992
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,108
So, let's start by pasting      
back in these things.           

993
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:48,009
Actually, before we do that.    

994
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:50,110
And this is a common            
mistake you'll make to.         

995
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:52,379
What mistake did I              
make right there?               

996
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:53,813
I wanted to start doing         
height regular and              

997
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:54,914
I didn't hit vary for           
traits, so                      

998
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,482
I wasn't acctually              
editing height regular,         

999
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,349
I was editing any/any.          

1000
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:00,919
So, don't miss that,            
so I'm gonna vary for           

1001
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:02,620
traits in heights and           

1002
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:07,024
this gonna use this height      
were I'm looking at, height     

1003
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:11,729
regular this gonna show me all  
gonna show me all devices with  

1004
00:45:11,797 --> 00:45:15,866
height regular which is         
all the iPads, Split View,      

1005
00:45:15,935 --> 00:45:20,570
Masters, all the iPhone,        
they're all height regulars.    

1006
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:21,438
So it's just showing me and     

1007
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:24,040
I can actually do this          
editing in anyone of those.     

1008
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:24,973
Because they're all             
height regular.                 

1009
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:28,077
All right, so                   
now let's paste this in.        

1010
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:29,577
Now, when I pasted this in,     

1011
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,746
by the way an interesting       
thing happened.                 

1012
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,315
If I go to my attributes        
inspector and                   

1013
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:35,950
go all the way to the bottom.   

1014
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,051
Look right here.                

1015
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,654
Okay, I selected this           
stake view right here.          

1016
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:43,657
And you see that it             
says installed not.             

1017
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,492
But, in height regular          
it's installed.                 

1018
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:50,362
That's saying this stack view   
only is installed in the view   

1019
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,429
hierarchy.                      

1020
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,564
When we're height regular.      

1021
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:55,767
If I click on this one notice   
it's installed everywhere.      

1022
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,703
Doesn't say not installed and   
height regular.                 

1023
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:01,771
It says installed everywhere.   

1024
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,172
So, you can always              
tell which user and             

1025
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:04,741
you can of course click         
these on and off.               

1026
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:07,477
And you can even add a plus     
here to add variation           

1027
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:08,410
to remove them.                 

1028
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,646
I find it easier just to        
Enter this varying mode and     

1029
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:13,148
then drag these things in.      

1030
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:15,349
Anyway, here we go.             

1031
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:17,885
Let's get this                  
thing down here.                

1032
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:21,788
Again, we want the both         
edges to be lined up.           

1033
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:23,056
So, let's go ahead and          

1034
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,993
do that remember we do that     
by selecting them both.         

1035
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:28,827
And in going over               
here to a line.                 

1036
00:46:28,896 --> 00:46:30,429
This time it's the leading and  

1037
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:33,031
trailing edges that we          
want to be the same.            

1038
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,033
And add those constraints.      

1039
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:37,701
Again, as soon as I had         
those constraints now I have    

1040
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,606
a problem with a vertical       
position of this stack view,    

1041
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,540
is not defined.                 

1042
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:45,308
You need constraints for        
the Y position.                 

1043
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:48,411
Cuz, I've only constrained      
it horizontally right there.    

1044
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,881
So, let's go ahead and          
constrain it for                

1045
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:53,415
a vertical by                   
pinning it to this.             

1046
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,518
So, I'm gonna use this other    
one over here this time.        

1047
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,986
And I'm gonna show you          
something interesting here.     

1048
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:01,923
So, here I'm gonna pin to its   
bottom nearest neighbor, and    

1049
00:47:01,991 --> 00:47:05,459
I'm gonna use ten, which is     
my magic number that I want.    

1050
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:08,830
And I'm gonna pick something    
in here cuz remember last time  

1051
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:09,630
we did this and                 

1052
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:13,199
when I put this in here it      
turned from red to yellow.      

1053
00:47:13,268 --> 00:47:15,602
Because things weren't in the   
right position cuz I had added  

1054
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:17,336
constraints and                 
it didn't move them.            

1055
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:21,106
Well, if you go down here and   
say update frames either to     

1056
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,774
the items of the new            
constraints,                    

1057
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,976
involved in the new             
constraints which would be.     

1058
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,011
This nearest neighbor and       
us, or                          

1059
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,813
you can do it all the frames    
in your container.              

1060
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,181
If you turn this on, then when  
you add this constraints,       

1061
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,583
it will automatically           
move them.                      

1062
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:34,918
And then,                       
you won't get the yellow.       

1063
00:47:34,987 --> 00:47:36,453
You won't have to go over and   

1064
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,621
click, update frames and        
all that.                       

1065
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,858
So watch this, when I add this  
constraint, it moved them.      

1066
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:43,959
You see that?                   

1067
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,259
No yellow.                      

1068
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:45,960
Right here.                     
I am in                         

1069
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:48,162
my document outline nothing     
on in the upper corner          

1070
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:50,964
like there was when             
we did the other one.           

1071
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,433
Now, we still have one          
other things to do here.        

1072
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:56,670
It's not obvious that           
we need to do this but          

1073
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:59,338
the height of these just        
happens to to be the same       

1074
00:47:59,407 --> 00:48:01,006
height as all of these.         

1075
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:03,308
But that's just                 
happy circumstance.             

1076
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,243
And the other time it was       
obvious that they weren't.      

1077
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:08,379
So I need to do the same thing  
here where I'm gonna control,   

1078
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:09,814
drag from this stack view.      

1079
00:48:09,882 --> 00:48:12,683
And then again I could do       
either an individual button or  

1080
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:15,185
one of these sub stack          
views right here.               

1081
00:48:15,254 --> 00:48:17,520
And I'm gonna set them          
to be equal heights.            

1082
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:20,924
Other was, just so              
that no matter what             

1083
00:48:20,993 --> 00:48:23,793
mathematical symbol I put       
in those buttons up there       

1084
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,662
then it's never gonna           
squinch down and be smaller.    

1085
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,866
Or grow up and                  
be bigger than the other ones.  

1086
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:32,468
So I'm gonna say equal          
height right there.             

1087
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:36,571
See the two equals that         
got generated there?            

1088
00:48:37,974 --> 00:48:39,340
So same thing as before.        

1089
00:48:39,408 --> 00:48:41,442
We've done a good job           
of adding this on and           

1090
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,144
making it seem like this        
is part of the stack view.      

1091
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:48,648
So this time we're going to     
attach this stack view up to    

1092
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,815
here.                           

1093
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:52,551
So I'm just gonna               
control drag up to here,        

1094
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,320
set the vertical spacing, and   
I'm gonna put the edge of this  

1095
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:58,057
big stack view right            
here over to the edge.          

1096
00:48:59,926 --> 00:49:03,027
And same thing as always we     
want to double click here.      

1097
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:04,094
Standard if we can.             

1098
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:06,663
We can't, we'll do zero.        

1099
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:09,199
Same thing with                 
this one over here.             

1100
00:49:09,268 --> 00:49:10,233
Double click.                   

1101
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:13,236
Here we want our                
magic number of ten.            

1102
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:16,338
So now we've done all           
that we need to do for          

1103
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:20,476
our height regulars so we       
can done varying right here.    

1104
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:23,412
And did this effect             
height compact, no,             

1105
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,681
no effect on height compact.    

1106
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:30,417
And if we run,                  
we've got width is compact but  

1107
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:33,654
height is regular so            
we're getting five high and     

1108
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:36,990
four across, in a regular       
height we go five high.         

1109
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:39,492
And when we switch over here,   
we get width compact,           

1110
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,595
height compact and we're gonna  
to four high and five across.   

1111
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,701
Hopefully that showed           
you pretty much all             

1112
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,103
the things you need to          
know about auto layout.         

1113
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:56,407
Not just how we vary major      
UI differences between          

1114
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,109
the size classes.               

1115
00:49:58,177 --> 00:50:02,280
But also how you are gonna      
use the document outline over   

1116
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:05,415
here to look at all             
of your constraints.            

1117
00:50:05,484 --> 00:50:09,152
And fix the dark blue ones      
that have magic numbers that    

1118
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,320
you didn't intend.              

1119
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:13,389
You can also use this to        
click on your constraints and   

1120
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,056
look at them.                   

1121
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,891
It's highlighting them here.    

1122
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,659
And inspect them over here.     

1123
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:20,295
And we're still often           
using the size inspector,       

1124
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,764
right here, to look at          
all of our constraints.         

1125
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,434
In the hugging priority we      
briefly showed that's just if   

1126
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:29,703
you have two things that        
are trying to share a space.    

1127
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,038
And you want one to hug and     
one to use the other space,     

1128
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:33,339
you can do the hugging.         

1129
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,875
We also didn't really talk      
about the content compression   

1130
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:38,009
resistance but                  
that's the opposite thing.      

1131
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:40,812
That's where it's trying        
to collapse things down.        

1132
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,781
One of them wants to            
keep its height and             

1133
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:45,417
the other one is happy          
to be collapsed down.           

1134
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:47,418
So that's just kinda            
the opposite of hugging.        

1135
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:51,755
That compressing so             
we can set that as well.        

1136
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:54,358
Any questions about all         
that autolayout business?       

1137
00:50:56,394 --> 00:51:02,165
Okay, so that is it for         
the demo.                       

1138
00:51:02,234 --> 00:51:04,400
And just a little bit           
about what's coming up.         

1139
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:08,370
So tomorrow your assignment     
five is due by midnight.        

1140
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:10,238
No section Friday this week.    

1141
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:12,907
Next week the lectures          
are gonna be about animation.   

1142
00:51:12,976 --> 00:51:16,511
A really important part         
obviously of an iPhone device   

1143
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,580
or iOS device is animating      
things on screen.               

1144
00:51:19,649 --> 00:51:21,449
So we're gonna talk             
about that next week.           

1145
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:34,494
