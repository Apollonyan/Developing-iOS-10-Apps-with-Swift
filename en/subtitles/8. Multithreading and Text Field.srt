00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:07,105
>> Stanford University.         

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:13,044
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193,   
winter quarter of 2017.         

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:17,782
Today I'm going to continue     
that demo that we started last  

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,434
I'm really just going to        
enhance it to be multiple MVC   

5
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,018
time.                           

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,422
again, it gives you a chance    
to see it all happen again.     

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,224
And I'm gonna be going          
very quickly for                

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,893
doing that because we already   
did that in the last demo, so   

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,328
and you did it on               
your homework,                  

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,697
so hopefully it's really,       
really comfortable.             

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,633
Now we're going to dive         
back into the slides and        

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,937
solve a problem that we're      
going to have with our app,     

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,373
which is that                   
it's really slow.               

14
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,309
And not only really slow, but   
it blocks our user interface    

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,712
so that the user thinks         
the app is probably dead and    

16
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,514
needs to be killed or           
something.                      

17
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,317
And we're gonna fix that        
with multithreading, so         

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,286
I'm gonna talk a little about   
how we do multithreading.       

19
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,255
I'll go back to the demo,       

20
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,123
we'll fix it with               
multithreading.                 

21
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,925
I'm gonna show you a couple     
other cool things to do.        

22
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,528
And then we're gonna come       
back to the slides and          

23
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,164
I'm gonna talk about text       
field, which is a little bit    

24
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,667
of a random topic, but          
I have to fit it in somewhere.  

25
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,437
And if I have a little time at  
the end, which I doubt I will,  

26
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,173
but if I have time at the end,  
I'll actually get started on    

27
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,009
table view, which is gonna be   
our big topic for Wednesday.    

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,178
A very important topic, and     

29
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,280
it's what your next             
assignment is gonna be about.   

30
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,082
Sorry, your next assignment     
has multi-threading as well,    

31
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,852
of course, but it's mostly      
a table view assignment, so     

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,519
that's what we're               
gonna do today.                 

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:33,358
So let's jump right back into   
our demo from last time.        

34
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,960
You remember that it            
looked like this, so            

35
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,028
here it is running.             

36
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:42,167
And this was a nice little      
image viewing application so    

37
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:46,338
far, and we can zoom in and     
out, and pan around, and        

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,138
all that.                       

39
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,308
And in fact,                    
in building this application,   

40
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,746
I've built this nice generic    
ImageViewController.            

41
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,049
It's a reusable MVC,            
just like in your assignment,   

42
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,486
you built a reusable graphing   
view controller, well,          

43
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,622
I've built a generic MVC        
that will show an image and     

44
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,460
let you zoom in on it and pan   
around, so, that's kinda cool.  

45
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:14,499
Hopefully you're gaining        
an appreciation for             

46
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,569
good API design, and how        
important good API design and   

47
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,839
reusable componentry is to      
building good architecture in   

48
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:24,208
general, so hopefully,          
you're seeing that.             

49
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,477
I mean, these are very simple   
applications that we're         

50
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,779
writing, so it's hard to see.   

51
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,315
But when you start building     
a huge app and have these       

52
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,151
reuseable components and        
really strong public APIs that  

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,388
you're willing to support, and  
things like that, then you'll   

54
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,990
find that your application      
is gonna have less bugs,        

55
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,092
and it's gonna be able          
to grow over time.              

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,628
And you're gonna be able        
to work in teams better, so     

57
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,130
it's just good all around.      

58
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,736
In my viewDidLoad, I put        
that little imageURL equals     

59
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,905
DemoURL.stanford that           
was just for testing.           

60
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,540
Now that we know                
that it works,                  

61
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,409
I'm just gonna delete that so   

62
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,812
that my ImageViewController     
again can be reusable.          

63
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,882
This is its public API,         
which happens to be its model.  

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,750
It's not that unusual,          

65
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:08,553
by the way, for the public      
API of a view controller        

66
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:12,090
to be to set the model,         
that's quite actually common.   

67
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,758
So that's our model,            
it's the URL for                

68
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,727
the image you wanna show,       
and it's public.                

69
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,331
So we're gonna be using that    
when we build the rest of       

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,899
So our storyboard so far        
just has this one image view    

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,399
our app.                        

72
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,170
controller right here, and I'm  
just gonna rapidly go through   

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,972
and build a multiple MVC app.   

74
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,643
What we're gonna do is          
just use our generic image      

75
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,046
controller MVC here to          
view images related to          

76
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,748
the Cassini project,            

77
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:41,219
which is a space probe that     
was sent out to Saturn.         

78
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,723
To do that, it's gonna be       
all the things you know.        

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,192
I'm going to get it             
build another MVC, so           

80
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,062
here let's drag                 
out another MVC.                

81
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,031
Let's create a class for it.    

82
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,300
It's a Cocoa Touch Class,       
of course,                      

83
00:03:55,369 --> 00:04:00,038
I'm gonna call it Cassini,      
my CassiniViewController.       

84
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm gonna put it in the same    
place that I put all my other   

85
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,910
files here, and here's my       
CassiniViewController.          

86
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm gonna remove my             
ViewController lifecycle but    

87
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,951
I'm gonna leave my prepare for  
segue, without the comments,    

88
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,220
because I am going to           
be segueing from this           

89
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,193
CassiniViewController to        
my ImageViewController.         

90
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,895
So the way this UI is gonna     
work is I'm just gonna have     

91
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,563
three buttons here in Cassini,  

92
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,700
similar to how we had with      
the emotions application.       

93
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,271
And these three buttons are     
going to pick these three URLs  

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,642
right here that are from        
NASA here, jpl.nasa.gov.        

95
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,612
One's of Cassini itself,        
one's of the Earth and          

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,015
one is of Saturn, so we're      
just gonna have three buttons   

97
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,418
that let you pick               
those three images.             

98
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,420
So let's build that UI.         

99
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,490
First of all, let's make        
sure we set our identity.       

100
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,093
We just dragged out             
a generic ViewController,       

101
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,296
we obviously want its identity  
to be a specific subclass,      

102
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,765
in this case,                   
the CassiniViewController,      

103
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,068
just like this one is           
an ImageViewController.         

104
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,405
So let's drag this out to make  
the button a little bigger,     

105
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,640
to get a bigger font.           

106
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:15,113
Try a maybe 40 point,           
something like that.            

107
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,816
The three buttons that I had,   
one was Earth, I'll just do     

108
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,754
copy and paste, make a couple   
more buttons here, another one  

109
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,757
was Cassini itself,             
another one was Saturn.         

110
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,828
And we'll just select these     
and we'll put them in a stack   

111
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,264
view, and we'll put some        
spacing between, and            

112
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,667
we'll fill, and fill equally.   

113
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,336
We'll take it and               
drag it to the middle here.     

114
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,738
We'll use our blue lines        
to put it in the middle, so     

115
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,073
that we can go down here, and   

116
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,875
say Reset to                    
Suggested Constraints.          

117
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,078
We can go to our Size           
Inspector here just to verify   

118
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,815
that the constraints it added   
seem like the ones we want,     

119
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,384
which definitely                
does seem like that.            

120
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,486
Let's go ahead and,             

121
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,022
one thing I wanna show you      
a little different this         

122
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,957
time is before we started with  
a SplitViewController and       

123
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,226
then I added the navigation     
controller in.                  

124
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,895
In other words,                 
I started with an iPad UI,      

125
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,633
building an iPad UI, and then   
I made it also work on iPhone.  

126
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,635
We can do the other             
way around as well.             

127
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,405
So we could take this view      
controller, which is the one,   

128
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,841
the base one that we            
want to show, and               

129
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,512
we can say embed it in          
a Navigation Controller.        

130
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,213
And then, obviously,            
we want to make this            

131
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,382
navigation controller be        
the entry point of our app.     

132
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,084
I don't want to forget that,    
so I'm just gonna throw that    

133
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,886
little arrow over               
here onto the left.             

134
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,689
And then when we do             
our segues here,                

135
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,493
like from Earth over to here,   
and from Cassini.               

136
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,396
And I'm going to Show Detail    
because I know eventually I'm   

137
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,799
also going to support           
the iPad, instead of Show,      

138
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,335
which would only really         
support the iPhone.             

139
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,603
Because Show, remember,         
if you do a Show and            

140
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,239
you're in the master of         
an iPad, it'll actually,        

141
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,875
if you're in Navigation         
Controller in the master of     

142
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,845
the iPad and you do Show, it's  
going to replace the mster,     

143
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,181
whereas Show Detail             
replaces the detail.            

144
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,050
So here I have                  
these three segues.             

145
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,419
I'm gonna kinda cheat           
a little bit and                

146
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:06,324
have my segue identifiers       
just be the names of these      

147
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,060
URLs right here, so             
Cassini, Earth, and Saturn,     

148
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,829
that's gonna be my              
segue identifiers.              

149
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,799
I say it's cheating because     
normally your identifier would  

150
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,268
just identify the segue, and    

151
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,803
then you would get the          
information somewhere else,     

152
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,272
but just to make our code       
really, really simple.          

153
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,474
Oops, that's not Earth,         
that one's Saturn.              

154
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,579
And then let's go to this one,  
wait, where's our Earth?        

155
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,750
And we go to this one,          
oops, this one rather,          

156
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,384
that is Cassini.                

157
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,555
Okay, so we built our UI here.  

158
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,627
Now, this would be really only  
an iPhone appropriate UI.       

159
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:46,030
If we run this on iPhone,       
it actually would look fine,    

160
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,032
you'll see.                     

161
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,035
Now why doesn't                 
this work as is?                

162
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,204
You see I had this right here,  
and I get this modal view,      

163
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,205
it kinda came up.               

164
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,207
Obviously, we have no           
image selected yet,             

165
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,342
we haven't written              
any prepare code.               

166
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,344
But there's no back here.       

167
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,545
Why is there no back?           

168
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,615
That's because of this          
things being show detail.       

169
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,384
Because show detail only works  
in the iPad configuration.      

170
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,287
So like, if I change            
this to being a show.           

171
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:13,491
Well, actually,                 
I'm not sure, someone was       

172
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,428
saying that to we have to       
remake that one to be a show.   

173
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,632
Let's see if that works.        

174
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,836
And this is where               
it goes Saturn.                 

175
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,871
Cuz we're not being prepared.   

176
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,342
All right, see?                 

177
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,279
So now it pushes, we're inside  
the navigation controller.      

178
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,747
We can go back.                 

179
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,617
But this is an iPhone only and  
we don't want that.             

180
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,419
We want to work on              
both platforms.                 

181
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,820
So I am gonna take              
that out again,                 

182
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,889
and put this back to            
be showed detail.               

183
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,826
Anyway, so I have this nice     
iPhone API, or UI rather.       

184
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,494
And I wanna turn into           
split view if, so               

185
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,696
I am going the other way and    
terms of preparing it.          

186
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,198
So lets go down here and        
grab a split view.              

187
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,166
I drag it out here,             

188
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,568
remember it brings all          
this other junk with it.        

189
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,337
We close our document outline,  

190
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,007
you can delete these            
things that came with it.       

191
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,813
Now we have our Split View      
Controller right here, and      

192
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:13,218
we can just use Ctrl+Drag       
to make this be our master.     

193
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,787
And we can put this down here,  
let's say,                      

194
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,356
in control drag to make         
this be our detail.             

195
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:23,227
And let's make our entry        
point the display view and      

196
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,863
just like that now,             

197
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,900
we turn this into something     
that can work on iPad.          

198
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,136
But having these segues we      
show versus show detail is      

199
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,440
kind of an annoying little      
difference between the two      

200
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,274
platforms.                      

201
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,576
So you kinda have to know       
whether you're gonna put        

202
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,478
it into split view or           
not unfortunately,              

203
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,646
when you build your app.        

204
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:48,986
Now, this will still            
work on iPhone.                 

205
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,589
Just begins on                  
the detail to start and         

206
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,725
we can navigate here into       
these various things.           

207
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,562
And it will also work on iPad,  

208
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:07,271
lets see iPad.                  

209
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,641
Here is the thing we can        
slide out our master,           

210
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,243
I click on these things or      
we can go to landscape.         

211
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,147
And again, it's not showing     
anything cuz I haven't yet.     

212
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,215
on iPad maybe we want to        
put this in a navigation        

213
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,215
Now, again,                     

214
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,785
controller right here so,       
we get a nice title over here.  

215
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,555
So I can do that as well,       
just go down here and           

216
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,090
select this new                 
controller down here and        

217
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,192
do embed in                     
navigation control.             

218
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,160
Now if we do that,              

219
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,830
we're gonna be want to be       
careful in our prepare.         

220
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,499
That when we prepare for        
this segue, we account for      

221
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,201
this navigation controller      
perhaps being there.            

222
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,670
And I'm gonna show you          
how to do that as well.         

223
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,806
Let's do our prepare.           

224
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,673
We've got our UI,               

225
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,576
same kinda UI as we did in      
emotions, exactly the same.     

226
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,814
But obviously nothing works     
in these segues unless we       

227
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,466
So, let's go to our prepare     
for segue here and type it in.  

228
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,050
prepare.                        

229
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,853
It's gonna be a really          
simple prepare for segue,       

230
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,523
cuz I made the segue            
identifier be the thing I'm     

231
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,091
gonna look up in the table.     

232
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,728
So I'm just gonna say           
if I can let the URL,           

233
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:08,600
that I want the NASA URL,       
equal DemoURL.NASA.             

234
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,770
And I'm gonna look it up, by    
taking the segue identifier,    

235
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,841
but if that segue identified    
with nil, this won't work.      

236
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,742
In other words,                 

237
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,545
you can't look up something     
that's an optional,             

238
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,914
like the identifier is,         
in a dictionary.                

239
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,783
This dictionary is looking for  
a string here.                  

240
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:29,487
So, I'm just gonna say          
defaulting to nothing.          

241
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,090
And of course, looking this     
up in this dictionary,          

242
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,324
it's gonna return nil.          

243
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,427
But I'm doing if let right      
here, so that's okay.           

244
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,031
Now I'm getting the URL if      
possible, so that segue,        

245
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,600
if it's possible to             
get that URL out of             

246
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,537
the NASA dictionary,            
then I will do that.            

247
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,270
Now, of course,                 

248
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,372
I need the view controller      
that I'm segueing to.           

249
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,508
So I'm gonna say,               

250
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:56,146
if I can let imageVC =          
(segue.destination as?          

251
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,382
ImageViewController.            

252
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,854
That's that view controller     
that we're segueing to.         

253
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,925
If I can do that,               
then I can prepare.             

254
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,661
But of course, here we've       
got the problem where this      

255
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,697
destination on an iPad          
might be, what?                 

256
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,665
A navigation controller.        

257
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,502
So normally, we would           
put a little if in here,        

258
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,404
we say if the thing is          
a navigation controller,        

259
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,341
then we would get               
the visible view controller.    

260
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,809
Remember that code              
that we put in there?           

261
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,944
You probably put that           
in your homework,               

262
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,014
if you used navigation          
control for your detail.        

263
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,283
Instead, I'm gonna put          
that in an extension,           

264
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,652
remember we learned about       
extensions last time?           

265
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,322
So I'm going to extend          
UI view controller, and         

266
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,159
just add a var to               
UIViewController.               

267
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,196
Now this var I'm gonna add,     
I'm gonna call it contents,     

268
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,733
and it's going to be of         
type UIViewController.          

269
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,102
And since it's in               
the extension,                  

270
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,171
it can't be a var               
that has any storage.           

271
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,106
Extensions have no storage.     

272
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,976
So it can only be a computed    
var so I'm gonna compute it.    

273
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,712
And what is contents gonna be,  
what is this var?               

274
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,748
Well, I'm defining contents     
to be the contents of this      

275
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,918
view controller, what this      
view controller holds?          

276
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,688
Well, if this view controller   
is a navigation controller,     

277
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,690
then tha's the visible          
view controller.                

278
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,293
If it's not,                    
then it's just itself,          

279
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,329
a view controller's             
contents are itself.            

280
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,164
Unless, it happens to be        
a navigation controller and     

281
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,765
then it returns to              
visible view controller.        

282
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,802
I could also,                   

283
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,071
And if I am,                    
show the visible tab, too.      

284
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,973
But for interest of             
time I won't do that,           

285
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,308
you can do that if you want.    

286
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:36,747
I'm just gonna say here if      
I can let navcon = self as?     

287
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,416
a UINavigationController.       

288
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,019
In other words, if I'm a        
navigation controller then I'm  

289
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,522
just going to return            
the navcon's visible.           

290
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,389
Navcon is myself,               

291
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,025
it's just that it's myself      
as a navigation controller.     

292
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:52,029
So I can send this var,         
I can get this var from it.     

293
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,966
Of course, this visible         
view controller is optional     

294
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,601
because the navigation          
controller might not have any   

295
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,437
view controller in              
it at the moment.               

296
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,440
So, I better have a default     
there which I'll just           

297
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,741
return self.                    

298
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,410
And then if I'm not in          
navigation controller,          

299
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:11,215
then I'm just                   
gonna return self.              

300
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,784
So you see how content, it's    
showing the contents of our     

301
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,487
navigation folder, otherwise,   
it's returning myself.          

302
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,656
Which is kind of cool for       
this situation.                 

303
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,191
And it allows me to go up       
here, instead of saying segue   

304
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,061
destination, I can just say     
sequedestination.content.       

305
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,266
And then I don't need           
this little if up there.        

306
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,803
Now, is this a reasonable       
thing to do in extension?       

307
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,307
Absolutely it is, because       
this var has complete and       

308
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,777
utter understandable semantics  
that only have to do            

309
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,846
with the UI view                
controller and                  

310
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,916
nothing to do with Casini view  
controller or anything else.    

311
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,585
Because when you                
do an extension,                

312
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,353
you want that to be the case.   

313
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,889
You don't wanna generally put   
extensions on other classes     

314
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,958
that have to do with            
other classes, generally.       

315
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,827
Unless they're kind of          
like standard types, or         

316
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,395
something like that.            

317
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,130
Maybe converting from           
a string to a date,             

318
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,165
or something like that.         

319
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,601
In some way might               
make some sense, but            

320
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,670
you wouldn't want to put        
extensions on other classes     

321
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,707
that are specific to things     
that other classes need.        

322
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,211
In that case, just put          
a function in your own class    

323
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,312
that does that thing.           

324
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,181
So does everyone see what       
I'm saying about this?          

325
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,617
This makes perfect sense,       

326
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,785
this would be usable            
in any environment,             

327
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,555
it's a sensible var to          
have on a view controller.      

328
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,360
Now that I have my              
image view controller,          

329
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,361
either by getting it or         

330
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,064
going through the navigation    
controller, I can prepare it.   

331
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,232
And so                          
preparing it is really easy,    

332
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,235
I just wanna set the URL        
equal to that URL, okay,        

333
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,504
the URL that I got              
out of the demo URL.            

334
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:44,341
This is just public API, okay,  
this happens to be its model,   

335
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,043
let's also set its title.       

336
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,411
We can set the title equal to,  

337
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,313
we could do the same            
thing we did before.            

338
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,216
Take the sender interpret       
it as a UI button and           

339
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,187
if we're able to do that then   
we'll get the current title.    

340
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,990
Which might be nil, but         

341
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,292
that's okay because this        
is also an optional.            

342
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,828
This is optional so can take    
a nil even though this is nil.  

343
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,498
And of course it might be nil   
because this turns out to not   

344
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,866
be true, and that's fine, too.  

345
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,571
See how these optionals play    
out nicely because you have     

346
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,639
vars that are optional and      
things are optional?            

347
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,675
So you can set things           
equal to each other and         

348
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,911
it kind of just all plays out   
kind of beautifully there.      

349
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,747
So that's it, let's run here.   

350
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,951
Let's see                       

351
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,389
what we got.                    

352
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:32,957
Here we go.                     
So                              

353
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,692
let's take a look at Cassini,   
for                             

354
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:38,963
example, look, it's broken.     

355
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,063
Whoa, what's going on?          

356
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:46,803
I clicked there to get Cassini  
which, look, there's Cassini.   

357
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,307
Let's zoom in on Cassini.       

358
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,175
There it is.                    

359
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,946
So this is the Cassini space    
probe right here by Saturn.     

360
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,749
But when I clicked on it,       
it seemed like my UI froze.     

361
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,117
And if I click on these         
other ones, look,               

362
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,353
I'm clicking Saturn, Saturn,    
Saturn, nothing's happening.    

363
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,555
Because it,                     
now something came up.          

364
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,725
So this UI seems broken.        

365
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,528
Now we're on ultra              
fast network here.              

366
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,562
This is Stanford's network.     

367
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,232
We have like gigabyte           
connections to everywhere and   

368
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,733
it still took a while cuz       
it's a very large file.         

369
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,504
Imagine I was on cellular.      

370
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,375
That image might take           
a minute to download.           

371
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,310
And meanwhile my app            
is completely stuck,            

372
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,112
I can't click on                
any other button.               

373
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:28,980
If I'm on iPhone,               

374
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,349
lets see what he looks like     
on iPhone, it's even worse.     

375
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,419
If I'm on iPhone,               
I'm gonna click that.           

376
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,688
I'm gonna think,                
" my app is broken".            

377
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,690
So I'm in                       
a NavigationController,         

378
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,491
no problem,                     
I'll just hit back.             

379
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,697
But even the back button's      

380
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:53,070
not gonna work, as you'll see.  

381
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,774
All right, so here we are.      

382
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:58,943
Got the detailed view there.    

383
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,046
Now I'm gonna hit Earth,        
it's stuck.                     

384
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,313
And again,                      
I can't do anything.            

385
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,849
Finally comes back.             

386
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,953
So this kinda UI is horrible    
because, especially on          

387
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,055
cellular or something           
where it's really slow,         

388
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,556
users are like,                 
this app is broken.             

389
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,892
They're literally going         
to double-click the Home        

390
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,429
button and flip your app off,   
to use an analogy there.        

391
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,965
They're gonna flip your app     
and kill it because their,      

392
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,500
they think it's broken.         

393
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,936
So we're gonna fix              
that with multitasking.         

394
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:31,441
So first, let me show           

395
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,647
you how that works.             

396
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,517
All right, so, multithreading.  

397
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,154
There's two reasons generally,  

398
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,556
that you wanna do               
multithreading.                 

399
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,759
One reason is, you have         
a mathematical problem, or      

400
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,863
some image processing problem,  
that is best solved             

401
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,433
using some kind of parallel     
processing algorithm where you  

402
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,137
wanna go off and do 1000        
things or 100 things at once.   

403
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,639
And then and when they're all   
done together you're gonna      

404
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,908
combine the result, or          
something like that.            

405
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,579
So that's an obvious need       
to do multithreading.           

406
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,281
That's not the multithreading   
I'm gonna be                    

407
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,482
talking to you about.           

408
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,717
That, that's a perfectly        
valid use of multithreading,    

409
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,719
iOS has some great API for      
doing that kind of design.      

410
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,456
But that's not what             
I'm talking about.              

411
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,759
The second reason that you      
might wanna do multithreading   

412
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,961
is because you                  
have one thread.                

413
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,730
By the way, does everyone       
know what a thread is?          

414
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,665
Raise your hand if you          
know what a thread is.          

415
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,468
Okay, I see some people         
saying, yeah, remind me.        

416
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,839
A thread just means, thread is  
short for thread of execution.  

417
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,210
And it just is kind of a,       
the process,                    

418
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,414
through which code              
is executing.                   

419
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,417
That could conceivably be       
separated where you have        

420
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,285
multiple of them.               

421
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,170
in the iOS, you've got a very   
important kind of main thread   

422
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:51,987
For example,                    

423
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,640
That's the thread of execution  
that is listening to gestures   

424
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,224
of execution.                   

425
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,162
and doing drawing,              
things like that.               

426
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
Then you can have other         
threads of execution that       

427
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,733
might be doing background       
things, like going out onto     

428
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,803
the network and getting data,   
or something like that.         

429
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,373
Most of our devices aren't      
multiprocessor, per se, so      

430
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,877
these threads, although they    
have multiple cores, so         

431
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,412
they can actually do            
two things at once.             

432
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,580
They literally can.             

433
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,783
But in this case where I'm      
talking about multithreading    

434
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:23,287
to solve this problem of        
keeping the UI responsive,      

435
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,888
we don't even care about that.  

436
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,659
And so here's the thing with    
multithreading and the UI.      

437
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,662
We want the thread of           
execution which is listening    

438
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,865
to the user to be super         
responsive, always working,     

439
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,299
never blocked.                  

440
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,703
And we don't really care        
about other threads too much,   

441
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,407
but we really want that one     
to be unblocked at all time.    

442
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,510
So if we're ever going to do    
anything that would block,      

443
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,947
like either block because it's  
doing so much computation       

444
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,884
that it's not getting back      
to the rest of the code.        

445
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,620
Or in this case, with our       
Cassini, it's gonna block       

446
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,456
because it's waiting on some    
resource like the network.      

447
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,893
Okay, I make a request for      
a URL.                          

448
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,496
It doesn't respond              
immediately, I have to wait.    

449
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,198
Any time I have to wait, I      
can't be waiting in the middle  

450
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,734
of that UI cuz now no           
one can do a gesture or         

451
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,604
click on the back button or     
do anything else.               

452
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,306
So that's the kind of           
multithreading that I'm         

453
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,874
talking about here that         
we're gonna try and             

454
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,811
solve, is keep the UI thread    
responsive and active           

455
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,314
by pushing everything else      
that could be slow or blocked,  

456
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,418
waiting on a resource,          
off to a different thread.      

457
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,019
Now in iOS,                     

458
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,755
we don't actually even really   
talk about threads much.        

459
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,089
I've been using                 
this word thread,               

460
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,892
because that's what's going     
on underneath the covers.       

461
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,961
We're talking about             
threads of execution here.      

462
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,031
But really,                     
what we talk about is queues.   

463
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:45,068
So multithreading is            
really about queues.            

464
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,036
Now what's a queue?             

465
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,939
Queue is an English word,       
actually.                       

466
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,941
We don't use it in              
the United States much, but     

467
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,276
a queue just means a line.      

468
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,979
Like if you go to the movies,   
you might say, I'm queueing up  

469
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,881
to see this movie, especially   
if you were in London,          

470
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,318
you would say let's go          
queue for the movie.            

471
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:04,288
So that's all a queue is,       
it's a line.                    

472
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,756
And what are we gonna           
put in this line?               

473
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,823
Instead of people waiting for   

474
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,360
the movie, we're gonna          
put blocks of code.             

475
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,830
And we know a great way to      
make a block of code that we    

476
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,766
can put in a line               
which is a closure.             

477
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,768
So we're almost always          
doing this with closure.        

478
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,538
So putting these closures,      
it could be any blocking code,  

479
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,740
but we're putting these         
closures basically,             

480
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,275
usually into a queue.           

481
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,811
And so what's happening         
then is the system              

482
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,348
is creating threads as          
necessary to grab those         

483
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,251
blocks off that queue, off the  
front of the line, who's ever   

484
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,321
in the front of the queue and   
executing on a thread.          

485
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,457
That's how multitasking or      

486
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,926
multithreading really           
works in iOS.                   

487
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,763
We don't really care how        
the system assigns threads to   

488
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,565
these lines, these queues.      

489
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,300
All we care about               
is the queues.                  

490
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,304
And when we wanna express       
to the system where we want     

491
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,973
things to run, you know,        
where the UI runs or            

492
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,175
in background process or        
whatever,                       

493
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,644
we specify it by what           
queue we put code on.           

494
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,047
Does that make sense?           

495
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,786
Let's talk about the queues     
that we can have.               

496
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,722
One important queue,            
of course, is the main queue.   

497
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,792
So this is the queue            
on which all the UI             

498
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,193
activity is happening.          

499
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,530
It's not only the queue that    
all UI activity is happening    

500
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,967
But it's the only queue that    
UI activity can happen on.      

501
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,602
in general.                     

502
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,272
And that's because              
it's a serial queue.            

503
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,842
A serial queue is               
a queue where everyone,         

504
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,844
the blocks in code              
are waiting in line to run,     

505
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,447
and there's only one            
thread to run them.             

506
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,618
So when the system comes along  
to grab the next guy in line,   

507
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:44,921
he runs him to completion and   
then goes back for              

508
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,123
the next one.                   

509
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,858
So you see how they're serial.  

510
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,759
They happen in order.           

511
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:51,929
The entire line of closures     
waiting to run, or code         

512
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:56,300
waiting to run, is processed    
in order, one at a time.        

513
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,102
What's really great about       
the UI side of that is it       

514
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,738
makes it very predictable.      

515
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,473
You really don't have to get    
into a lot of the mind games    

516
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,977
of multithreading, where it's   
like, is this thing waiting on  

517
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,047
this, do I have to have a lock  
on this data resource bug?      

518
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,349
Because all the UI stuff        
is all happening in             

519
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,250
the main queue.                 

520
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,951
This is all                     
happening serially,             

521
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,654
you never have to worry about   
two UI things accessing         

522
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,789
the same data structure         
at the same time,               

523
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,293
cuz they're all just marching   
in line, down this main queue.  

524
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,831
So, all UI activity and only    
UI activity, no other stuff,    

525
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,301
generally, runs in the UI,      
the main queue.                 

526
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,704
And the reason we don't want    
other stuff running in the      

527
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,573
main queue, is we never want    
the main queue to be blocked.   

528
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,743
We never want it to be off      
doing some computation or,      

529
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,144
certainly, never                
blocked waiting for             

530
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,046
the network or something.       

531
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:43,814
So that's the main queue,       

532
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,682
that's the most important       
queue, and then,                

533
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,384
there are these other queues.   

534
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,986
I'm gonna talk first            
about the global queues.        

535
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,290
The global queues               
are different kind of queues.   

536
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,061
These global queues, people     
wait in line to go onto those,  

537
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,596
and at the other end of the     
line the system has multiple    

538
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,198
threads ready to go.            

539
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,067
And it can pull a closure off   
the line, give it a thread,     

540
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,303
it starts running,              
pulls another one off,          

541
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,072
it starts running before        
the first one's even done.      

542
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,209
So those are called             
concurrent queues.              

543
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,979
The queues where you could be   
pulling people off the line     

544
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,415
cuz you got multiple threads    
to assign to the task.          

545
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,218
So, things we do                
outside the UI,                 

546
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:24,688
like network things and things  
that block, we're generally     

547
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,392
gonna do those in these         
global concurrent queues.       

548
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,261
You can also create your        
own serial queues and           

549
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,163
your own concurrent queues.     

550
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,665
We'll talk about that           
in a couple slides.             

551
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,633
You're not going to need        
to do that in this class.       

552
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,803
90% of the time you're either   
using the main queue, or        

553
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,772
you're using one of these       
global concurrent queues.       

554
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,008
So let's talk about the code,   
how do you get a queue?         

555
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,844
I need a queue because I wanna  
put a block of code on this     

556
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,614
queue, I want it to             
get in line to go run.          

557
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,948
Well, the main queue,           

558
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,851
you just use this bar           
DispatchQueue.main.             

559
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,620
It's a static bar,              
a class bar,                    

560
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,089
on the class dispatch queue,    
and that's it,                  

561
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:02,325
you have your main queue,       
it couldn't be easier.          

562
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,162
Now, getting one of these       
global concurrent queues,       

563
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,863
a little bit more work.         

564
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,632
You're going to use             
DispatchQueue.global instead    

565
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,404
of DispatchQueue.main, and it   
takes an argument there, QoS.   

566
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:18,275
QoS stands for                  
Quality of Service.             

567
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,044
So this is talking about how,   
what                            

568
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,748
the quality of the service      
that the line is getting.       

569
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,417
So, high quality service means  
things are being pulled off     

570
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,253
the line really fast and the    
threads that are being used to  

571
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,924
execute them are high priority  
threads that get to run a lot.  

572
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:36,092
Cuz remember there's            
only one processor, so          

573
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,962
they often kinda                
share the processor.            

574
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,563
So, high quality service        
means you get a lot.            

575
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,467
Low quality services, well,     
the system will pull your       

576
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,403
thing off when it feels like    
it, like maybe the phone is,    

577
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,772
is well, got woken up for       
some other reason,              

578
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,007
it's not gonna wake             
your phone up to do it.         

579
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,544
And it's certainly not going    
to block any high priority      

580
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,479
thing, that kind of thing.      

581
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,149
So, but the quality of service  
is not like a number, 0,        

582
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,919
low quality, 10,                
high quality, instead,          

583
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,322
it's kind of                    
a flavor of usage.              

584
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,257
These are the four              
qualities of services here.     

585
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:11,761
So user interactive is, means   
the user is interacting with    

586
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,265
the UI right now,               
usually with a gesture.         

587
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,435
They are panning around, or     
pinching, and your forking off  

588
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,938
something into a thread         
to go do something.             

589
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,074
Now, this is usually not a      
case of the thing you're gonna  

590
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,576
be doing is so intensive        
that it would block the main    

591
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,613
thread, because the person      
is panning right now.           

592
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,783
But it might be something       
that can't quite keep up        

593
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,152
with the finger, and you're     
going to deal with that by,     

594
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,022
in this other thread, trying    
to keep up as best you can and  

595
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,357
just updating the main          
thread as fast as you can,      

596
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,660
which might be a little slower  
than the fingers going.         

597
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,262
So, you know,                   
the finger dragging around,     

598
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,897
maybe it's jumping a little     
bit because it can't calculate  

599
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,632
its new position fast enough.   

600
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,402
But the point is, this          
queue really needs to run,      

601
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:55,505
almost as bad, it's almost      
as high priority as the main    

602
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,575
queue because you're doing      
something interactive.          

603
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,844
Okay, the next one              
is user initiated.              

604
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,381
What this means is this, the    
user currently did something    

605
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,184
to initiate this activity,      
this can be done in             

606
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,953
this queue, so                  
it's pretty high priority.      

607
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,789
Okay, the user did something    
and they're waiting for         

608
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,090
a response presumably.          

609
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,562
So that would be the category   
for our Cassini project.        

610
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,366
We clicked Earth, or Saturn,    
we want that image now, and     

611
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,633
we're waiting for it.           

612
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,336
So we are gonna use,            
user initiated.                 

613
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,305
Cuz the user initiated          
a request for it.               

614
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,206
But it's gonna take a while,    

615
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,808
and the user's not              
interacting, we're not          

616
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,311
making it doing something       
different every time it moves.  

617
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,446
We were just, it's, but         
it was user initiated, so       

618
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,648
user initiated is               
pretty high priority.           

619
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,650
Then there's background and     
utility.                        

620
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,952
These are somewhat similar.     

621
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:46,056
Utility is truly the deepest    
of background processes.        

622
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,625
This might be something you     
run once a week in your app.    

623
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,194
Maybe it cleans up              
the database by removing old    

624
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,061
crufty stuff,                   

625
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,865
something the user doesn't      
even know is going on.          

626
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,732
It's so low priority,           

627
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,267
it just kind of happens         
in the background.              

628
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,670
Background might be             
something that you, you,        

629
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,306
like maybe you're thinking      
ahead a little bit about        

630
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,507
the way the user might          
want to use your app.           

631
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,509
And so you fork something       
off in the background to go     

632
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,744
fetch some stuff or whatever.   

633
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,113
The user didn't ask you to do   
it, but you kind of do it.      

634
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,482
And you kind of                 
want it nowish but              

635
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,318
it's okay if it takes           
a little while.                 

636
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,686
So you see what that one is.    

637
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,989
So these are the four           
qualities of service and        

638
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,658
you just need to pick which     
quality of service you want     

639
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:22,893
for your global queue.          

640
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,362
And then remember that          
the things you put on there     

641
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,263
are going to be run             
concurrently, so                

642
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,599
they can really                 
depend on each other.           

643
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:33,036
I'll talk about things          
depending on each other in      

644
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,254
But this, you wanna think       
about the things you put on     

645
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,404
a second.                       

646
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,974
these global queues             
as being these                  

647
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,475
independent little things,      
like go fetch this file,        

648
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,179
it's all self contained,        
just give me this file.         

649
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,915
Not blocks that are gonna       
be somehow depending on         

650
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,283
each other's results because    
this is all concurrent,         

651
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,852
these things can be happening   
at exactly the same time, so    

652
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,688
they can't really, it's not     
serial like the main queue.     

653
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,692
Now, like I said,               
you've got this queue,          

654
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,462
and all we're gonna do          
is put blocks on it and         

655
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,834
we do that with these two       
functions, async and sync.      

656
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,104
These two functions take one    
argument, which is a closure,   

657
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,941
a function but usually it's     
a closure, that closure         

658
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,645
function takes no arguments     
and returns no arguments.       

659
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,848
And you can put anything        
you want in that closure.       

660
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,719
So, async means put this        
closure on the queue,           

661
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,189
put it in the line to execute,  
and return immediately.         

662
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,191
So async does                   
nothing except for              

663
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,996
put that block into the queue,  
whatever queue you send it to.  

664
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,999
Sync, same thing,               
puts it in the queue and        

665
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:40,103
then it says block this thread  
until that closure finishes     

666
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,373
executing on whatever           
queue it's on.                  

667
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,941
Which could be a totally        
different queue.                

668
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,645
So basically, the sync is       
block me until this closure     

669
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,950
finishes executing              
wherever you put it.            

670
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,020
So, you would never do          
sync on the main queue,         

671
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,089
cuz we never want to            
block the main queue.           

672
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,592
So, you would never say         
main queue.sync anything.       

673
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,795
But you might have              
other queues and say,           

674
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:10,834
you know, sorry, you would say  
main queue, you could say main  

675
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,736
queue.sync, but you would       
say it on another thread.       

676
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,472
You fire off some               
of the thread,                  

677
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,073
it's running along              
in the background.              

678
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,110
It could say main queue.sync,   
this code.                      

679
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,178
Now that code would be          
put on the main queue.          

680
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,746
Sometime later,                 
we don't know when,             

681
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,981
it would run on                 
the main queue.                 

682
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,352
Once it's done,                 
then your thread,               

683
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,155
your queue that issued this,    
would continue.                 

684
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,361
So sync, we would only do the   
sync from code that is not on   

685
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,397
the main queue, cuz we never    
wanna block the main queue.     

686
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,665
Question.                       

687
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,801
Yeah, so the question is,       
when I say sync, am I saying,   

688
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,238
let this block, this closure    
go first or something?          

689
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,540
No, okay, this has nothing      
to do with priority.            

690
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,709
The priority is                 
the quality of service.         

691
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,211
I'm just saying                 
put this queue,                 

692
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,813
this closure onto               
the end of that queue.          

693
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,582
Now, whatever queue it is,      

694
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,151
we'll have some                 
quality of service and          

695
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,020
it will eventually              
get to this thing.              

696
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,288
In the meantime,                
while all that's happening,     

697
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:11,194
this queue that this code is    
in is waiting, it's blocked.    

698
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,364
It's just blocked, waiting for  
that closure to finish.         

699
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,399
How that closure finishes       
depends totally on what queue   

700
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,868
you put it on, and how much     
other stuff is in that queue,   

701
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,905
and whether it's a concurrent   
queue, all those things.        

702
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,010
But this sync just means block  
me until that thing's done.     

703
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,613
Question.                       

704
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,115
So the question is,             
does running multiple threads,  

705
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,551
having multiple things          
going in multiple threads,      

706
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,419
does it slow down               
the main queue thread,          

707
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,421
the thread that is              
running the main queue?         

708
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,756
And the answer is no.           

709
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,693
It does not usually, because    
the main queue is getting       

710
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,428
a lot of high priority.         

711
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,031
So it's pretty much             
interrupting anything those     

712
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,834
other guys are doing whenever   
it wants to run, okay?          

713
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,868
So if it wants to run,          

714
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,636
it pretty much gets             
the processor.                  

715
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,507
The main queue is the highest   
priority thread that exist on   

716
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,008
the device.                     

717
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,079
So it's rarely gonna            
be slowed down.                 

718
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,048
Now, I'm not gonna talk         
about this, but yes,            

719
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,883
threads have overhead.          

720
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,485
If you created                  
thousands of threads,           

721
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,153
that would start slowing        
down your computer.             

722
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,455
But again, that's why we don't  
really talk about threads.      

723
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,456
We talk about queues and        

724
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,159
we let the iOS manage the       
threads cuz it knows how to     

725
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,895
efficiently manage thread       
pools and things like that.     

726
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,801
You can create your             
own queues just using           

727
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,804
a normal initializer            
of DispatchQueue.               

728
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,673
Instead of saying               
DispatchQueue.main or           

729
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,642
DispatchQueue.global, you       
say DispatchQueue               

730
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,212
with the initializer that       
takes a label that makes        

731
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,813
a serial queue.                 

732
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,950
And that label,                 
it shows up in the debugger.    

733
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,984
So in the debugger              
if you pause and                

734
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,887
that queue is                   
running a thread,               

735
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,122
you'll see that thread in       
the little debugger window on   

736
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,825
the left in the navigator       
with this name, this label,     

737
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,461
so it's just purely for         
seeing it in the debugger.      

738
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,629
And if you wanna make your      
own concurrent queue.           

739
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,233
A queue that has multiple       
threads that can be working     

740
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,066
on things.                      

741
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,936
Then same thing, except you     
put attributes.concurrent,      

742
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,039
in the initializer there.       

743
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,175
You won't need to do            
that in this class and          

744
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:05,875
rarely do we do this.           

745
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,411
It's usually main queue and     

746
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,814
the global queues               
90% of the time.                

747
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,584
All right, I'm only showing     
you the absolute tip            

748
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,652
of the iceberg for              
multithreading.                 

749
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,055
I'm showing you the basic       
stuff you need to get stuff     

750
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,757
off of the main thread but      
there is a lot more.            

751
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,760
You're gonna wanna familiarize  
yourself eventually with        

752
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,230
DispatchQueue and               
all the things that it can do.  

753
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,198
This stuff is all               
based on something              

754
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,134
called Grand Central Dispatch.  

755
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,370
Because when we put             
a closure onto a queue,         

756
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:38,175
we call that dispatching        
the closure onto that queue.    

757
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,579
For those of you who do         
know about multithreading,      

758
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,648
you can do all the things       
you can expect,                 

759
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:49,018
protecting critical sections,   
readers and writers, you know,  

760
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,820
single writer                   
multiple readers.               

761
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,856
You can do synchronous          
dispatch, you can do locking,   

762
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,291
all the things you              
need to do you can do.          

763
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,561
I'm not gonna talk about any    
of that, but it's all there.    

764
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,333
There is another API for        
doing multithreading,           

765
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,405
OperationQueue and Operation,   
these are classes.              

766
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,373
Classes or structs,             
I guess they're classes.        

767
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,142
And you'll see those            
occasionally in iOS API,        

768
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,011
kinda older iOS API.            

769
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,047
But for the program             
you're gonna do, again,         

770
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,615
unless you got the kind of      
multithreading problem, which   

771
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,819
is doing a parallel processing  
thing, not the kind of problem  

772
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,488
where you're getting            
something off the main queue.   

773
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,758
Operation and OperationQueue    
are nice because it makes easy  

774
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,326
to make dependencies.           

775
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,661
Where you say this              
block of code                   

776
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,696
depends on this                 
one running first,              

777
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,632
I need the result from this     
one before I can do this one.   

778
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,434
So you can set up               
those relationships,            

779
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,703
then you can say,               
now I just start running them.  

780
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,604
And the system                  

781
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,474
will make sure this one gets    
run before this one, etc.       

782
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,375
All those dependencies.         

783
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:48,545
So that's Operation and         
OperationQueue.                 

784
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,653
you'll see certain methods      
that are multithreaded.         

785
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,222
In iOS,                         

786
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,856
And you'll see that             
in the documentation,           

787
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,491
you'll read in                  
the documentation.              

788
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,261
And the way it works is you're  
gonna see a method that takes   

789
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,164
a closure as an argument, and   
it'll say in the documentation  

790
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,867
this closure is run on another  
thread off the main queue.      

791
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,168
And when you see that,          

792
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,905
you have to go, uh-oh, because  
any code I put in that closure  

793
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,409
that I'm passing to this        
function can't be doing any     

794
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,678
UI stuff because that only      
can happen on the main queue.   

795
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,481
And this happens quite a lot,   
that we have a closure that     

796
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,750
we're putting on some           
background queue, or            

797
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,286
passing to some iOS function,   

798
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,188
that says it's not gonna        
put it on the main queue.       

799
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,692
But we still wanna do UI        
stuff, so how do we do that?    

800
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,761
We just dispatch it             
back to the main queue.         

801
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,564
And this is what                
that looks like.                

802
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:46,669
Here is an iOS API that takes   
a closure as an argument and    

803
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,606
it runs that closure            
off the main queue.             

804
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,541
I's called NSURLSession,        
i's used for                    

805
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,477
getting the contents of URLs.   

806
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,547
Now, you saw in our image       
view controller demo, so far,   

807
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,017
that we already know how to     
get the contents of URLs,       

808
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,486
we just use data contents of.   

809
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,922
Remember, we said try           
data contents of.               

810
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,125
And it blocked, blocked the     
main queue while it went and    

811
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,126
got that URL.                   

812
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,427
So that's one way to do it.     

813
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:14,631
But it kind of                  
non-configurable.               

814
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,933
What's cool about               
NSURLSession is,                

815
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,036
you see that argument there     
configuration.default?          

816
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,537
Well, you can change            
that configuration.             

817
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,040
For example, you could say,     
I'm gonna fetch this URL,       

818
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,876
but don't fetch                 
it over cellular.               

819
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,611
Only fetch it if I              
happen to be on a Wi-Fi         

820
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,980
network, for example.           

821
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,749
So you can configure how you    
want this fetching to happen.   

822
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,885
So it's kind of a more          
powerful way of fetching than   

823
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,854
just saying data contents of.   

824
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:42,191
And the way it works is you     
create an NSURLSession with a,  

825
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,962
(this is an old slide, so it's  
just called URLSession and URL  

826
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,768
not NSURL), but you create it   
with a certain configuration,   

827
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:55,471
then you get the URL you        
want and then you call this     

828
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,042
method dataTask(with: url) and  
closure.                        

829
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,512
And what this does is it        
creates a dataTask object.      

830
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,082
With that URL that you          
want to get, and when, and      

831
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,717
it goes off to fetch it,        
or it will in a minute.         

832
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,386
And when you send               
it off to fetch it,             

833
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,055
when it comes back it will      
call this closure and           

834
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,590
this closure has                
three arguments.                

835
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,493
The data it got from the URL,   
the NSURL or                    

836
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,930
the URL response,               
and then some error,            

837
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,400
if some error happened          
trying to get it.               

838
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,670
So the, that closure, so this   
closure is interesting cuz it,  

839
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,339
the documentation               
will tell you,                  

840
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,275
this closure does not           
run on the main queue.          

841
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,878
So, that's a problem because    
if, (by the way, that resume,   

842
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,513
task.resume at the bottom,      

843
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,516
that's what actually causes     
it to go do the fetch),         

844
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,185
so the dataTask really          
doesn't do anything but         

845
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,522
create the task, and then when  
you say task.resume it goes     

846
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,625
off to fetch it on some         
other thread, doesn't block.    

847
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,661
task.resume does not            
block obviously.                

848
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,196
So when the closure,            

849
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,033
when the data is gotten and     
that closure is finally called  

850
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,535
on some other queue             
besides the main queue.         

851
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,338
You wanna do some UI in there   
like you wanna show the image   

852
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,173
that you just fetched or        
whatever.                       

853
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,943
And you can't do it because     
you're not on the main queue.   

854
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,245
So, how do you fix that?        

855
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:13,082
You just put inside of this     

856
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,186
closure that you put right      
here, another dispatch.         

857
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,788
Back to the main queue.         

858
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:24,827
DispatchQueue.main.async with   
a closure.                      

859
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,295
And you put your                
UI stuff in there,              

860
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,399
now it's gonna happen back on   
the other, on the main queue.   

861
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,404
So let's go through,            
I wanna show you the timing     

862
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,905
of each of the steps of         
this code right here.           

863
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,009
So you can see what's           
happening, when.                

864
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,145
Because multithreading is       
really a lot about when, and    

865
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,880
it's the when that can          
confuse people when             

866
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,449
they're doing multithreading.   

867
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,852
So obviously, the first line    
of code is that let url,        

868
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,155
get the url, so                 
now I have the url.             

869
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,889
Next, we're gonna               
create this dataTask.           

870
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,058
This line of code, line B       
there, returns immediately.     

871
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,027
Because all it does is          
create the dataTask,            

872
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,595
it doesn't actually             
do anything.                    

873
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,632
You pass the closure to it,     
but it's a non-escaping         

874
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:06,569
Closure, hold onto it, this     
data task thing holds onto it.  

875
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:10,306
Then you do task resume,        
that also returns immediately.  

876
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,809
But on a different queue,       
it starts doing the fetch.      

877
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,012
It starts trying to get         
the contents of that URL.       

878
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,012
But on some other queue, so     

879
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,149
that's why on this queue, this  
is the main queue presumably.   

880
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,450
It is returning immediately,    

881
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,085
task.resume returns             
immediately.                    

882
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,489
So that means that line H       
happens immediately right       

883
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,425
after task resume,              
boom the print firing,          

884
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,761
done firing off the request.    

885
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,895
But that's all                  
we've done is fired             

886
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,097
off the request at this point.  

887
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,901
The next line of code that's    
gonna happen after this one     

888
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,436
is this one.                    

889
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,072
So after the URL                
contents come back,             

890
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,275
now this closure                
is gonna execute.               

891
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,177
And so we're gonna have         
line c be executed.             

892
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,781
So a, b, g, and h, they         
executed boom, boom, boom,      

893
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,550
boom, run right after           
each other, no delay.           

894
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,419
Then there was a delay          
while we went and               

895
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,055
got the URL content.            

896
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,923
That could be a long delay.     

897
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,859
That could be minute or         
more if it was a big file over  

898
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,227
cellular or                     
something like that.            

899
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,331
So this line of code, c,        
you have to be careful.         

900
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,300
It could happen much later,     
and by the time it happens,     

901
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,469
you might not even              
care anymore.                   

902
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,638
If you had a really slow        
network and a big file,         

903
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,341
by the time it came back,       
the user, they're like,         

904
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,476
I don't even care about it.     

905
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,512
So you, when you come back      
to line c right there,          

906
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,014
you better check and make sure  
that you still even care.       

907
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,118
Make sense?                     

908
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,754
All right, next thing that      
happens is we wanna do some UI  

909
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,356
stuff with the data             
we got back.                    

910
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,524
But of course to do that,       

911
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,993
we have to dispatch             
to the main queue.              

912
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,062
This line of code, line d,      

913
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:45,034
also returns immediately        
because it's async dispatch.    

914
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,804
All it's doing is putting that  
closure onto the main queue.    

915
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,073
So this is the next line        
of code that executes.          

916
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,677
Notice line e has               
not executed yet.               

917
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,213
Line f executes and it just     
says I did some stuff with      

918
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,448
the data, but the UI            
part hasn't happened yet.       

919
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,319
I put it on the queue, but      
it hasn't been executed yet     

920
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:04,854
by the main queue.              

921
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:10,893
And then finally the UI         
stuff gets pulled off           

922
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:14,163
the main queue and executed.    

923
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,300
Did everyone understand         
that process?                   

924
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,903
So to summarize, its a,         
b, g, h, c, d, f, e.            

925
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,973
Now this thing about this,      

926
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,944
there's actually not            
necessarily exactly this way.   

927
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,914
Because when you dispatch       
things to the main queue from   

928
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:35,651
the main queue,                 
they could run right away.      

929
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,087
So it is possible that e        
could happen before f.          

930
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,423
But if this was on some other   
queue besides the main queue,   

931
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,659
it's very unlikely that         
e could happen before f.        

932
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,762
But it even could then          
because the main queue has so   

933
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,363
much priority that when you     
dispatch something onto it,     

934
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,534
the system might immediately    
go and try and process it.      

935
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,269
That's how high priority        
the main queue is.              

936
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,738
So it's possible that e         
could happen before f.          

937
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,674
But I just want you to think    
conceptually that when you put  

938
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,911
something on the queue, you     
kind of put it on the queue,    

939
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,163
There might be other things on  
the main queue ahead of you.    

940
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,347
could happen later.             

941
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,650
So definitely wouldn't          
run right away then.            

942
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,087
So that's the timing            
of multithreaded.               

943
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,623
So let's go back to our         
Cassini code and make it so     

944
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,761
that it uses these queues to    
stop blocking the main thread   

945
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,464
and stop being all              
stuck like that.                

946
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:27,303
To do this is actually          
remarkably simple.              

947
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,671
We're just gonna go back        
to our imageViewController,     

948
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,874
this is the deadly              
line of code.                   

949
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,042
I even put a comment in for     

950
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,045
this line of code when I        
posted this last time so        

951
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,080
that you realize this is        
a terrible line of code.        

952
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,349
This line of code,              
if this is in, from now on,     

953
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,918
if you turn in homework with    
a line of code like this,       

954
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,520
you're gonna get major dings.   

955
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,656
Because one of the evaluation   
criteria now is gonna be no     

956
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,558
more blocking the main queue.   

957
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,960
You cannot block                
the main queue.                 

958
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,030
That's, that's an evaluation    
criteria of all the homework    

959
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,565
going forward and               
of your final project.          

960
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,836
All right, so we have this      
terrible thing, and we can't    

961
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,272
do this line of code like this  
cuz it blocks the main queue,   

962
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,340
so what are we gonna do?        

963
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:08,978
We're just simply gonna put     
this call on some other queue.  

964
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,182
And I'm gonna do that by just   
saying DispatchQueue.global,    

965
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,750
I'm gonna get a global,         

966
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,853
one of these global             
concurrent queues.              

967
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:22,224
And it's asking me for          
the quality of service.         

968
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,894
And the user initiated          
this request, but               

969
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:28,731
it's not interactive, so        
I'm gonna say userInitiated,    

970
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,499
the choices there.              

971
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:34,236
Now I've got the queue I want,  
and I'm just gonna              

972
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:37,807
asynchronously post this        
code that I wanna do,           

973
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:41,444
this code that blocks,          
onto that global queue.         

974
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,447
And at some point, that global  
queue is going to allocate      

975
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,183
a thread and grab this closure  
off it and start running.       

976
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,619
Now that's gonna happen         
pretty darn quick, but          

977
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,988
not necessarily instantly.      

978
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,289
So now I've solved              
the problem,                    

979
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,924
woo hoo,                        
it's off the main queue.        

980
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,560
No longer blocking the main     
queue because this,             

981
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:58,761
which is executed               
on the main queue,              

982
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,263
because all of this code        
is on the main queue.           

983
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,932
We're executing all of          
our codes generally on          

984
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,202
the main queue.                 

985
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,438
This returns immediately.       

986
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,842
It's async, so it immediately   
returns, it just puts that      

987
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,178
closure on the queue and        
returns immediately.            

988
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,381
So no blocking the main queue,  
excellent.                      

989
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,050
But you notice I got            
this little error here.         

990
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,252
Let's take a look at it,        
what's that thing?              

991
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:27,223
Yeah, reference to              
self inside a closure.          

992
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,258
You have to                     
explicitly put self so          

993
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,627
that you think about            
memory cycles.                  

994
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,233
And indeed, there is            
a bad memory cycle here.        

995
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,769
Because this closure, if you    
remember, this is happening     

996
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,672
because I clicked on Saturn or  
Cassini or Earth.               

997
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,943
And it went off, created        
an ImageViewController for me,  

998
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,045
and that ImageView Controller   
is being put on screen and      

999
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,481
it's going off to               
fetch this thing.               

1000
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,217
Now what if the user is like,   
I'm tired of waiting for        

1001
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:59,122
that Earth image, and they hit  
back, and go click on Saturn.   

1002
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:01,990
When they hit back,             

1003
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,161
what's supposed to happen to    
that ImageViewController?       

1004
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,331
Anyone?                         

1005
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,634
>> It's supposed to             
leave the heap, okay.           

1006
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:13,202
Because it was under            
navigation controllers on       

1007
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,269
the top and I hit back.         

1008
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,807
Whoo, toss it out,              
but can it leave?               

1009
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:20,809
No, because this closure        
is keeping it in                

1010
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:24,847
the heap even though I          
don't want this any more.       

1011
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,816
I went back because I'm         
now I'm going over to see       

1012
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:27,950
Saturn instead of Earth, so     

1013
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,118
I don't even want this          
Earth thing any more.           

1014
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,154
So this is a bad kind of        
memory cycle cuz this is gonna  

1015
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:36,959
keep that ImageViewController   
in memory, so that's bad.       

1016
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,394
So this doesn't                 
want to do this, so             

1017
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,297
we're gonna fix this            
one using weak self.            

1018
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,967
By the way, you know,           
I showed that you can do,       

1019
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:46,768
weak weak self equals self.     

1020
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,472
But I'm a personally a fan      
of when you're using weak on    

1021
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:50,806
self to just say weak self.     

1022
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,543
And all that does is inside     
of this closure, it make        

1023
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:59,381
self be an optional version     
of itself, cuz it's weak now.   

1024
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,518
So that means I have to do      
this because if I do finally    

1025
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,921
come back from this closure     
and the person has hit back,    

1026
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,558
then the ImageViewController    
is gonna have left the heap.    

1027
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:14,530
And so self with be nil,        
perfect, exactly what I want.   

1028
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,967
And if self is nil and I do     
this little optional chaining,  

1029
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,135
then this whole line of         
code is not gonna happen,       

1030
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,704
exactly what I want.            

1031
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,572
I do not want to create         
an image out of that            

1032
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:25,140
information that came back.     

1033
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,908
Because that                    
ImageViewController has         

1034
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,643
left the heap.                  

1035
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,613
So here I've broken this        
memory cycle beautifully here.  

1036
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,715
Now, this does                  
beg the question,               

1037
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,319
surprised no one has            
raised their hand.              

1038
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,988
How do I interrupt              
this closure?                   

1039
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,291
When I hit back, and that       
ImageViewController goes away,  

1040
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,360
and I'm not interested          
in Earth any more,              

1041
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:48,597
I'm still finishing the fetch,  
of Earth.                       

1042
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,833
And the answer is,              
you can't stop a closure        

1043
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,703
that's been put on a queue,     
you cannot stop it.             

1044
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:58,173
The only way it can stop        
is if it quits itself.          

1045
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,843
So it could be looking at some  
global state to see if it's     

1046
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:01,977
still relevant.                 

1047
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,879
And if it sees,                 
I'm not relevant anymore,       

1048
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,081
it could return.                

1049
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,215
So if it was doing some         
long running thing.             

1050
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,417
Could do that.                  

1051
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:11,220
Or you can use something        
like NSUrlSession               

1052
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:14,089
which is really smart about     
going and getting URLs.         

1053
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,691
And it knows how to             
be interrupted and              

1054
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,593
all the things like that.       

1055
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,062
So you could do something a     
little smarter than just this   

1056
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,096
one line of code.               

1057
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:24,300
But once this goes on           
the queue, it, it's gonna run.  

1058
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,039
So it's up to it to             
decide not to run.              

1059
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,008
So we fix that problem of it,   
but                             

1060
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,677
there's still more              
problems in here.               

1061
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:41,283
What happens if this            
takes a minute,                 

1062
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:45,053
or ten minutes because          
slow network or whatever.       

1063
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,823
And we get back and             
in the meantime,                

1064
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:51,527
someone called this on          
my ImageViewController.         

1065
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,095
Now, our Cassini                
can't do that, but              

1066
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:54,262
you could imagine an app that   

1067
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,632
would be showing something      
in the ImageViewController.     

1068
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,433
And then you click              
on something in                 

1069
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:02,004
the ImageViewController itself  
and it shows a different URL.   

1070
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:04,607
So someone calls this.          

1071
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,810
If I call this again,           
it's gonna go down here and     

1072
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:11,380
fetchImage again, which is      
here, and it's gonna dispatch   

1073
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,350
another closure off to          
go get the new image.           

1074
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,754
So now there's two closures     
out there fetching.             

1075
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,223
Now what happen when            
the first one comes back?       

1076
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,458
What do I wanna do              
with that image?                

1077
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,760
Ignore it.                      

1078
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,095
Because the person said         
they want a new one.            

1079
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,566
So I better put something in    
here after this comes back to   

1080
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,902
see if I even care about        
that anymore, which is easy.    

1081
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:40,910
I could just say for example    
image == self?.imageURL.        

1082
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,080
So I'm sorry url                
== self?.imageURL.              

1083
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,916
So I'm just gonna look at this  
url, which is right here,       

1084
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,819
got captured by this closure.   

1085
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,454
This closure has                
captured this url.              

1086
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:56,825
I'm just gonna check if         
that url equals whatever        

1087
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,627
our current url is.             

1088
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,464
And if, if I'm not there,       
then it's okay.                 

1089
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,399
It's gonna be nil.              
So if I can equal nil, and      

1090
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:04,533
there we go.                    

1091
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,502
So here I just put a little     
test in there to make           

1092
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,771
sure that I'm still             
interested in that URL.         

1093
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,674
Can everyone understand         
what's going on here,           

1094
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,508
where url = imageURL,           

1095
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:18,247
this is a constant, a constant  
that got captured here.         

1096
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,383
So i's always gonna be          
the URL that we went and        

1097
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,952
got the contents of.            

1098
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,124
Ther's yet                      
another problem here.           

1099
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,226
Can anyone tell me another      
problem with this code,         

1100
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,127
obvious problem?                

1101
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,164
I just showed you               
in the slides.                  

1102
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,232
This right here,                

1103
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:43,139
self?.image is gonna            
call this code down here.       

1104
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,175
That's gonna do all             
kinds of UI stuff.              

1105
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,344
It's gonna set                  
the scrollView's content size,  

1106
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,480
size of the imageView,          
size of the imageView's image.  

1107
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,481
This is all UI stuff.           

1108
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,317
Where does that                 
need to happen?                 

1109
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,185
On the main queue.              

1110
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,422
And is this on the main         
queue right here?               

1111
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:05,027
No, this is on this queue       
over here, this global queue,   

1112
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,495
userInitiated global queue.     

1113
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,031
That's where this is            
all happening, so               

1114
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,000
that's not the main queue.      

1115
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,302
So that is illegal.             

1116
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,671
That's gonna cause all kinds    
of weird behavior in your app   

1117
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,304
if you do that.                 

1118
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,275
But easily fitched, fixed,      

1119
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:24,479
we'll just ditch                
DispatchQueue.main.async and    

1120
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,850
put this back on                
the main queue.                 

1121
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:35,824
Now what's really cool          
about this syntax,              

1122
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:40,896
I guess you would say,          
of doing these things is        

1123
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:46,502
it looks very much              
logically like normal code.     

1124
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,705
Right, it's almost just         
like if thens or whatever.      

1125
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,675
However, you do have to         
understand that when you do     

1126
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,577
a dispatch like this, that's    
gonna happen asynchronously.    

1127
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,113
It's gonna happen               
in a different time             

1128
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,482
than the rest of this code.     

1129
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:01,584
Same thing with this one.       

1130
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:02,351
This is gonna happen            
a little different time.        

1131
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,319
Now of course, things           

1132
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,720
that you put on the main queue  
tend to run pretty quick.       

1133
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:10,992
But even so, you just have to   
be cognizant of the fact that   

1134
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,495
even though it looks like this  
line of code is gonna happen,   

1135
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,497
then this line, then this       
line, then this line,           

1136
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,798
then this line,                 
it's not gonna happen.          

1137
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,400
It's gonna happen more          
like the slides, right,         

1138
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,270
where things happen a little    
bit out of order there          

1139
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,205
because things are happening    
asynchronously.                 

1140
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,474
Async means asynchronously,     
out of time,                    

1141
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:30,078
right, different,               
not lined up in time.           

1142
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:30,980
Everybody got that?             

1143
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,316
Let's see if that fixes         
all our problems.               

1144
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,189
So remember,                    
here we have no image.          

1145
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,692
By the way, this is a terrible  
problem right here where this   

1146
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,394
comes up blank.                 

1147
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,763
And I actually mentioned        
last week that I was gonna      

1148
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,765
make it extra credit for        
you to figure out how to not    

1149
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,666
make this blank in your         
calculator, have it             

1150
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,069
come up with the calculator     
instead of an empty graph.      

1151
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:56,004
But I decided instead I'm       
gonna show you how to           

1152
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:56,838
do it today.                    

1153
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:57,772
That's why I didn't             

1154
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,574
make it extra credit            
in the assignment.              

1155
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,576
But anyway, so                  
here's the detail.              

1156
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,711
We haven't picked an image so   
it's blank.                     

1157
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,413
Now I'm gonna go back.          

1158
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,314
Here's our Cassini              
viewController.                 

1159
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,283
Now I'm gonna pick Earth,       
and it's loading up, but        

1160
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,085
I changed my mind.              

1161
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:12,187
Saturn, changed my mind.        

1162
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,823
I can change my                 
mind now because                

1163
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,892
those things are being          
fetched in some other thread.   

1164
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:20,328
Now if I wait long enough,      
they get it and return it.      

1165
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,062
So here I am.                   

1166
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:25,300
I have Cassini here.            

1167
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,871
If I go back and hit Earth,     
again, I give up.               

1168
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:34,476
Saturn, I'll wait, and          
we'll see if we get Saturn.     

1169
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,179
By the way, Saturn, this is     
kind of a weird, I don't think  

1170
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:39,914
Cassini took this photo here,   
this picture of the people.     

1171
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:43,986
But wait a minute,              
look at that, there's Saturn.   

1172
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,225
One thing about this app,       
though, that's kind of bad      

1173
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:53,429
is I click on this and          
I get this white screen.        

1174
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,998
Especially on a big image like  
this one we get this white      

1175
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,866
screen, it's white screen,      
it's white screen.              

1176
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,334
It's like what's                
happening in this app?          

1177
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,970
I don't even understand         
what's going on.                

1178
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,606
It would be really cool if      
I could give the user some      

1179
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,942
feedback about                  
what's happening.               

1180
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:11,479
Now this feedback might be      
something that says loading     

1181
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,248
dot dot dot dot or something.   

1182
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,350
But a really cool feedback      
when you're waiting for         

1183
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,185
something is a spinning,        
a little spinner.               

1184
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,054
Have you seen those spinners?   

1185
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,289
A lot of apps have this where   
there's a little spinner.       

1186
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,924
So let's add a spinner          
to our app so                   

1187
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,361
that when we click here,        
it's a little thing spinning    

1188
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,531
until an image appears,         
and then it goes away.          

1189
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,667
That turns out to be            
incredible easy to do,          

1190
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,470
because that's a common thing   
to want to do is to give        

1191
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,304
the user feedback.              

1192
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,573
Yes, I heard you and            
I'm working on it, but          

1193
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:39,475
I don't have it yet.            

1194
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,142
How do we do that?              

1195
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,845
Let's go back to                
our storyboard.                 

1196
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,881
And this is where we're gonna   
wanna do that is on this        

1197
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,617
viewController right here.      

1198
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:51,619
This is where our scrollView    
is with our little              

1199
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,021
imageView in there.             

1200
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,457
And what we can do is just      
go over over here and           

1201
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,191
get an object.                  

1202
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,594
It's called                     
an Activity Indicator View.     

1203
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,797
Here it is right here, view     
an Activity Indicator View.     

1204
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:05,333
And I'm just gonna              
drag this into my UI,           

1205
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,235
right in the middle.            

1206
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,305
Now what I just did there       
was a very bad thing.           

1207
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:14,476
It looked fine,                 
but it's very bad.              

1208
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,745
And it's a little subtle        
as to why it's bad, so          

1209
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,447
let's investigate this one in   
depth why this was bad that     

1210
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,682
I dragged that in there.        

1211
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,519
And the way we gonna see        
that it's bad is by bringing    

1212
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:27,121
out for the first time          
this document outline.          

1213
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,725
This little thing in the lower  
left which I told you we were   

1214
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,227
gonna talk about and            
here we are talking about it.   

1215
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:35,497
This is everything that's       
in our storyboard in            

1216
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:39,567
outline form,                   
in kind of text form.           

1217
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,303
And when we do this,            

1218
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,172
we look down here at this       
Activity Indicator View.        

1219
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:45,507
By the way,                     
if you select something here,   

1220
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,509
it'll select it here and        
vice versa.                     

1221
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:50,111
So this is selected, so         
it's showing it here.           

1222
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,114
And you see how these things,   
this is all the views, this is  

1223
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,452
the top level view, that's the  
view var in the controller.     

1224
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,022
Then here is that scrollView    
that we made, and               

1225
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,624
then here is                    
the indicator view.             

1226
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,460
We see how these are indented,  

1227
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,295
that means they                 
are subviews of each other.     

1228
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,499
So we made the gray             
activity indicator              

1229
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:14,936
a subview of our Scroll View,   
we do not want that here.       

1230
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,305
We want our Scroll View         
scrolling around our image,     

1231
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,075
we don't want it scrolling      
our indicator around.           

1232
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,777
We want the indicator           
to stay in the middle.          

1233
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:27,649
We don't want it to be          
a subview of Scroll View,       

1234
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,351
we want it to be a sibling.     

1235
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,352
We want them both to            
be at the same level,           

1236
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,954
one in front of the other.      

1237
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,291
And we can do that just by      
picking this up right here,     

1238
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,227
and moving it to the same       
level as Scroll View.           

1239
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:42,331
Now that's very hard to do in   
here because any time you try   

1240
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,333
to pick this up and move it,    
it's always gonna wanna try     

1241
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,303
and drop into a subview or      
a superview of something, so    

1242
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:50,372
it's always gonna               
grab on to it.                  

1243
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,540
But in this document            
outline it's very easy.         

1244
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:56,377
You can just pick it up and     
move it there.                  

1245
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,948
So when you do these activity   
indicator views in your future  

1246
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,883
apps and                        
in your final project,          

1247
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,952
make sure you don't             
accidentally make it a sub      

1248
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,988
view of something that          
you drag it onto.               

1249
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,088
If it what you intend.          

1250
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,990
Notice also the order           
matters here.                   

1251
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,159
This is the sub views           
in their, in order, and         

1252
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,561
remember that sub view sub      
zero is in the back, and        

1253
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,296
all the other ones              
are in the front.               

1254
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,466
So we obviously want this       
activity indicator to           

1255
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,535
be in the front,                
in front of everything.         

1256
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,437
All right, so that was that.    

1257
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:26,875
Now what we wanna do is we      
want to wire this activity      

1258
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,845
indicator right here            
up to our code.                 

1259
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,446
Why?                            
Because we have to tell it to   

1260
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:32,214
start running.                  

1261
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,648
Or actually even                
before we do that,              

1262
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,150
let's configure                 
it a little bit.                

1263
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,986
We've got it right here,        
we can inspect it.              

1264
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,689
Here's the inspector of it,     
see Activity Indicator View.    

1265
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:43,558
It looks kind of small          
to me for this big view.        

1266
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,259
So I'm gonna switch             
to a different kind             

1267
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,496
which is the Large White.       

1268
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:49,430
But I don't actually            
want it to be white             

1269
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,799
because the background          
is white.                       

1270
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:54,502
So I'm gonna change its         
color to be, Iet's say blue.    

1271
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,238
So this can be large and blue.  

1272
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,708
Also, every time I stop         
animating it, I want it to      

1273
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,143
hide itself, because I          
don't want it to be stopped     

1274
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,812
spinning, sitting               
there showing.                  

1275
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:06,448
Any time it stops I             
want it to disappear.           

1276
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:07,916
Then if I start it again,       
it'll reappear.                 

1277
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,284
So that's what this button is.  

1278
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:12,053
This here animating would       
mean that it would come up      

1279
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:12,921
animating, but                  

1280
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,124
I'm gonna turn it on any time   
I go do a background fetch.     

1281
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:19,727
So I don't want it to come      
up with this view animating     

1282
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:20,695
already.                        

1283
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:21,797
That's what those all mean.     

1284
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,532
To turn it on I need            
to talk to it, so               

1285
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,301
I need an outlet to it.         

1286
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,304
So I'm just gonna control drag  
from it, just like any other    

1287
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,706
outlet we would make to         
a button or whatever.           

1288
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,674
Here it is.                     

1289
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:35,344
I'm gonna call it a spinner,    
that's what I like to call      

1290
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:37,513
my UI activity indicators,      
spinner.                        

1291
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,982
There's my spinner              
outlet right there.             

1292
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:44,252
All I need to do here is turn   
this thing on whenever I        

1293
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:48,056
go off to another               
thread to do something.         

1294
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,992
So here's where I go off        
to another thread to do         

1295
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,497
something, so I'm just gonna    
say spinner.startAnimating.     

1296
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:56,765
And that's gonna                
start it spinning.              

1297
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,666
It's gonna unhide it,           
if it was hidden, and           

1298
00:58:58,735 --> 00:58:59,635
start it spinning.              

1299
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:01,470
Question?                       

1300
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,943
>> Animated just make           
thatlittle blue thing go round  

1301
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:09,545
It just makes it spin           
just like all spinners.         

1302
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,079
and round.                      

1303
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:15,884
>> Yeah, well,                  
when I inspected it over here.  

1304
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:18,987
And I did, and I didn't         
click this button Animating,    

1305
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,823
that just means it doesn't      
start out animating.            

1306
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,894
I have to start it in code,     
that's what this means.         

1307
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:26,794
If I turn this on,              

1308
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,030
then as soon as my app came     
up it would be animating,       

1309
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:29,831
which I don't want that.        

1310
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,700
I don't want it to start        
animating until I do this       

1311
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,636
dispatch onto                   
some other queue,               

1312
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,605
that's when I want it           
to start animating.             

1313
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,975
Now, you might imagine that     
the place to stop animating it  

1314
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,644
might be right here.            

1315
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:47,148
spinner.stopAnimating, but and  
this would kinda make sense.    

1316
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,419
Because you know, I went off    
to go get this image and        

1317
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,620
it came back, and               
I set the image.                

1318
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,923
Now I can stop animating.       

1319
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,492
But actually I don't            
wanna do that here.             

1320
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,895
And that is because I           
wanna stop animating            

1321
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,797
anytime the image is set.       

1322
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,466
If an image is set in my        
image view controller,          

1323
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,901
I wanna stop animating.         

1324
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,770
I don't care how it got set.    

1325
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:11,306
If it got set from my thing     
coming back, that's good.       

1326
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,174
If someone set it by saying,    

1327
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:17,379
image URL equals like a local   
URL, I wanna stop then too.     

1328
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,180
So I'm gonna put it             
down here an image.             

1329
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,615
Here's where we set our image.  

1330
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:22,450
This is the set part of it.     

1331
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,421
And I'm just gonna say          
down here, stopAnimating.       

1332
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,091
So, any time my image is set    
I'm gonna stop animating cuz    

1333
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,059
it would make no sense if       
the image was there and         

1334
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,727
the thing was animating.        

1335
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:33,895
That would never                
make sense for                  

1336
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,064
an image to be showing, and it  
to animate at the same time.    

1337
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,365
Because animating               

1338
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,034
this thing means I'm            
waiting for an image.           

1339
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:41,803
Got it?                         

1340
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,105
Touch it, that's all you have   
to do to do the spinners,       

1341
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,339
they're super, super simple.    

1342
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,342
They only makes sense when      
you're doing things in other    

1343
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,178
threads with the spinner.       

1344
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:53,614
Cuz if you're me, if you're     
not doing something in another  

1345
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,316
thread then why would you?      

1346
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,117
See, now look.                  

1347
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,586
This came up, it's blank but    
it's not spinning               

1348
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,422
because I haven't asked for     
anything yet.                   

1349
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,224
So I'll go back here and        
I'll ask for Earth.             

1350
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,894
It says nil while               
doing Optional value.           

1351
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:06,627
That's not bad.                 

1352
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,896
What happened here?             

1353
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,299
Ahh, yeah, good one.            

1354
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,433
All right, so this crashed.     

1355
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,634
Why did this crash?             

1356
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,770
Why did we have                 
a problem here?                 

1357
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:20,809
And the answer here             
is that when I set              

1358
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:25,747
this image I was in prepare.    

1359
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:31,486
And when I'm in prepare,        
my outlets are not set.         

1360
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:36,792
So I need to optional           
chain that right there.         

1361
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,393
So this crash,                  
you'll get it yourself a lot,   

1362
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:42,930
where you prepare               
something and crash.            

1363
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,833
It crashes during prepare       
because you try to set          

1364
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:46,568
your outlets.                   

1365
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,537
Now, this is fine for           
the spinner not to be set, and  

1366
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:53,007
I'm setting the image because   
I never would have started it   

1367
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,609
in this condition anyway.       

1368
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:59,247
So all is well just to ignore   
setting the image when I'm      

1369
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:00,382
preparing.                      

1370
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,385
Everybody got that one?         

1371
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:07,389
You all have that, hundreds     
of times in your iOS careers    

1372
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,458
where you have some code        
that you'll prepare,            

1373
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,393
execute that uses an outlet.    

1374
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,162
All right, so let's go          
back now, we hit Earth.         

1375
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,263
See it's spinning.              

1376
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:18,833
As soon as the image gets put   
in here, it stops spinning,     

1377
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,401
all right, it's gone.           

1378
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,537
Okay, back here, spinning.      

1379
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:23,605
Yeah, we don't want it.         

1380
01:02:23,674 --> 01:02:27,642
Let's go here, skip it here.    

1381
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,083
Now, the last thing I wanna     
do is this thing where,         

1382
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,586
when the thing starts           
up it starts up blank.          

1383
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,058
All right, it starts blank      
because it's on the detail.     

1384
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,526
And I don't want                
it on the detail                

1385
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,230
when there's no                 
image URL there.                

1386
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:52,133
I want it to start up here if,  
when I first start.             

1387
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,368
All right, so                   
how do I do that?               

1388
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:57,772
I'm gonna do that using         
the split view controllers.     

1389
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,575
If we go look at our            
storyboard here.                

1390
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:03,311
I'm gonna use the delegate      
of this split                   

1391
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,613
view controller right here.     

1392
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:09,784
Because this split view         
controller asks the delegate,   

1393
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:14,890
would you like to do the job    
of collapsing the primary       

1394
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,524
view, the secondary             
view controller rather,         

1395
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:19,694
you know the detail,            
on top of the master?           

1396
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,764
Okay, so it's gonna give me     
the opportunity to do that.     

1397
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,868
And what I'm gonna do is, if    
there's no image URL in there,  

1398
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:30,104
I'm gonna say I did it but      
I'm not gonna do anything.      

1399
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,774
And that's gonna cause it       
not to collapse the detail      

1400
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:33,742
on top of the master.           

1401
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:38,613
Now, I need to have one of my   
view controllers be the split   

1402
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,482
view controller's delegate.     

1403
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,684
And I can't really have         
it be this one right here       

1404
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,720
because this one comes and      
goes.                           

1405
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:46,921
This is the Image View          
Controller. It gets created     

1406
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,024
when it's segued to and         
when you go away, it stops.     

1407
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,359
You go throw it                 
out of the heap.                

1408
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,662
So I can't have my split view   
controller's delegate thrown    

1409
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,364
out of the heap all the time,   
so                              

1410
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,534
instead I'm going to have this  
view controller be my split     

1411
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,436
view controller's delegate.     

1412
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:03,971
So here we go.                  

1413
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,507
Here's my                       
CassiniViewController.          

1414
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,477
Now where is a good place to    
set yourself as your own split  

1415
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,779
view controller's delegate?     

1416
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,214
You could probably              
do it in view and               

1417
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,883
load and that would work.       

1418
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:15,983
But I think a better,           

1419
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,153
safer place to do               
it is awakeFromNib.             

1420
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,522
Cuz awakeFromNib if             
you remember from from          

1421
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,192
the ViewController life         
cycle is called really early    

1422
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:25,226
in the game.                    

1423
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:31,065
So if I wanna set my own        
splitViewController's           

1424
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:34,236
delegate to myself, delegate.   

1425
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,040
This is really early            
time to do it.                  

1426
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,876
Now notice here                 
that I'm taking my              

1427
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:44,111
own splitViewController         
which might be nil,             

1428
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,980
because I might not be in       
a splitViewController.          

1429
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,283
And I'm setting its             
delegate to myself.             

1430
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,819
Remember, every                 
ViewController has this bar     

1431
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,522
splitViewController which       
is the splitViewController,     

1432
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:55,589
it's in if it is in one.        

1433
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,259
And so                          
I'm getting an error here,      

1434
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,761
anyone know what                
this error is?                  

1435
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,898
Nobody?                         

1436
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:07,835
It says that you can not        
assign a CassiniViewController  

1437
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,806
to be a                         
UISplitViewControllerDelegate.  

1438
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,743
You can't make this equal       
this, that's because this is    

1439
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:17,712
CassiniViewController is        
not a UISplitViewDelegate.      

1440
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:21,516
UISplitViewControllerDelegate.  

1441
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,853
We have to say that it's a      
UISplitViewControllerDelegate.  

1442
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:30,258
Okay, once we say that,         
that resolves this error.       

1443
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,027
All the methods in that         
protocol are optional.          

1444
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,896
So, we've satisfied             
the protocol,                   

1445
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,964
which is kinda weird.           

1446
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,833
But now we can implement        
any of the ones we want.        

1447
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:39,734
Here's a trick for you.         

1448
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,836
If you want,                    
if you're a delegate and        

1449
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,872
you wanna find out              
what methods are,               

1450
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:46,474
just start typing               
the name of the class.          

1451
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:47,642
So here's splitView and         

1452
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,044
here's all the                  
splitViewControllerDelegates.   

1453
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,512
You have to have done           
this part first.                

1454
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,515
You have to say you're          
a delegate first.               

1455
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,750
Once you do that, it's gonna    
show all these, right,          

1456
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,085
these are all the things        
splitViewDelegate can do.       

1457
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,189
And we want this one            
right here at the top.          

1458
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,990
CollapseSecondary onto          
primary.                        

1459
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,558
So I'm gonna                    
double-click that.              

1460
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:09,497
I'll show you these arguments   
a little easier to see if I do  

1461
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:10,231
this.                           

1462
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:20,141
That and then this one.         

1463
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,176
So this                         
splitViewControllerDelegate     

1464
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,712
method has three arguments,     
one is the sender,              

1465
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,181
that's the splitViewController  
asking you.                     

1466
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,851
Here, it's asking               
me please collapse              

1467
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:33,888
this secondaryViewController,   
that's a detail onto            

1468
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,824
this primaryViewController      
that's the master.              

1469
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:40,561
So this what happens when we    
first start up, a blank detail  

1470
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:44,465
gets put on top of the master,  
and we don't want that.         

1471
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:48,770
But we only don't want that     
if that detail is blank.        

1472
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:54,074
So I'm gonna go here and say    
if the PrimaryViewController    

1473
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:57,112
is myself, because if the       
PrimaryViewController is not    

1474
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,413
myself, then the things         
are gone weird here,            

1475
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,214
but it should be.               

1476
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:03,717
So I'm gonna say if the         
PrimaryViewController.conte-    

1477
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:07,856
nts, because I might be in      
navigation controller equals    

1478
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:10,425
myself, remember contents       
is this thing down here.        

1479
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:12,860
So, I'm doing that there.       

1480
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:16,497
Then I say if I can let         
the ImageViewController equal   

1481
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:20,334
the secondaryViewController,    
that's the detail.              

1482
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,636
It's this argument right here.  

1483
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,803
It can pass to me,              

1484
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,509
it's the thing that is asking   
me to collapse on top of it.    

1485
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:31,545
SecondaryViewController as      
an ImageViewController.         

1486
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,448
And again here,                 
I wanna do contents.            

1487
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,518
So that's inside                
the NavigationController.       

1488
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:38,853
But that's not all.             

1489
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:41,488
It's not just if I have         
an ImageViewController being    

1490
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,157
asked to collapse               
on top of me.                   

1491
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,795
But I wanna make sure           
that that IVC's imageURL.       

1492
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:51,399
Equals nil.                     

1493
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,402
So if splitViewController's     
asking me to collapse           

1494
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:57,538
an ImageViewController          
that has a blank image,         

1495
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:02,043
I'm going to return true        
to say, yep, I did it.          

1496
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:03,511
But I'm not actually            
going to do anything.           

1497
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,713
Because I don't want            
that to happen.                 

1498
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:09,250
So I'm kinda faking out this    
splitViewController there.      

1499
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,419
Otherwise I'm gonna return      
false, which means, no,         

1500
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:14,155
I couldn't do this collapse,    
so you do it.                   

1501
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:19,093
Now the splitViewController     
will do it itself.              

1502
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:23,431
So it's kinda funky, but I      
just wanted to show you this,   

1503
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,734
to show you that there are a    
little more complicated ways    

1504
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,469
to do things then               
I sometimes show.               

1505
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:29,304
But look what happened.         

1506
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:35,043
I ran and I did not get         
that blank VieController.       

1507
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,611
Because I told                  
splitViewController             

1508
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,480
that I collapsed it on there,   
but I didn't really so          

1509
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:40,448
it did nothing.                 

1510
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,250
But if I click on one now the   
image url is not nil and so     

1511
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,019
it did do the collapse for me.  

1512
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,659
All right, so that's it.        

1513
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:56,498
Let's get back to our slides    
and do our last topic here.     

1514
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,135
Which is our text field.        

1515
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,636
So I'm just gonna throw         
in text field in here,          

1516
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:06,507
cuz you're, it's going to be    
included in our next demo and   

1517
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:10,077
in your next assignment, it's   
a pretty easy little class,     

1518
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,278
UITextField.                    

1519
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,113
It's very similar to UILabel.   

1520
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,549
The difference is               
it's editable.                  

1521
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,553
UILabel, if you touch on it,    
nothing happens.                

1522
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,321
But you do UITextField,         
if you touch on it,             

1523
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,858
a little blinking cursor        
happens and the keyboard will   

1524
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,361
come up from the bottom, and    
you can use your thumbs and     

1525
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,630
type, or, if you have an iPad   
with a physical keyboard,       

1526
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,732
you could type or whatever.     

1527
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,135
That's all the UITextField is.  

1528
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:36,871
Now because it's editable,      
it's got some little            

1529
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,440
intricacies that are quite      
a bit different than UILabel.   

1530
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,076
It still has things             
like attributed text,           

1531
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,312
and you can set the font,       
and all these things,           

1532
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,848
because it's very much like     
a UILabel in that way.          

1533
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:51,285
But there's this keyboard,      
okay, when you are in           

1534
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:56,391
UITextField and you touch on    
it, it brings up a keyboard.    

1535
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:59,294
So how does that keyboard       
show and not show?              

1536
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:03,431
Well, the keyboard shows        
any time, any view,             

1537
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,501
in the view hierarchy,          
becomes the first responder or  

1538
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:07,701
what's called                   
the first responder.            

1539
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,072
And the first responder means   
it wants to be the thing that   

1540
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,807
gets key events                 
from the keyboard,              

1541
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:16,343
it's the first responder for    
key events.                     

1542
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,947
You can make your UITextField   
start it cursor blinking and    

1543
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,684
make the keyboard come up by    
sending it the message become   

1544
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,418
first responder.                

1545
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,721
If you tell your UITextField    
to become the first responder,  

1546
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:27,888
the keyboard will appear, so    

1547
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:30,758
that's how you make             
the keyboard up here.           

1548
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,494
And similarly if you want       
the keyboard to go away and     

1549
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,564
the blinking caret to go away,  
say resignFirstResponder        

1550
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,534
to the TextField that is the    
current first responder and     

1551
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,434
it will go away.                

1552
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,136
So that's how you               
control the keyboard.           

1553
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:45,406
UITextField has a delegate.     

1554
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,641
It has about actually           
ten delegate methods.           

1555
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,710
Can do quite a lot of           
interesting things.             

1556
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:53,213
For example, when the keyboard  
comes up, most keyboards,       

1557
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,516
have a Return key in            
the lower right hand corner.    

1558
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,919
And when you hit                
that Return key,                

1559
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,487
you get this delegate method.   

1560
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,723
Text field show return,         
it returns a bool.              

1561
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,158
It's basically saying,          

1562
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,094
should I do what I normally     
do when you press Return?       

1563
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,162
Because text fields             
are also controls,              

1564
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,398
they can do target action.      

1565
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:13,033
So it's kind of                 
asking you here,                

1566
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,602
should I do target              
action today?                   

1567
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:17,204
You know, some control          
dragged to an IBaction,         

1568
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,539
should I send that?             

1569
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,908
It's what it's asking here      
what should I return.           

1570
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,911
But one thing you can do and    
should return you might return  

1571
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,781
yes, but you might also         
resignFirstResponder.           

1572
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,015
Because when it hits Return,    

1573
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,283
you want the keyboard           
to go away.                     

1574
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:31,318
Because otherwise               
the keyboard will not go away   

1575
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,553
when it hits Return.            

1576
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,821
Even if you have                
target action,                  

1577
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,290
it's not gonna make             
that keyboard go away.          

1578
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,826
It's very common that you       
wanna implement a text          

1579
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:39,726
field delegate,                 

1580
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,630
just to make the keyboard go    
away when you hit Return.       

1581
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,235
What other delegate methods     
does a TextField have?          

1582
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:51,405
You can find out every time     
it resigns first responder.     

1583
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,174
It will send its delegate       
the method didEndEditing.       

1584
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,944
So this is a good way to find   
out, I'd better get the text    

1585
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,113
out of there and                
go do something with it.        

1586
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:01,449
Because someone hit Return, or  

1587
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,785
did something that caused       
resignFirstResponder to happen  

1588
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,787
so this method                  
gets sent to you.               

1589
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:08,956
In fact, this is probably       
a more common way to            

1590
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,524
get the text out                
of a text field                 

1591
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:14,461
then target/action is to        
implement its delegate.         

1592
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:18,265
And in end editing you get      
the text out of there.          

1593
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,500
Or you could even grab it       

1594
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,536
out of there in should          
return if you want.             

1595
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,138
So text field is a control.     

1596
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,207
You can do target action,       
just Ctrl drag.                 

1597
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,510
It has certain events that can  
cause target action to happen   

1598
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:30,611
just like a button actually.    

1599
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,513
And you can right click on a    
text field in a storyboard to   

1600
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,416
see what it can do there.       

1601
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:39,052
The keyboard, you can change    
the kind of keyboard.           

1602
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,056
The keyboard, for example,      
there's a keyboard for          

1603
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,525
entering URLs, and it's got     
a button on there, .com.        

1604
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,794
I think it even has a button,   
HTTP so                         

1605
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,431
that you can quickly            
enter a URL.                    

1606
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,733
There's another URL which       
is like a phone dialer,         

1607
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,369
which is the keypad, or         
another, a keypad rather.       

1608
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,704
It's like a phone dialer, so    

1609
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,772
it just has the numbers or      
whatever.                       

1610
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,174
So you can specify that.        

1611
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:01,942
And the way you specify         
those things is you             

1612
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:05,379
don't send any messages         
to any keyboard object.         

1613
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,981
You send it to any object that  
is using the keyboard that      

1614
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,584
implements the protocol         
UITextInputTraits.              

1615
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,988
UITextInputTraits is            
a protocol that has             

1616
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,924
all these things                
shown here in it and            

1617
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:20,594
when you send it to             
something like a text field     

1618
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:24,265
it configures its               
keyboard to match that.         

1619
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,802
If you want auto correction     
in your text field,             

1620
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:30,671
where you're typing and         
you're mistyping, and           

1621
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,940
it's autocorrecting as you go,  
you can get that.               

1622
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,610
Just set your auto correction   
type there to .yes in your      

1623
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:37,477
text field.                     

1624
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:40,081
So you're sending these,        
these vars are on text field.   

1625
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:44,184
But they're on text field       
because text field implements   

1626
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,554
the UITextInputTraits           
protocol.                       

1627
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,356
And you can do secure text for  

1628
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,059
passwords and                   
all that kind of stuff.         

1629
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,527
In other words, if you're       
looking to control your         

1630
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,830
keyboard, don't look            
in text field per se,           

1631
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,965
go look at this                 
UITextInputTrait protocol, and  

1632
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,635
you'll see what you can do for  
your keyboard.                  

1633
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:04,204
You can also set an accessory   
view in your keyboard,          

1634
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,942
a little view along the top of  
your keyboard that is just for  

1635
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,009
your app.                       

1636
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:09,677
That's kind of fun.             

1637
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:10,811
You just, again,                

1638
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,347
just TextInputTraits            
protocol thing.                 

1639
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:15,783
One thing about the keyboard,   

1640
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:19,086
I'm actually not gonna talk     
about this because of time.     

1641
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,555
We'll talk about this           
in a later lecture.             

1642
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,124
But the keyboard when it comes  
up it actually covers up        

1643
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,426
your views.                     

1644
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,161
So you better make sure that    
text field is not underneath    

1645
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,230
the keyboard.                   

1646
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,965
Otherwise keyboard              
will come up and                

1647
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,500
people will not be able         
to type in your text.           

1648
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,969
And I see a lot of final        
projects that do this,          

1649
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:36,603
where you have                  
your nice UI and                

1650
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,206
you've got a lot of             
text fields on there.           

1651
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:41,975
And you've got some text        
fields towards the bottom of    

1652
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,545
the screen and when I try to    
run your app and do it and      

1653
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,814
I click it, I am running        
it on a real device,            

1654
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,984
there's no keyboard I can't     
type in the simulator.          

1655
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,653
One thing about when you're     
doing text field, be careful    

1656
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:55,222
because in the simulator you    
can just type on the keyboard.  

1657
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,892
But in the real world           
the keyboard's gonna slide out  

1658
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,360
from the bottom.                

1659
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,962
So students often will do       
their final projects do         

1660
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,297
the whole thing                 
in the simulator.               

1661
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,732
They only barely do it on       
the device even though that's   

1662
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,601
absolutely required for         
your final project by the way.  

1663
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,004
And they turn it in and bam     
they get dinged pretty hard     

1664
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,607
because I can't use their app.  

1665
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,176
Because this keyboard comes up  
and covers up the text fields   

1666
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:19,279
that they're wanting            
me to enter text into.          

1667
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,249
The way you find out            
about the keyboard and          

1668
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:24,819
where it came over is           
using these observers.          

1669
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,387
And you're basically gonna      
observe the window, and         

1670
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,724
the window is gonna send you    
this little notification that   

1671
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:33,527
says, hey, keyboard just came   
up, and in the notification     

1672
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:34,962
that's sent to you,             
there's gonna be information    

1673
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,032
about the rectangle that the    
keyboard used to cover you,     

1674
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,402
and you have to move            
your UI out of the way.         

1675
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:44,338
Hopefully you're in a           
scrollable thing like a table   

1676
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:46,440
view or just a scroll view.     

1677
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:49,643
But if not then you just gotta  
move, set the frame of your     

1678
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:52,713
super view or something         
to move that thing up.          

1679
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:54,548
Because it's your               
responsibility to make sure     

1680
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,617
that the keyboard is not        
covering something that's       

1681
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:57,585
necessarily to user UI.         

1682
01:15:57,654 --> 01:16:01,288
So when you're doing            
your final projects             

1683
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:03,891
do it on a device.              

1684
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,993
Otherwise you are very likely   
to run into this problem.       

1685
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,762
So we'll talk about             
these observers,                

1686
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,430
these notification sender and   
stuff in a future lecture.      

1687
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:13,600
There's other text              
field properties not            

1688
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,637
related to the keyboard, like   
it does the auto shrinking and  

1689
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,405
all that stuff that we          
saw with UI labels so           

1690
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,841
you can control that            
stuff with text field.          

1691
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,945
I'll let you look at the doc    
to figure all that stuff out.   

1692
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,949
Text fields also have a little  
right and left accessory view.  

1693
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:31,852
These little overviews for      
like a search button.           

1694
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:35,456
Or little, you can put little   
exclamation points in there,    

1695
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:36,757
things like that.               

1696
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:37,825
So you can look for             
that as well.                   

1697
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,661
That's it.                      

1698
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,863
On Wednesday I'm                
gonna do TableView.             

1699
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,999
Big old lecture with            
a big old demo.                 

1700
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:46,433
And that's what your            
homework's gonna be about.      

1701
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:49,569
Friday, we have a section       
it's going to be on             

1702
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,406
CollectionView which I'd love   
to teach in main lecture        

1703
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:53,940
because it's really             
an important class.             

1704
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,177
It's very much like             
TableView but more flexible,    

1705
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,246
a little more powerful          
than TableView.                 

1706
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,914
You kind of need to             
know TableView first,           

1707
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:02,483
that's why we do TableView      
on Wednesday and                

1708
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,418
then the CollectionView         
on Friday.                      

1709
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,987
Then next week I'll be doing    
the object oriented database,   

1710
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,556
called Core Data, and you'll    
be integrating that into your   

1711
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,959
assignment 4 to make            
your assignment 5.              

1712
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,594
That's it, see you then.        

1713
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:25,572
