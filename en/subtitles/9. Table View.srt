00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,109
>> All right, well,             
welcome to Stanford CS193P,     

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,946
Developing Applications for     
iOS, winter of 2017.            

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,183
This is Lecture number 9.       

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,786
And today we have only one      
topic which is Table View.      

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,187
And I'm gonna go through a      
bunch of slides to talk about   

8
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:23,989
the concepts of it.             

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,992
And then we're gonna            
have a humongous demo           

10
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,360
that we're gonna build          
a Twitter client and            

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,296
it's gonna use Table View and   

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,532
some other things that we've    
learned, like Text Field.       

13
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,835
And Table View, what is it?     

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,739
You've seen a Table View        
in all sorts of iOS apps.       

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,908
It's just this UI where         
there's a list of things.       

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,879
There's really two different    
kinds of looks to Table View.   

17
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,479
There's the kind                
on the left there,              

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,648
which we call plain style.      

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,818
Plain style is just             
a list of things.               

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,721
And it might be collected into  
groups like little sections.    

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,291
But it's mostly just            
a big long list.                

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,660
On the right side,              
is called a grouped style.      

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,230
Where the sections              
in the table,                   

24
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,934
you're more obviously           
disconnected from each other.   

25
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,436
They have you know,             
big gaps in between.            

26
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:17,943
Normally the plain style        
we use for dynamic data.        

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,445
Data that might have any        
number of items in there.       

28
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,580
The group style we tend         
to use for static data,         

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,050
where we know exactly what      
rows are gonna be in there,     

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,120
and exactly what's              
gonna be in them.               

31
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,289
So let's talk about the names   
of all the parts of             

32
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,558
a Table View, so that as        
I'm explaining all this,        

33
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,461
you'll know what                
the terminology is.             

34
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,230
First we have a table header.   

35
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,363
That's a UIView.                

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,999
There's only one of them.       

37
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,135
It sits at the very             
top of the table.               

38
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,902
This is where,                  
as you'll see in the demo,      

39
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,040
you might put a search field    
or something that searches      

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,009
to find what's in your table    
or something like that.         

41
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,478
And similarly,                  
there's a footer view.          

42
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,513
Rarely see this used.           

43
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,749
But it's just a UIView          
that sits at the bottom         

44
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,301
And in between, there are       
these things called sections.   

45
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,786
of the table.                   

46
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,989
So a section is just            
a combination of a header and   

47
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,857
a footer,                       
which are usually strings, but  

48
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,460
also could be UIViews, and      
then any number of rows.        

49
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,728
That's what we call a section.  

50
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,397
So that's a section             
right there.                    

51
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,667
This is the section header for  
the two sections that I have    

52
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,537
showing in this table, right,   
where it says Header 0.         

53
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,705
And these are sections          
footers for                     

54
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,440
the two sections that I have.   

55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,310
These two sections happen to    
both have the same numbers of   

56
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,113
rows in each which is two but   
a section, one section have     

57
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:31,583
a 100 rows, and one could have  
just 1, it's perfectly fine.    

58
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:36,521
This right in here,             
we call a table cell.           

59
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,023
C-E-L-L, cell, and              
it's the UIView,                

60
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,692
actually UITableViewCell,       

61
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,495
it's the name of the subclass   
that's in there.                

62
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,731
And this is the thing that's    
gonna draw the data that's at   

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,799
a particular row.               

64
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,467
And we're gonna see             
how that works.                 

65
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,203
By the way, along the bottom    
you're seeing source code that  

66
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,005
kind of corresponds             
with these things.              

67
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,075
Don't worry I'm gonna get back  
to showing you all that stuff   

68
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:57,976
in later slides.                

69
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,145
So this is the naming we use    
to name all the parts of        

70
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,014
a table view.                   

71
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,148
And this is in plain style.     

72
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,618
All the same names              
work in group style.            

73
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,519
Everything just kinda           
looks a little different.       

74
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,088
All right,                      
still have a header, footer,    

75
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,123
sections, all the same.         

76
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,059
Just a little                   
different UI look.              

77
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,930
Now, tables can have            
sections or not.                

78
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,832
You don't have to               
have any sections, so           

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,003
the table on the left is just   
a whole list of cities and      

80
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,205
the countries they're in and    
just a big long list.           

81
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,307
On the right is kind of         
the same kind of list but       

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,943
you can see that they're        
grouped into sections there by  

83
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:32,811
country, right.                 

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,213
So Japan there, Mexico, etc.    

85
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,248
So sections are optional,       

86
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,318
not optional in the case        
of an option, but               

87
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,856
sections you can have them or   
not, it's totally up to you.    

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,096
The type of the cell,           
like each row, there are four   

89
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,432
kinda pre-defined types and     
then there's a custom type.     

90
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,969
The four pre-defined types are  
subtitle where you just got     

91
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:58,737
like a title and                

92
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,773
a little smaller text           
subtitle under it.              

93
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,575
There's default which           
is the same except              

94
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,644
there's no little               
subtitle thing.                 

95
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,179
There's value 1 and value 2,    
which is just like subtitle,    

96
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,715
it's just that the little       
thing underneath is in          

97
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,218
a different spot,               
it's either blue and            

98
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,588
to the left or it's kind of     
grayed off into the right but   

99
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,326
i's just how i's laying out     
the basic information there.    

100
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,995
Now a custom cell can           
have arbitrary UI               

101
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,130
in it as you will see.          

102
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,234
So how do we use a table view?  

103
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,070
Okay, a table                   
view is a UIView,               

104
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,073
i's actually subclass           
UIScrollView because i's        

105
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,176
scrolling through               
all those rows.                 

106
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,495
Well 99% of the time, we use    
the special ViewController      

107
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,746
So how do we do it?             

108
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,884
called UITableViewController    
in UIKit.                       

109
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,922
And UITableViewController is    
just a convenient package to    

110
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:56,261
use UITableView in and its      
self.view is a UITableView.     

111
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,063
Okay, so you would only use     
a UITableViewController         

112
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,066
when your entire self.view      
is going to be filled           

113
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,035
with a table view.              

114
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,771
And you can add one into your   
storyboard just by dragging it  

115
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,139
out as we always do.            

116
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,841
There's a thing called          
Table View Controller and       

117
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,675
it's just gonna drag it out.    

118
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,878
Now it's a controller,          
so when you drag it out,        

119
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,512
it looks like an MVC.           

120
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,314
But inside of that MVC,         

121
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,316
there is a table view           
sitting there, okay?            

122
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,986
And so what you see             
here the controller,            

123
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,420
is a UITableViewController,     

124
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,191
and the self.view of            
it is a UITableView.            

125
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,793
Okay, subclass                  
of UIScrollView.                

126
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,662
Now like any other              
ViewController,                 

127
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,498
if you're going to do           
anything with this thing,       

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,400
you need to subclass it,        
right?                          

129
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,302
Just like you create a          
calculator view controller or   

130
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,169
graph view controller,          

131
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,540
you need to subclass, your      
UITableViewController as well.  

132
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,074
And you do it the same way,     
right?                          

133
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,910
New files are created.          

134
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,146
It's gonna be                   
a Cocoa Touch Class of course.  

135
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,548
It's gonna be a subclass        
of UITableViewController.       

136
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,549
Make sure you pick that.        

137
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,585
Don't say it's a subclass       
of UIViewController.            

138
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,955
It has to be a subclass         
UITableViewController if you    

139
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,090
want it to work.                

140
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,660
And then you just set it        
in the identity inspector       

141
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,995
Just exactly like any other     
controllers, just that it has   

142
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,262
to be your class.               

143
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,033
to be subclass                  
UITableViewController.          

144
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,002
This UITableViewController      
subclass                        

145
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,739
is also going to serve as       
the data source and delegates.  

146
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,707
Okay, the data source is just   
a special kind of delegate for  

147
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,010
getting the data in the table.  

148
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,045
For the table view              
that's inside of it.            

149
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,114
So, we're gonna talk            
a lot more about that           

150
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,449
down the road here.             

151
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,352
By the way, if you right click  
on the view controller and      

152
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,888
you get that black window to    
come up, you can actually see   

153
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,623
it, if you look down            
towards the bottom there,       

154
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,225
you see data source and         
delegate.                       

155
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,560
Their properties and            
they're pre wired up for you.   

156
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,862
If you use this                 
UITableViewController thing,    

157
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,431
just pre-wires it up.           

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,399
That the controller             
is the delegate and             

159
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,335
data source of the table view.  

160
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,304
If you don't use                
UITableViewController,          

161
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,373
by the way,                     
this kinda pre-packaged one?    

162
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,375
Then you'll have to wire        
up the data source and          

163
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,811
delegate, you know,             
either in code by saying        

164
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,215
tableView.delegate = self or    
something like that.            

165
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,150
You'll have to do it yourself   
but 99% of the time you're      

166
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,685
just gonna use this             
UITableViewController.          

167
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,921
Cuz usually the best UI for     
a table view, is for            

168
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,156
it to take over                 
the whole screen.               

169
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,025
For it to fill the whole        
screen, it's rare that you can  

170
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,560
have a table view in            
part of your screen.            

171
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,866
So you can edit the attributes  
of the table view itself,       

172
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,734
of course,                      
by just clicking on it and      

173
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,670
bringing up                     
the attributes inspector.       

174
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,172
One thing that's a little       
frustrating about a table view  

175
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,309
is you've got the table view    
cells, which are UIViews.       

176
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,844
And then you've got the table   
view kind of that they're       

177
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,479
contained in.                   

178
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,147
That's a UIView also.           

179
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,149
And then you've got the table   
view controller behind it.      

180
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,651
And you wanna set attributes    
on all of these things.         

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,523
So don't forget you can do      
Ctrl+Shift+Left-click, and      

182
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,424
it'll put up a little menu.     

183
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,459
Says, okay, what thing under    
the mouse do you want?          

184
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,796
Do you want the cell, the       
table view, or the controller?  

185
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,800
And so that'll help you dig     
down to the thing you want.     

186
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,368
All right, but                  
once you have it selected,      

187
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,203
whichever one you want,         
like the TableView or           

188
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,506
the Controller or the Cell,     
you can inspect it of course.   

189
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,877
Now, one important thing is     
this grouped versus plain that  

190
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,045
I showed you at                 
the very beginning.             

191
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,648
So here I'm gonna switch        
this one which is plain         

192
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,182
over to grouped.                

193
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,352
So I'm just picking grouped     
in the style there,             

194
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,619
in the inspector.               

195
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,455
Another important attribute     
is dynamic versus static.       

196
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,259
So dynamic is all the contents  
are coming from some database.  

197
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,363
And static is, I'm gonna put    
all the content right here in   

198
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,698
the story board, okay?          

199
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,199
So here we'll switch            
this one over to static.        

200
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,570
So this is now a static,        
grouped table view.             

201
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,205
And I told you that             
usually static table views      

202
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,509
are grouped, and usually only   
grouped ones are static.        

203
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,011
So usually these                
kinda go together.              

204
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,880
They don't have to, they're     
separate properties, but        

205
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,682
they generally go together.     

206
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,051
Now the UI for these rows,      
most of the time you're         

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,921
just going to build             
by dragging UI in.              

208
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,759
So here I'm just dragging the   
label in here, and you know,    

209
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,429
maybe I'll change the name of   
the label, dragging the UI      

210
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:55,199
switch in there, cuz I want     
to set up some settings.        

211
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,569
Often times, by the way, this   
thing is used for settings and  

212
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,737
things like that.               

213
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:03,008
And then if I want to talk      
to these switches and           

214
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,410
labels that I brought in        
there, I'm actually gonna       

215
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,581
create outlets to my            
UITableViewController.          

216
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,383
And since what's in             
this table is fixed for         

217
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,485
all time in the storyboard.     

218
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,954
I'm building it                 
in a storyboard,                

219
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,122
that's perfectly fine.          

220
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,191
So I would just Ctrl + drag     
from them to my controller,     

221
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,061
which will work, and then       
I can create an outlet for      

222
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,730
example, my feature             
enabled switch outlet and       

223
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,798
it'll create an outlet here.    

224
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,134
And then in my code and         
my controller,                  

225
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,969
I can obviously do whatever     
I want to that switch.          

226
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,573
So, it's almost like when you   
have a static table view, it's  

227
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,843
almost just like a normal view  
that you would build UI in.     

228
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,845
It's just that it's             
divided into these rows.        

229
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,914
Which is nice for something     
like settings, right?           

230
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,549
If you think about              
the settings app, right,        

231
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,817
on your phone.                  

232
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,355
It's got a lot of UI that's     
kind of in rows right, and      

233
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,356
in tables.                      

234
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,958
So, if you really wanna see     
how static table view works,    

235
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,493
get your phone out, go to       
the general settings app and    

236
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,662
just look around in there.      

237
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,232
That is table view after table  
view after table view where     

238
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,769
the rows are static built in    
some storyboard somewhere by    

239
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,736
Apple.                          

240
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:11,075
All right, so that's pretty     
much it for static table.       

241
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,776
These are pretty                
straightforward to do.          

242
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,712
So I'm gonna clear              
this UI out of here,            

243
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,649
this featured enabled out of    
there, then we're gonna talk    

244
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,252
about a different kind of       
table view, which is dynamic.   

245
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,555
So a dynamic table view, you    
set it here by picking dynamic  

246
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,992
property, prototypes, rather,   
there instead of static cells,  

247
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,694
really is a totally different   
kind of animal, and             

248
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,798
I'm gonna switch back to plain  
style because usually dynamic   

249
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,700
tables are plain style.         

250
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,003
These rows now instead of       
being something you're          

251
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,338
gonna build the UI and          

252
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,274
they're static,                 
instead they're prototypes.     

253
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,043
They're things that are gonna   
be copied for every row.        

254
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,813
So whatever UI you would        
build in one of these rows.     

255
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,381
And you can build               
customize UI,                   

256
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,116
like we saw with                
the static one.                 

257
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,518
It's gonna be copied for        
every single row.               

258
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,419
So these are prototypes.        

259
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,721
You see what I                  
mean by prototype?              

260
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,923
It's like a template that's     
gonna be copied over and        

261
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,460
over and                        
over to make your table.        

262
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,162
So that's a really              
different kind of               

263
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,197
way of looking at things.       

264
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,232
Because this data that's        
gonna go into these rows is     

265
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,969
coming from some database       
somewhere probably and          

266
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,403
filling out all                 
this information.               

267
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,204
So it's a little more           
complicated to build            

268
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,641
a table like this,              
but not a lot more.             

269
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,977
So you can click on any         
one of the cells and            

270
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,612
you can inspect it, right?      

271
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,947
The prototypes that you want.   

272
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,250
For example you could change    
its type from being custom      

273
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,651
to being subtitle.              

274
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,854
All right, so here's what       
a subtitle cell looks like.     

275
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,956
Remember I showed you in        
the very second slide,          

276
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,391
it's one of                     
the pre-canned types.           

277
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,693
And it just has, you know,      

278
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,463
a text field, like a little     
smaller text field.             

279
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,698
So that's a subtitle.           

280
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,535
You can also set with           
accessory there,                

281
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,536
a little thing that can         
appear on the right.            

282
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,506
It could be a little check      
mark that you turn on and off.  

283
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,873
It could be                     
a disclosure indicator,         

284
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,544
which you want to put there if  
clicking on this row is going   

285
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,845
to segue.                       

286
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,514
Okay, that little disclosure    
indicator is just a little,     

287
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,716
kind of gray arrow thing        
that lets the user know,        

288
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,918
hey if I click on this row,     
it's going to segue.            

289
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:05,423
There's also kind of a special  
one called detail disclosure.   

290
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,857
And the detail disclosure       
looks like this,                

291
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,292
it's a little "i" in a circle.  

292
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,662
And what's really cool about    
that is you can segue by        

293
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,898
clicking on the row, but if     
you click on the little blue    

294
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,066
I, it does a different segue.   

295
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,169
Okay, so you kind of have       
your row doing two different    

296
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,438
segues, depending on whether    
they touch on the little i or   

297
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,573
touch somewhere else.           

298
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,308
You see the little gray         
arrow next to the i?            

299
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,277
That's the disclosure           
indicator.                      

300
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,579
So if I click on this row,      
it's going to segue.            

301
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,914
If I click on the little i,     

302
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,350
it's gonna do some              
different segue.                

303
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,818
Maybe bring up some modal       
panel with some information or  

304
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,287
something like that.            

305
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,423
We'll talk about how            
that works in a second.         

306
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,225
All right, so I'm gonna         
go back to non-details,         

307
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,327
go ahead and                    
get rid of that thing.          

308
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,997
But another style besides       
the four pre-canned             

309
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,433
ones I talked about in          
the beginning of this lecture   

310
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,834
that you can pick is custom.    

311
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,438
So custom means that,           
that's just a UIView,           

312
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,606
that you can build              
any UI you want.                

313
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,842
Again similar to                
that feature-enabled            

314
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,911
with the switch that I showed.  

315
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,779
But again, this UI is going     
to get copied over and          

316
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:05,550
over and over for               

317
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,785
Notice, by the way,             
there are multiple prototypes.  

318
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,421
That means you can have         
different setups of UI          

319
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,123
that you could use for          
different rows, okay?           

320
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,493
And we're gonna name each       
of these prototypes so          

321
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,229
that in our code, we can pick   
which prototype we want for     

322
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:18,996
a certain row.                  

323
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,632
It will copy that prototype.    

324
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:26,237
Now, these custom cells,        
you can resize them.            

325
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,508
You can drag stuff into them,   
build UI you want.              

326
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,376
Here, I've built this           
complicated UI with text        

327
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,511
fields and an image.            

328
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,214
This is very similar to a UI    
that I'm gonna build in         

329
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,483
All right, now when you build   
this UI you're gonna want       

330
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,685
the demo.                       

331
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,519
to use proper layout.           

332
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,589
So stack views and hooking it   
to the edges just like you did  

333
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,259
with the calculator or          
even stuff on the inside.       

334
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,827
I'll show you a little          
bit of that today,              

335
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,228
a little more auto layout.      

336
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,431
Because if you do that, then    
the table view will be able to  

337
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,436
figure out the size this thing  
needs to be dynamically.        

338
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,171
Okay, if you don't do           
the right auto layout then you  

339
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,273
kind of just have to fix        
the height of the rows, and     

340
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,109
I'm going to talk about         
that in a minute as well.       

341
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,144
So generally you want to        
do auto layout properly         

342
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,445
in there if you can.            

343
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,348
Now ther's no way I             
could wire up these             

344
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,184
elements directly               
to my controller.               

345
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,451
Do you see why?                 

346
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,222
Because ther's only one         
outlet in my controller for     

347
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,757
one of these labels.            

348
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,492
But there                       
are hundreds of rows.           

349
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,794
So how is my one outlet gonna?  

350
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,997
It can't be hooked up           
to 100 at once, okay.           

351
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,566
But I still need outlets        
because how am I gonna          

352
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,834
set these things?               

353
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,968
All right, and so               

354
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,538
the way we're gonna deal with   
that is we're gonna wire these  

355
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,474
things up to outlets in         
the UITableViewCell.            

356
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,645
The UIView that contains them.  

357
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,780
So I told you that              
this cell is a UIView,          

358
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:46,050
a UITableViewCell, and it       
contains all of these things,   

359
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,485
these labels and stuff.         

360
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,753
So, we're gonna have            
outlets in that.                

361
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,488
Now this is the first           
time you've ever seen           

362
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,390
outlet in anything but          
a controller and pretty much    

363
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,493
this is the only other time     
you're gonna have outlets.      

364
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,795
You can't have outlets          
in a regular view, but          

365
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,699
you can have outlets in these   
special table view cells.       

366
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,569
All right, so let's see a       
little bit of how that works.   

367
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,238
So, one thing,                  
if you're gonna have outlets,   

368
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,974
you know you're gonna need      
to have subclass, right?        

369
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,476
Just like you have              
a controller, you can't use     

370
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,812
a generic UIViewController,     
can't put any outlets in that;  

371
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,050
you have to subclass it so you  
can wire out, same thing here.  

372
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,419
You're gonna have to            
make a custom subclass,         

373
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,686
a UITableViewCell.              

374
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,288
You do that with New File.      

375
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,058
It is still a Cocoa Touch       
Class, but here you're going    

376
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,459
to choose UITableViewCell       
as the super class,             

377
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,028
not UITableViewController.      

378
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,830
UITableViewCell.                

379
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,400
And again UITableViewCell is    
a subclass of UIView also,      

380
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,619
All right, so you're going      
to pick a UITableViewCell,      

381
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,770
by the way.                     

382
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,605
call it something like          
MyTableViewCell or whatever.    

383
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,841
And then you're gonna do the    
exact same thing where you're   

384
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,409
gonna have that cell selected.  

385
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,478
And you're gonna go to          
the identity inspector.         

386
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,614
And you're gonna change         
it from being a generic         

387
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,882
UITableViewCell to              
being MyTableViewCell.          

388
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,585
And this is gonna allow         
you to create outlets           

389
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,922
In MyTableViewCell to these     
things that are contained       

390
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,990
inside MyTableViewCell.         

391
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,092
Okay, so                        
now we can wire them up.        

392
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,696
So remember that                
static elements,                

393
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,630
those things I showed           
you at the beginning,           

394
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,533
those are wired up              
to the controller.              

395
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,468
Dynamic elements, where         
we have these prototypes,       

396
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,205
those are wired up to           
the TableViewCell outlets.      

397
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,009
So what does it look            
like to wire them up?           

398
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,244
I'm gonna have to do the same   
thing with the controller       

399
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,781
where I'm gonna get the UI and  
the code on screen              

400
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,349
at the same time with           
the assistant editor.           

401
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,153
By the way, when you do that,   
if you're in automatic mode,    

402
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,388
there, see where                
it says automatic?              

403
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,722
It's pointing at automatic.     

404
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,992
It's not going to bring up the  
UITableViewCell, even if you    

405
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,261
have the TableViewCell          
selected in the UI.             

406
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,696
It's still gonna bring          
up the controller, okay?        

407
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,566
So if you want to wire up       
outlets to a TableViewCell,     

408
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,034
you have to manually or         

409
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,670
forcibly get that               
TableViewCell- not              

410
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,840
the TableViewController-        
TableViewCell, on this side.    

411
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,044
So one way you can do it is     
by switching from Automatic     

412
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,146
to Manual and then navigating   
over to finding your            

413
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,649
TableViewCell.swift class,      
right?                          

414
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,017
And then choosing that.         

415
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,052
And now you're in manual mode,  

416
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,620
you've got the TableViewCell    
on the right, and               

417
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,987
you've got your                 
storyboard on the left.         

418
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,656
So, now you can Ctrl+drag,      
right?                          

419
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,991
You just need to be             
able to Ctrl+drag               

420
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,091
between them is the problem.    

421
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,094
So you gotta have               
them both on screen.            

422
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,828
All right, so then,             
once I have them on screen,     

423
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,965
I Ctrl+drag,                    
just absolutely normally.       

424
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,167
And it's gonna do all the       
things that an outlet does,     

425
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,870
it's gonna ask me,              
an outlet or action.            

426
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,337
By the way, you can do          
outlet or action here.          

427
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,371
And it's gonna ask.             

428
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,141
So here, I've picked that       
photo, the blue thing.          

429
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,043
Let's say it's a photo.         

430
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,112
And I'm calling this            
my photoImageView.              

431
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,081
And it creates an outlet here.  

432
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,782
Okay, so that's great.          

433
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,152
Now this TableViewCell code     
can talk to that photo.         

434
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,055
The ImageView could for         
example set the image or        

435
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,122
whatever.                       

436
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,360
But of course it needs to       
know what information to put    

437
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,829
in that photo for               
that row, right?                

438
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,765
This thing is gonna be          
repeated 100 times, and         

439
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,068
each one needs to know          
what its row's photo is.        

440
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,472
So you're also gonna need       
some public API on your         

441
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,376
TableViewCell which gives it    
the data it needs to fill up    

442
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,643
all its outlets.                

443
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,246
Okay, so you're gonna           
have some var, which I've       

444
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:06,183
called infoShownByThisCell,     
could be of any type you want.  

445
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,319
And somebody is gonna set it,   
you'll see soon who sets it.    

446
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,822
And once it sets it,            
now we can update the UI and    

447
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,026
put all this information        
into the outlets.               

448
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,028
Okay, so this is how            
the information at each row in  

449
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,098
the table is going to be        
put into these UI elements.     

450
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,067
You all following me so far?    

451
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:28,305
All right, let's talk           
about these two protocols,      

452
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,142
the dataSource and              
the delegate, okay.             

453
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,277
They're critical to             
making UITableView work.        

454
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,980
UITableView is a class that     
literally cannot function       

455
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,915
without its dataSource and      
delegate.                       

456
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,650
It's not really like split      
view controller where, eh, you  

457
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,454
don't have to do anything with  
a delegate if you don't want,   

458
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,388
it'll still work.               

459
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,022
This, you really                
have to do it.                  

460
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,157
Especially the dataSource.      

461
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,059
If you don't give it            
a dataSource, the only          

462
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,262
way a table view would work     
without its delegate and        

463
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,597
dataSource is if it were        
purely static table.            

464
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,833
Like the table that had         
the feature enabled with        

465
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:56,467
the switch.                     

466
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,435
That you could deal             
without the dataSource.         

467
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,771
But otherwise, if it's          
providing dynamic data,         

468
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,806
obviously it needs the data.    

469
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,574
And the only way                
it can get data is              

470
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,042
through its dataSource.         

471
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,745
So, as I already told you,      
UITableViewController           

472
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,848
automatically sets itself as    
its delegate and dataSource.    

473
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,284
So you can just put your code   
for these delegate methods      

474
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,953
right in your subclass of       
UITableViewController, right.   

475
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:21,858
MyTableViewController, or       
whatever, and put it in there.  

476
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,596
Also, there's a cool var in     
TableViewController called      

477
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,633
tableView, which is basically   
gonna return self.view, but     

478
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,034
as a UITableView.               

479
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,171
And that way you can talk to    
the UITableView that your       

480
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,740
UITableViewController is        
controlling.                    

481
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,343
So when do we need to           
implement the dataSource?       

482
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,812
Anytime we have dynamic data,   
non-static.                     

483
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,748
There are three really          
important methods in this       

484
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,467
One is, how many sections       
are in my table?                

485
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,118
protocol.                       

486
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,654
Could be one section if         
the whole thing is just         

487
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,221
a bunch of rows.                

488
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,521
How many sections, and          

489
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,691
then how many rows              
are in each section?            

490
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,359
You're gonna be                 
asked one by one.               

491
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,326
How many rows in this section?  

492
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,995
How many rows in this section?  
How many are in this section?   

493
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,231
So it knows how many rows       
are in every section.           

494
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,200
And then most importantly,      
give me one of those            

495
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,103
UITableViewCells to             
draw this row.                  

496
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,339
Okay, so for each row that      
the TableView wants to draw,    

497
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,675
i's going to ask you, okay,     
give me a UITableViewCell now,  

498
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,011
cuz I'm going to                
draw this row.                  

499
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,978
Okay, so that's how it works,   

500
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,714
that's fundamentally            
how this works.                 

501
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,717
Now, all these methods are in   
the UITableViewDataSource       

502
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,884
protocol.                       

503
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,420
So let's look at the last one,  
the give me a UITableViewCell,  

504
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,755
cuz it's the most complicated.  

505
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,158
The other ones are super,       
super simple.                   

506
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,894
So the way that you are going   
to give a UITableViewCell       

507
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,965
back to the TableView when      
it's time to draw a certain     

508
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,367
row is by a method              
being called.                   

509
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,770
Now, you might be worried       
here, it's like woah,           

510
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,173
I'm gonna have this big UI      
with all these labels and       

511
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,477
image views in it, and I have,  
what if I have 100,000 rows?    

512
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,846
I'm going to make               
100,000 views.                  

513
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,115
Surely that's going to          
be terrible performance.        

514
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,451
And in fact, that would be      
terrible performance, okay.     

515
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,353
Views are not cheap.            

516
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,957
But no worries, because         
all your UITableViewCells,      

517
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,861
these UIViews that draw         
the rows, they're reused.       

518
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,897
So only the visible ones        
have UITableViewCells.          

519
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,900
As you scroll around, the ones  
that scroll off the top         

520
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,770
get picked up and put around    
and used on the bottom, okay?   

521
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,340
And the new data keeps          
getting pumped into them.       

522
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,474
Do you see what I'm saying?     

523
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,876
So those cells, only the,       

524
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,845
maybe the ones on               
the screen plus two or          

525
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,547
three on either side            
are actually getting created.   

526
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,815
They're just getting reused.    

527
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,884
As you scroll up and down,      
they keep getting reused.       

528
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,287
Now, the thing                  
about that reuse,               

529
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,422
I want you to be                
very careful of.                

530
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,255
I put it in red.                

531
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,191
When I put it in red, you       
know that means wake up and     

532
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,427
watch out, cuz your homework.   

533
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,795
When you're doing               
multithreaded things,           

534
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,530
you've got to be careful,       

535
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,366
because by the time you come    
back from something you asked   

536
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:47,471
to do on another thread, your   
cell might be reused, okay.     

537
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,773
And so you've got to            
be prepared for that.           

538
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,609
You gotta understand whether    
you're still the cell you       

539
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,346
thought you were when you       
sent something off to go in     

540
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,646
another thread.                 

541
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,715
Okay, so I'm warning you.       

542
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,518
So what does this method look   
like that the UITableView is    

543
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,954
gonna send to its               
data source to say,             

544
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,355
give me a UITableViewCell?      

545
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,425
It's called                     
cellForRowAt indexPath.         

546
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,827
You see it right there.         

547
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,094
That's its signature.           

548
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,165
It really only has that         
one argument, indexPath.        

549
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,700
The indexPath is just           
a little container of           

550
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,469
the section and row.            

551
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,704
You could imagine this is       
even called cellForRowAt        

552
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,505
section and row.                

553
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,974
But it just puts them           
in one argument called          

554
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,275
an indexPath, okay.             

555
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,577
And then all you return         
is a UITableViewCell.           

556
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,047
And it's gonna use that         
UITableViewCell to draw         

557
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,048
that row.                       

558
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,651
So it really couldn't           
be a simpler API.               

559
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,687
It's at the heart of exactly    
what it's asking you to do.     

560
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,555
Now, what are you gonna         
do inside this method?          

561
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,859
Well, first you're going to     
have to get the data from your  

562
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,628
model that you want             
to show in that row.            

563
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,463
Okay.                           

564
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,998
And you can do this             
any way you want.               

565
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,234
I have a very convenient        
data structure here called      

566
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,569
myInternalDataStructure that    
happens to be divided           

567
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,038
in sections and rows.           

568
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,639
So I can just index into it.    

569
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,508
But you might have              
a different data structure.     

570
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,543
But you've gotta take           
the section and row so          

571
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,912
that you know which row         
you're talking about, and       

572
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,347
get the data out                
of your model.                  

573
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,949
Maybe you're doing              
a database query.               

574
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,685
Maybe you're even doing         
a network query in another      

575
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,921
thread and it's gonna return    
and fill this out, whatever.    

576
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,889
You need to figure out          
how to get your data.           

577
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,959
Now, once you have your data,   
you're gonna create a cell.     

578
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,328
I'm gonna show you how          
to do that in a second.         

579
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,029
And then you're just            
gonna load up that cell         

580
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:19,764
with the data.                  

581
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,733
So let's talk about how         
we create that cell and         

582
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,902
So I'm gonna take this          
little piece of code, and       

583
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,003
load it up.                     

584
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,605
I'm gonna keep it on screen     
while I go back to showing you  

585
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,408
what's happening                
in the UI here.                 

586
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:37,147
So first let's talk about a     
cell that's not a custom cell.  

587
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,648
It's just a regular             
cell like subtitle.             

588
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,450
You see subtitle up there?      

589
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,687
Okay, so we're gonna use        
this method here called         

590
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,925
dequeueReusableCell(withIdent-  
ifier: for: indexPath).         

591
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,461
And that's just gonna return    
us a UITableViewCell.           

592
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,630
Now, again, this is             
a reused UITableViewCell.       

593
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,468
Okay, being reused,             

594
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,438
now if this cell, if there's    
not enough been created yet,    

595
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,573
then it will create one         
based on your prototype.        

596
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,776
Whatever your prototype         
you pick in there.              

597
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,979
And you pick which              
prototype with this string,     

598
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,281
the identifier string           

599
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,650
which you set in                
the inspector for the cell.     

600
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,652
So, it's just in there,         
it's called identifier,         

601
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,489
the utilities inspector on the  
right is inspecting that cell,  

602
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,424
that top cell that says title,  
subtitle,                       

603
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,258
it's inspecting that.           

604
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,761
And I'm just setting            
the identifier of my cell, so   

605
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,596
now in my code when I say,      
dequeueReuseableCellwithIdent-  

606
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,634
ifier of MyCell, it's gonna     
make a copy of that prototype.  

607
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,303
Unless there's                  
some to be reused,              

608
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,638
then it'll just reuse them.     

609
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,339
But until it gets               
enough to reuse,                

610
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,273
it uses that prototype and      

611
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,043
just makes copies               
of it as necessary.             

612
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,680
Now, this is                    
a non-custom cell, so           

613
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,149
the only, well there's          
a few fields you can set.       

614
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,787
You can go look at the API for  
UITableViewCell to find out.    

615
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,325
But the cell, set those two     
pieces of text, title and       

616
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,258
subtitle there.                 

617
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,362
You just,                       
you use textlabel.text and      

618
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,530
detailtextlabel.text.           

619
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,399
Those are optional,             
so they could be nil,           

620
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,134
because if there's              
a custom cell, for              

621
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,469
example, it might be nil.       

622
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,472
So anyway that's it,            
you just set those,             

623
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,673
those are just UILabels.        

624
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,842
And so you just set the text,   
it couldn't be easier.          

625
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,710
And that's true for             

626
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,279
all the pre-canned ones,        
you're gonna set these.         

627
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,849
There is actually, I can show   
it, but there's an image also,  

628
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:22,419
that you can set,               
a little image in the cell.     

629
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,920
And that's also in              
the pre-canned ones,            

630
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,889
so you could do that as well,   
okay?                           

631
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,125
So that's it,                   
that's just simple,             

632
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,761
that's all you need to          
do to provide your data         

633
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,764
to the TableViewCell is just    
dequeue one of these cells.     

634
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,599
Just load it up and             
return it, and                  

635
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,868
now the tableView will          
use that to draw.               

636
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,838
But let's talk about            
a custom cell, so               

637
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,974
now I'm talking about           
the second row down.            

638
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,342
And look at its type,           

639
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,278
it's custom- it's not           
subtitle- it's custom.          

640
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,647
Little different for            
a custom cell.                  

641
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,383
You're still gonna do           
dequeueReusableCellwithIdenti-  

642
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,751
fier for index path, okay?      

643
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,688
But of course you're going to   
use a different identifier,     

644
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,524
cuz now I'm talking about       
the second cell down which I'm  

645
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,758
calling my custom cell.         

646
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:06,029
Now here there's no title and   
subtitle in that second row.    

647
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,298
Presumably there's              
that image and                  

648
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,868
the thing under text under      
it and text on the side.        

649
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,735
All the things,                 
whatever your UI switch,        

650
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,138
whatever you built              
in this custom cell.            

651
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,274
And all that stuff has          
got outlets hooked up to        

652
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,879
the UITableViewCell containing  
it, remember all that we did?   

653
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,549
So you need to just pass the    
data to that UITableViewCell    

654
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,752
and it's responsible for        
loading up all the UI.          

655
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,153
Now how do you do that?         

656
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,955
First thing you need to         
do is take that dequeued        

657
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:36,126
thing that came back, which     
is of type UITableViewCell.     

658
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,895
And cast it with "as" to be of  

659
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,765
the type of your subclass       
of UITableViewCell.             

660
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,000
Otherwise you won't be able     
to call any of this API.        

661
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,871
Okay, so you're just gonna do,  
if I can let this cell equal    

662
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,574
the dequeued thing              
as MyTableViewCell.             

663
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,444
Then I'm going to talk to       
MyTableViewCell using its API   

664
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,148
and set, for example,           
infoShownByThisCell to be       

665
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,084
the data that's app             
that section in row.            

666
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:04,087
Okay, so to go back to          
the code I was showing before,  

667
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,191
that info shown by the cell     
is that var right there.        

668
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,628
The var that I made public      
in MyTableViewCell.             

669
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,331
And then it's gonna update UI   
and set all of its outlets and  

670
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,931
all of that.                    

671
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,933
Okay, so that's it,             
that how it works.              

672
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,236
Those are the two cases,        
the kind of pre-canned one and  

673
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,271
the custom one.                 

674
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,540
They're almost identical,       
you're still dequeuing cells,   

675
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,676
you just set the data           
a little bit differently.       

676
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:32,149
Okay, the data source also has  
to know how many sections and   

677
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:32,815
rows.                           

678
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,650
It's really simple,             

679
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,919
there's a method called         
numberOfSections in tableView.  

680
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,287
And that's going                
to return int,                  

681
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,788
how many sections there are.    

682
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,989
By the way that                 
one is optional;                

683
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,558
you don't have to               
implement that one.             

684
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,927
If you don't, it will           
assume there's one section,     

685
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,629
that all the rows are in        
this one big section.           

686
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,466
The other one though, which is  
numberOfRowsInSection where it  

687
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,900
passes you a section number,    
and                             

688
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,003
you have to say how many        
rows are in the section.        

689
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,171
That is not optional,           

690
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,140
that is mandatory, and you      
must answer this question for   

691
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,976
every single section that you   
claim that your table has       

692
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,513
with numberOfSections           
in table, okay?                 

693
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,450
So that's it, that's simple,    
why does it need to know how    

694
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,751
many rows and all of            
the sections, by the way?       

695
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,155
Cuz it's a scroll view and it   
needs to know how big a thing,  

696
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,457
it needs to set it's content    
size basically, right?          

697
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,992
It needs to know how big a      
thing it's scrolling over, so   

698
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:16,826
it needs to know.               

699
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,296
But it also needs to know when  
to ask you for the data and     

700
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,066
all that, so it's pretty        
obvious it needs to know that.  

701
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,534
In a static table by the way,   

702
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,102
it's not gonna ask              
you these questions.            

703
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,437
So don't even                   
worry about that.               

704
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,906
The static table is fixed       
in the StoryBoard, so           

705
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,142
it's never asking you for       
the data.                       

706
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,312
So it's never gonna ask you     
how many rows and sections and  

707
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,113
all that stuff there is.        

708
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,849
So the summary is you set       
the tableView's data source.    

709
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,219
That's automatic if you're      
using UITableViewController.    

710
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,888
You implement numberOfSections  
and numberOfRowsInSection.      

711
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,090
And then you implement          
cellForRowAt.                   

712
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,324
And give back                   
a tableView cell,               

713
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,527
either a custom subclass        
if you're doing custom,         

714
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,431
or just setting                 
the detailed text label and     

715
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,501
then the normal text label      
if you're not, question?        

716
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,303
Okay, so the question is,       
what do I answer for            

717
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,972
that number of sections         
thing if, over time,            

718
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,707
my tableView is growing,        
right?                          

719
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,541
Maybe data is coming in         
from the network, or            

720
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,378
the user is clicking on things  
that makes more table happen.   

721
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,948
You can answer it that          
differently in any time, but    

722
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,619
what you're basically saying    
is, what if my model changes?   

723
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,455
I need my UI, right,            
to keep up with it.             

724
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:21,090
If my model gets bigger,        
then I need more rows.          

725
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,960
Well, you're gonna see that     
it's really important to,       

726
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,529
every time your model changes,  

727
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,697
you need to tell                
the tableView about it.         

728
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,931
And you're gonna                
tell it things like             

729
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,667
I've added a new section.       

730
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,501
And then it will come back and  

731
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,404
ask you all these               
questions again, all right.     

732
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,839
So, that's how it works.        

733
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,907
It might come back and ask      
you these questions including   

734
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,043
cellForRowAt over and           
over and over.                  

735
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,178
As you tell it that you've      
changed your model.             

736
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,047
But of course, your model       
can change over time.           

737
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,184
By the way,                     
the titles of the sections,     

738
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,153
remember when I showed you the  
countries and it had Japan and  

739
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,220
Mexico as titles.               

740
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,056
Those are considered            
part of the data.               

741
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,026
So, those are part of           
the UITableViewDataSource       

742
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,193
protocol as well.               

743
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,164
This method title for header    
or footer in section, and       

744
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,933
you pass the section number     
and it gives you the thing.     

745
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,002
You can also do it with         
a view, using the delegate.     

746
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,537
But if you want to              
just do it as a string,         

747
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,840
you'd use the data source.      

748
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,641
There's a lot of other          
methods in the protocol.        

749
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,776
I'm not gonna really            
talk about them,                

750
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,278
they have to do with things     
like deleting rows or           

751
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,348
rearranging the rows,           
things like that.               

752
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,450
If your model allows            
those things to happen,         

753
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,484
like things being deleted.      

754
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,786
Then you're gonna have          
to teach yourself this.         

755
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,089
Most of you will probably       
end up doing this for           

756
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,157
your final project.             

757
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,692
I'm not gonna ask you to        
do it in the homework, but      

758
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,093
you'll probably do it for       
your final project.             

759
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,360
It's extra credit               
in the homework,                

760
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,130
if you wanna get                
a head start on that.           

761
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,733
All right let's talk            
about seguing from a row.       

762
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,234
So I've got a row there, okay,  

763
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,270
this one actually has a detail  
disclosure in there as well.    

764
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,474
And I wanna segue out of that   
thing, how do I do that?        

765
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,409
Very simple,                    

766
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,179
I do it just like any other     
segueing from the button.       

767
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:53,483
I'm just gonna Ctrl+drag from   
the row to the MVC I want to    

768
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,318
segue to.                       

769
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,386
And it's going to put           
up this black window.           

770
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,187
Now, this black window          

771
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,622
is a little different           
than other segues.              

772
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,459
Because you see it has two      
sections, Selection Segue and   

773
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,761
Accessory Action, okay?         

774
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,697
So the Selection Segue is if    
they click on the row and       

775
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,099
the Accessory Action            
is if they click on             

776
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,234
the little accessory button.    

777
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,639
But it's just a normal segue,   
once you create the segue,      

778
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,109
you can click on it and         
inspect it.                     

779
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,778
Just like any other segue,      

780
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,848
you can set its identifier      
up there to something.          

781
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,683
And then you're gonna           
have prepare for segue.         

782
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:30,053
So, here I've set               
the identifier to be AbcSegue.  

783
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,088
So lets take a look             
at what prepare for             

784
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,092
segue looks like when you're    
doing this kinda segue.         

785
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,893
It looks almost                 
exactly the same,               

786
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,761
here I've got a prepare for     
segue.                          

787
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,964
I've noticed that               
the sender there is Any.        

788
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,200
And when you're segueing        
into tableView,                 

789
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,836
what do you think               
that Any is gonna be?           

790
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,272
UITableViewCell, okay, that     
view that contains the row.     

791
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,008
So that is going                
to be the sender.               

792
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,710
Just like a button              
is the sender                   

793
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,812
if you click on a button        
to segue, the row,              

794
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,382
the UITableViewCell,            
is the sender in that case.     

795
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,785
So the first thing              
you're gonna wanna              

796
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,554
do is convert the sender        
to a TableViewCell.             

797
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:08,191
And specifically to your        
subclass or table view cell.    

798
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,327
If you have a custom            
cell in case you wanna          

799
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,830
do anything that's specific     
to your TableView cell.         

800
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,534
If not then you can just        
do it to UITableViewCell.       

801
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,570
And then you wanna get          
the index path of that cell so  

802
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,272
that you know what row          
where you're segueing from.     

803
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,975
Because every row, you can      
click on it, it will segue.     

804
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,410
So, you need to                 
know which row.                 

805
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:31,547
And you do that by              

806
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,083
And you can't pass any to       
that, you have to pass          

807
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,754
UITableViewCell or subclass     
thereof, indexPath(for: cell).  

808
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,289
Now, I'm gonna give you         
one of those index path         

809
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,492
things remember?                

810
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,660
and row.                        

811
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,398
Then, you're gonna get          
your seguedToMVC as usual.      

812
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,069
And you're going to prepare     
your Segue to public API, and   

813
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,739
you're going to do it using     
the data in your model based    

814
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,776
on the section and              
row that was clicked on.        

815
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,812
Got it?                         

816
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,614
So pretty easy segue from it.   

817
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,750
So yes you're gonna use         
your public API of your         

818
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,585
segue to MVC.                   

819
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,321
What about the table            
view's delegate?                

820
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,222
We talked about the data        

821
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,890
source; what about              
the table view's delegate?      

822
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,592
It's got a kind of              
a miscellaneous                 

823
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,194
bunch of stuff in there but     
generally the delegate          

824
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:21,030
is talking about how the table  
view is displayed, and          

825
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,967
the data source is what data    
is actually in the table.       

826
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:25,769
Okay so that's the difference.  

827
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,039
So the delegate we're           
talking about things,           

828
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,574
yeah they're usually            
the same object.                

829
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:36,246
So the delegate also has all    
the will, did, should things.   

830
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,448
That you could watch what's     
happening in the table view.    

831
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,750
This row did get selected,      
things like that.               

832
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:44,988
For example, here's table       
view target action, so          

833
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,356
if when you click on a row,     
if you don't want a segue, but  

834
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,859
you just want to be target      
action like a button,           

835
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,960
well you can't really do that.  

836
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,163
You can't do target action      
because a row is not            

837
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,030
a UIButton.                     

838
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,766
But you can implement this      
delegate method tableView       

839
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,801
didSelectRowAt indexPath.       

840
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,736
And when someone                
touches on that row,            

841
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,104
this is gonna get called.       

842
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,506
So, it's just like              
target action right.            

843
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,542
It told you what happened.      

844
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,211
So, now you can look at the     
index path row in section to    

845
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,681
know which row was selected so  
we call that target action.     

846
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,550
You did the same thing          
with that detail                

847
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,551
disclosure by the way.          

848
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,119
So I'm gonna click on the       
detail disclosure we're gonna   

849
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,889
get this method in              
your delegate called            

850
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:22,058
accessoryButtonTappedForRow-    
With indexPath.                 

851
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,560
Okay, so now you know           
which row is that.              

852
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,162
So when things are clicked on,  
you can use segue or            

853
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,898
you can use these to find out   
things were clicked on and      

854
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:29,699
do whatever you want.           

855
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,135
So yeah, a lot of wills and     
dids and all those things.      

856
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,137
You can look at                 
the documentation for           

857
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,340
UITableViewDelegate.            

858
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,142
Now back to what this           
guy was asking before.          

859
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,710
What happens if                 
my model changes?               

860
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,444
It gets bigger?                 

861
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,279
Or even gets smaller or         
whatever?                       

862
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,949
One thing you can do            
that's kind of a hammer is      

863
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,850
reloadData.                     

864
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,286
If you go reloadData on your    
table view it's going to call   

865
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,988
all of your data                
source methods again.           

866
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,257
How many sections you got,      
how many rows in each section?  

867
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,158
Give me a cell for              
every single visible row.       

868
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:56,759
You see what I mean?            

869
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,695
It's going to do the whole      
thing all over again.           

870
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,230
It's kind of a hammer because   
if you know that you only       

871
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,599
changed one section okay?       

872
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,169
Then you can call something     
like reloadRows (at             

873
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,403
indexPaths...).                 

874
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,939
And indexPaths would tell       
the sections and rows.          

875
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,474
With some animation.            

876
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,677
And animations can              
be like fade in or              

877
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,614
slide from the bottom or        
things like that.               

878
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,349
So there are lighter            
weight ones you can call.       

879
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,716
And I'm actually gonna          
show you in the demo,           

880
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,720
we're gonna call one where      
we're just gonna tell           

881
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,122
the table view that we          
inserted a section and          

882
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,657
it's going to                   
immediately just ask me         

883
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,294
the data source message about   
that section and nothing else.  

884
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,531
So you do need to               
tell the table view             

885
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,667
every time you                  
change your model.              

886
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:38,601
If you change your model in     

887
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,404
any way that would change the   
number of sections and rows.    

888
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,672
Or even the display of a row,   

889
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,708
you need to tell                
the table view.                 

890
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,242
So, just always think           
about that when you're          

891
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,210
writing table view code.        

892
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,679
Change my model,                
tell the table view.            

893
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,379
Right away.                     

894
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,215
You want to tell the table      
view right away.                

895
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,684
And change your model first,    
then change your table view.    

896
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:55,852
Because when you                
tell your table view            

897
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,588
things have changed, it's       
gonna go back and ask you, so   

898
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,357
for IndexPath,                  
number of sections,             

899
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,725
it'll ask you those questions,  
some of them again.             

900
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,593
So make sure your models        
are already changed and         

901
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,996
ready to answer                 
those questions.                

902
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,932
Le's talk about                 
the height of rows.             

903
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,334
The height of the row           

904
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,702
generally set in                
the Storyboard.                 

905
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,373
So you could resize it and set  
it and tha's what it is but     

906
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,110
you can also ask the delegate.  

907
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,845
You can also implement          
a method in the delegate and    

908
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,915
it'll ask the delegate, what    
height should this row be?      

909
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,784
This might be very useful in    
your homework, by the way.      

910
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,688
But this is for when you have   

911
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,991
the rows that change height     
in some calculated way.         

912
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,393
Maybe you have                  
an image in there, and          

913
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,097
it's got different aspect       
ratios, for example.            

914
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,266
And so it's different           
heights sometimes, whatever.    

915
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,901
So you can answer it this way.  

916
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,304
Of course, the other way        
you can control the height      

917
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,440
is by doing auto layout, and    

918
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:53,443
setting your height to          
be automatic dimension.         

919
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,780
If you set your height to be    
UITableViewAutomaticDimension,  

920
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:00,450
that means go figure it out     
from the auto layout please.    

921
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,051
So those are the three was      
you can set the height.         

922
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,554
Set it fixed in the story       
board, answer this delegate     

923
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,657
method here,                    
heightForRowAt indexPath,       

924
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,092
or set it to                    
the automatic dimension.        

925
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,863
If you do the automatic ways    
then you also probably want to  

926
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,232
set the estimated row height.   

927
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,302
That just tells the table view  
calculate from auto layout but  

928
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,238
for all those cells             
the 100,000 cells that aren't   

929
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,075
on screen please don't do auto  
layout for 100,000 cells.       

930
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,711
Just estimate them to be about  
this and as they start to come  

931
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,846
on screen then it's gonna       
do the auto layout and          

932
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,749
pick the exact                  
right height okay.              

933
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,118
So that's why you               
need to estimate.               

934
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,419
And there's also                
a delicate method,              

935
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:39,856
estimated height per            
row at whatever.                

936
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,892
So there's dozens of methods    
also, in table view itself.     

937
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,795
Not in its delegates, but       
in table view itself.           

938
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,597
You can scroll to a row         
cuz it's a scroll view.         

939
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,632
It knows how to do scrolling.   

940
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,002
You can control the look,       
the separators between rows.    

941
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,003
All those kind of things.       

942
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,406
So you're definitely want       
to familiarize yourself         

943
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,708
with the table                  
view API itself.                

944
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,508
Don't forget about that.        

945
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,478
All right, so I'm not           
coming back to this slide.      

946
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,881
So just give you                
a quick coming up here.         

947
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,382
We have collection              
view on Friday.                 

948
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,551
So collection view is very      
similar to table view,          

949
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,454
but the layout doesn't have     
to be in a strict table.        

950
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,689
It can be kind of laid          
out any way you want.           

951
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,691
But it's the same kind of       
thing where there's data and    

952
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,561
it's gonna ask you how many     
sections there, how many row,   

953
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,430
not rows but items in that      
section, then it's gonna have   

954
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,633
this little extra mechanism     
for doing a lay out.            

955
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:24,601
So it's really awesome.         

956
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,836
I'd love to have time to        
teach it in lecture not in      

957
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,438
the optional section but I've   
got so much to teach in this    

958
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,142
course and you really need to   
understand TableView first,     

959
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,210
which is a little simpler,      
before you can move onto        

960
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,379
CollectionView- but             
really don't miss Friday.       

961
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:40,282
It will be a good way to        
really it much more powerful    

962
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,719
kind of data presentation UI.   

963
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,221
And then next week we gonna     
talk about Core Data,           

964
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,756
which is the object-oriented    
database in iOS,                

965
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,959
really powerful mechanism.      

966
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,995
Right now, I'm gonna be         
doing a big demo that shows     

967
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,730
how to do all this              
TableView stuff and             

968
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,999
also TextField and              
some other things.              

969
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,634
And your Assignment 4 is out,   

970
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,537
and it's due in one week,       
on Wednesday and it's           

971
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:05,241
basically to take what I do     
today and build a better one.   

972
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,343
More feature-full.              

973
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,210
So that's why you               

974
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,780
always want to understand what  
I'm doing in lecture, because   

975
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,115
I'm almost always just asking   
you to do the same thing.       

976
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,984
Okay so                         
I'm gonna build a completely    

977
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,286
fresh app from scratch.         

978
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,554
Like I said before it's         
gonna be a Twitter client.      

979
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,790
We're gonna be doing            
Twitter searches.               

980
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,927
It's gonna be                   
a single view app.              

981
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,079
i'm gonna call it Smashtag,     
kind of like hashtag.           

982
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,164
As always,                      

983
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,099
This is gonna be                
an iPhone-only app.             

984
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,034
And that's true for             
your homework as well.          

985
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,570
Okay, iPhone-only, we're        
not gonna do an iPad thing.     

986
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,439
You already learned that        
with assignment three.          

987
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:39,208
Trying to keep what             
you're learning                 

988
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,243
as new as possible              
with each one.                  

989
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,113
I'm gonna put this where        
I always put everything.        

990
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,350
Here we go, I'm gonna get rid   
of some of these things over    

991
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:50,120
here that we don't              
really use very much.           

992
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,955
Actually I'm gonna leave        
plist as you'll see.            

993
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:57,427
New group, we'll do             
Supporting Files here, and      

994
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,428
I will move that down.          

995
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,498
Now I'm gonna start by taking   
my Storyboard here and          

996
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,167
just totally wiping it out.     

997
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,402
Okay, I'm just gonna take       
the one controller that I got,  

998
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,670
the free one, and               
just delete it.                 

999
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,939
I'm even gonna go over to       
this code right here and        

1000
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,408
delete that, same thing         
I did in the last demo.         

1001
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,344
Cuz I don't need any of that,   

1002
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,212
I'm gonna start                 
from scratch here.              

1003
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,748
So, we're building              
a table view app, so            

1004
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,551
let's grab a table view,        
I'm gonna scroll down here.     

1005
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,287
Here's a table view right       
here, I just drag it out.       

1006
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:28,558
Now this table view if we       
wanna use it as a delegate and  

1007
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:31,260
data source, or if we wanna     
have outlets to it, we,         

1008
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,795
of course,                      
need a subclass of it.          

1009
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:37,533
So let's go ahead and           
do that, New > File, okay.      

1010
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,102
It's gonna be                   
a Cocoa Touch subclass,         

1011
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,471
namely a                        
UITableViewController.          

1012
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,374
And I'm gonna call this my      
TweetTableViewController,       

1013
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,510
because it's gonna              
show tweets.                    

1014
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,812
All right, and I'm gonna be     
very careful to put it here,    

1015
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,215
not at the top level            
of my project there.            

1016
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,185
And here we go,                 
here's our code right here.     

1017
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:59,656
I'm gonna delete this           
View Controller Lifecycle       

1018
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:00,656
stuff, as usual.                

1019
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,124
But you'll notice               
the TableViewController         

1020
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,826
also has some extra stuff.      

1021
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,629
You recognize those methods,    
numberOfSections, okay,         

1022
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,133
numberOfRowsInSection, and      
cellForRowAt indexPath.         

1023
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:15,604
These are the key               
UITableViewDataSource           

1024
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,674
methods here.                   

1025
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,476
Now there's some other          
UITableViewDataSource           

1026
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,678
methods here as well,           
these are for                   

1027
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,181
things like deleting rows,      
moving rows.                    

1028
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,149
So when you're doing            
your extra credit, or           

1029
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,817
when you're doing               
your final project,             

1030
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,486
you'll be wanting to            
not delete those.               

1031
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:34,390
But I will delete those just    
to make our code a little bit   

1032
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,359
cleaner here.                   

1033
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:37,893
So that's our                   
UITableViewController           

1034
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,129
subclass, we'll have to         
implement these in a second.    

1035
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,898
But let's go back               
to our Storyboard.              

1036
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:47,103
We also obviously wanna set     
our identity here to instead    

1037
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,641
of being just generic           
UITableViewController,          

1038
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:55,978
we want it to be                
a TweetTableViewController.     

1039
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,780
Also, where's our               
arrow coming in?                

1040
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,482
There's no arrow, so            
let's select it again and       

1041
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,953
go back to attributes and pick  
is initial view controller, so  

1042
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,621
we get this arrow coming in.    

1043
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,656
Okay, otherwise,                
when we launch our app,         

1044
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,926
it's not gonna know what MVC    
to start with, all right?       

1045
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,830
Now whenever we                 
have a new MVC,                 

1046
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,632
what's one of the first         
things we always wanna do?      

1047
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,200
Define its model.               

1048
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,103
Understand what this            
MVC is all about.               

1049
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,639
What does it show or do?        

1050
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:29,645
And I'm going to pick my model  
to be an array of tweets.       

1051
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,313
Okay, I'm gonna                 
call it tweets.                 

1052
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,883
But I'm actually gonna          
make it be an array             

1053
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,253
of array of tweets.             

1054
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,890
Okay, why am I making an array  
of an array of tweets?          

1055
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:44,160
Because I'm going to be able    
to put some tweets in my table  

1056
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,629
and then go fetch some          
more and put more in.           

1057
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,432
And every time I put more in,   
I'm gonna put it as a new       

1058
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,101
section, okay,                  
table view section.             

1059
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,904
So each array on                
the inside of this array        

1060
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,438
is another batch of tweets.     

1061
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,808
And the outer array is          
all of my sections.             

1062
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,376
So I have a really nice         
data structure here.            

1063
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,578
It really matches up            
nicely with table view.         

1064
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,748
And it's kind of nice to have   
that kind of data structure.    

1065
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,817
And I kind of recommend that    
in the homework if you can      

1066
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,219
make your data structure        
match up with sections and      

1067
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,055
rows, then it makes             
the implementation              

1068
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,757
of all these methods            
down here a lot simpler.        

1069
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:19,294
All right, so, I've got         
another part of my model,       

1070
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,064
though, which is                
some searchText.                

1071
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,400
So the searchText               
is like #stanford,              

1072
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,936
that's what I                   
wanna search for.               

1073
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,271
So this searchText is           
what I'm searching for          

1074
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,740
to find my tweets.              

1075
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,141
And I'm making                  
this one public,                

1076
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,410
this is gonna be a public       
part of my model.               

1077
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:37,779
So anyone using my MVC,         
they set the search text.       

1078
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,082
I will show those tweets.       

1079
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:40,917
That's what I do.               

1080
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,188
All right, and I'm gonna do     
that by populating this part    

1081
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,623
of my model over                
here to show them.              

1082
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,393
So what do I need to do         
if the searchText is set?       

1083
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,163
So I need to do some didSet     
here, so the public model,      

1084
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,699
if something sets it,           
I have to react well to it.     

1085
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,469
I mean, one thing that I'm      
gonna wanna do is remove        

1086
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,138
all the tweets that             
are already in my table.        

1087
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:05,340
And when I remove those         
from my model up here,          

1088
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,743
I need to tell the table        
view about it.                  

1089
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,479
So I'm gonna have the           
tableView.reloadData(), which   

1090
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,382
is the hammer, which is okay,   
because I removed everything,   

1091
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,250
so the hammer's gonna           
be pretty light,                

1092
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,619
a little ball-peen hammer.      

1093
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,754
Okay, just going to             
clear the table out, so         

1094
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,723
tha's perfectly                 
fine in this case.              

1095
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:22,591
What else do I need to do?      

1096
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,093
Well, I, now I need             
to search for tweets.           

1097
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,963
So I have to write a function   
to do that to search for        

1098
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:28,998
some tweet.                     

1099
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:32,501
I'm also gonna set my title     
equal to the searchText.        

1100
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,703
That way if I happen to be in   
a navigation controller or      

1101
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,272
something like that, it'll      
show whatever I'm searching     

1102
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,208
for, #stanford or               
whatever at the top, so         

1103
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,613
I'll just make my               
UI look nice there.             

1104
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:45,547
All right, so                   

1105
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,384
we got to do this private       
func searchForTweets.           

1106
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,055
Okay, so this is the thing      
that needs to go off and        

1107
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:58,060
find these tweets, and so       
we'll do that in a moment.      

1108
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,395
One thing I'm also gonna do     
is I'm gonna do viewDidLoad,    

1109
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,531
just for testing purposes.      

1110
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,466
You notice I do this a lot      
when I'm developing, and        

1111
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,868
I wanna have some testing,      

1112
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,137
I'm gonna just set my           
model to something.             

1113
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,740
So we'll do #stanford,          
okay, just for testing.         

1114
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,509
Once we're got                  
our MVC working,                

1115
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:17,012
its public API is working,      
then we will remove this code.  

1116
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:17,914
It's just testing code.         

1117
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,916
Okay, now,                      
we have an error here.          

1118
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,586
And this error is Swift         
saying excuse me.               

1119
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,755
What is tweet?                  

1120
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:28,991
What is that type?              

1121
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,094
And I didn't really want you    
to be wasting your time in      

1122
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:35,231
your homework figuring          
out how to go fetch             

1123
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,167
a tweet from Twitter and        
do a request and all that.      

1124
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,703
So I wrote a framework          
that did it for you.            

1125
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,440
And by framework,               
I mean a framework like this.   

1126
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,076
Like UIKit, right, UIKit is     
this like library of a whole    

1127
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,746
bunch of data structures that   
you can use to build your app.  

1128
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:54,083
Well, I wrote one for you that  
will do Twitter stuff for it.   

1129
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:55,718
And it has something            
in it called tweet.             

1130
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,620
And it also has something       
called request that lets        

1131
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,655
you make a Twitter request.     

1132
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,925
All right, so                   
that thing is right over here.  

1133
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,195
Now, how do frameworks work?    

1134
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,731
How do you use them when        
they're not built into          

1135
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,265
the system like Apple?          

1136
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,903
And the answer is, you need to  
build a higher level structure  

1137
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,006
for Xcode to work with          
called a workspace.             

1138
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,343
So I'm actually gonna           
close this project.             

1139
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:22,745
I'm closing this project.       

1140
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:25,648
And I'm going to Xcode, and     
I'm gonna create a new thing,   

1141
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,184
which you've never seen         
before, called a workspace.     

1142
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,485
Now when I create               
this workspace,                 

1143
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,620
it wants to know                
where to put it.                

1144
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,722
Be careful here, look,          

1145
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,957
it's trying to put it           
inside my Smashtag project,     

1146
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,325
which I don't wanna do that.    

1147
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:39,995
I wanna put it up the top       
of my Developer level here,     

1148
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,630
same place I put all            
of my projects, okay,           

1149
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,565
so really be                    
careful about that.             

1150
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,502
So I'm gonna call this L9,      
this is lecture 9, so           

1151
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:47,703
we'll call it L9.               

1152
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:50,006
And I hit Save, and             
this created this workspace.    

1153
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,341
But notice in the navigator,    
there's nothing there.          

1154
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,177
So what do we put               
in a workspace?                 

1155
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,980
Well, what we put in a          
workspace are other projects.   

1156
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,649
And this workspace is just      
gonna collect all those         

1157
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,651
projects, because they          
kind of go together.            

1158
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,821
And obviously, this Twitter     
framework that I'm providing    

1159
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,291
to you right here goes          
together with Smashtag,         

1160
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,694
which is this thing we've       
been working on so far.         

1161
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,830
Now what you drag down in       
here is the .xcodeproj,         

1162
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:18,334
because it's the project        
itself that you wanna put in    

1163
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,535
this workspace.                 

1164
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,670
So you just drag that in for    
both of them, so                

1165
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,639
I'm gonna open                  
this one as well.               

1166
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,609
Here's the Xcode project for    
this Twitter thing.             

1167
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,378
Drag in, now be careful         
not to put it inside,           

1168
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:32,481
see how that's trying to put    
it inside Smashtag there?       

1169
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,217
Put it outside, so              
that they're siblings.          

1170
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,454
Now I have this workspace       
right here that has two         

1171
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:43,359
projects in it, and you even    
go here and hide others.        

1172
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,028
And if we look in the Smashtag  
one, woo, looks familiar.       

1173
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,997
This is the code we were        
just working on, right?         

1174
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,599
If we look in the Twitter one,  

1175
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,134
this is the code I              
am providing you.               

1176
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,702
Now, what's in here?            

1177
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:56,005
Here's tweet which              
is this struct and              

1178
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,874
it's got all the things you     
would expect in a tweet.        

1179
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,210
The text of the tweet,          
the user who created it,        

1180
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,279
which is another thing,         
user right here,                

1181
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,082
and the user has a screen name  
that's at sign something,       

1182
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,318
the actual name, a unique       
identifier for the user.        

1183
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,888
Back to tweet, it's also        
got a unique identifier.        

1184
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,858
It's also got things that       
are embedded in the tweet like  

1185
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:16,858
other hashtags and              

1186
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,294
other users that are            
referenced inside the tweet.    

1187
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,163
And even media cuz you          
know a lot of times             

1188
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,899
tweets have an image            
with them too.                  

1189
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,301
And the other thing that's of   
importance in this Twitter      

1190
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,637
framework that I'm giving       
you is this class Request,      

1191
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,305
Twitter Request right here.     

1192
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,510
And this Request class is the   
thing you use to make requests  

1193
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,544
for Twitter.                    

1194
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,248
Now, you don't need to look     
at any of the implementation    

1195
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,683
of any of this, and             
in fact, you can go and         

1196
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,119
do assistant editor.            

1197
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:46,989
And if you do assistant editor  
on something like this,         

1198
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:50,426
you're actually gonna           
see its public API here.        

1199
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,229
See all those public,           
public public, public,          

1200
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,433
public; now we have not seen    
this public keyword before,     

1201
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,435
all we've seen is private or    
fileprivate.                    

1202
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,771
So what does this               
public thing mean?              

1203
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,608
Look, I put public in all       
this these things over here.    

1204
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:10,078
Public means that not only      
is it not private but           

1205
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,781
you can see it even if this     
framework is being used by      

1206
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,583
some other project.             

1207
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,754
So public means public outside  
of this framework, right,       

1208
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:19,421
make sense?                     

1209
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,656
So in UIKit a lot of            
things are marked public.       

1210
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,659
All the things you can use      
have to be marked public cuz    

1211
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,460
it's in a different             
framework than your app.        

1212
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:30,098
Your app is kind of             
a framework, in a sense, so     

1213
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:30,666
that's public.                  

1214
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,501
And then,                       
also notice farther down,       

1215
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,070
these methods are marked        
internal; that means I can      

1216
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,641
only use them inside my         
framework, so I can't call any  

1217
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,643
of these methods from           
Smashtag, they're internal.     

1218
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,412
This actually, you haven't      
seen this keyword because       

1219
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,449
it's the default, all the       
methods you've ever created     

1220
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:51,152
that you didn't mark private    
or fileprivate are internal.    

1221
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,221
It's the default, so            

1222
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,858
you haven't put the word        
internal there, okay.           

1223
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:56,859
So, let's look at               
the public API.                 

1224
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,994
Let's not even pay any          
attention to that, and          

1225
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,429
look at the public API.         

1226
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,398
This public API of Request,     
for making requests,            

1227
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,200
we're only going to             
use three things.               

1228
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,736
One is this convenience         
initializer                     

1229
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,205
where you just give it          
something to search for and     

1230
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,174
how many results you want.      

1231
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:15,010
And then this method            
fetchTweets where you just      

1232
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,314
give it this closure which      
it will call when it's done.    

1233
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,416
It's gonna go off and           
do it on another thread and     

1234
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,251
when it's done it will call.    

1235
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,653
And that's going to have an     
array of the tweets it found    

1236
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,389
that match your search.         

1237
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:28,724
what we're gonna use is this    
one down here, newer where if   

1238
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,991
And then last,                  

1239
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,161
you ask it a request,           
give me a newer request.        

1240
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,197
It'll give your request that    
you can use to get newer        

1241
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:35,731
tweets.                         

1242
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,065
Tweets that have                
been tweeted after              

1243
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,967
the previous one                
that you've got.                

1244
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,968
So, that's all we're            
gonna use here.                 

1245
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,905
We're not really gonna          
use any of the other API        

1246
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:43,939
in this request.                

1247
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:46,708
In your homework, you'll have   
to know this API here of        

1248
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,777
Tweet cause you'll have to      
be able to get the text and     

1249
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:52,047
the user information and        
also MediaItems so              

1250
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:57,285
you can get the URLs of images  
that are in there, etc.         

1251
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,521
But you never have to look at   
the private implementation of   

1252
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,924
this framework so don't even    
waste your time looking there.  

1253
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,026
Just look at things             
marked public,                  

1254
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:07,462
there's not a lot of things     
marked public- that's the only  

1255
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,698
thing you're going              
to look for.                    

1256
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,334
Now how do I use                
this framework,                 

1257
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,970
this Twitter framework          
in Smashtag?                    

1258
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,472
Well, you have to do one step.  

1259
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,807
You can't just put them         
in the same workspace and       

1260
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,075
start working.                  

1261
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:24,245
Well, two steps, one is I       
need to say import Twitter.     

1262
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,748
Just like I say import UIKit,   
if I want to use this Twitter   

1263
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,118
framework up here I have        
to say import Twitter.          

1264
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,620
That's gonna cause this         
tweet to start being            

1265
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,323
recognized as a type            
because it's gonna see this     

1266
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,292
tweet type right over here.     

1267
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,062
But the other important thing,  
don't forget,                   

1268
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:44,500
is you need to tell Xcode that  
when you build Smashtag that    

1269
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,269
app includes Twitter in it.     

1270
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,806
And you do that by going to     
the Smashtag project, okay,     

1271
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:51,640
the project settings.           

1272
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,175
And go all the way to           
the bottom where it says        

1273
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:54,776
Embedded Binaries.              

1274
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,980
And just pick up the product    
of your Twitter framework.      

1275
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,549
You see where it says           
Products right here?            

1276
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:04,653
Just pick that up and drag      
it in here, and that says,      

1277
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:08,891
please put Twitter              
framework into my Smashtag,     

1278
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,058
because my Smashtag uses it.    

1279
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,694
If you don't do this step,      
then it'll all compile but      

1280
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,130
then when Smashtag runs,        
Twitter won't be there, and     

1281
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:15,965
so it will fail.                

1282
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,068
Now, I'm gonna make you         
do that step as part of         

1283
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:20,969
your homework.                  

1284
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:23,638
I will post this code for       
Smashtag, but                   

1285
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,208
I'm not gonna post              
the workspace, so               

1286
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,945
you're gonna have to build      
the workspace on your own.      

1287
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:30,913
All right, so let's continue.   

1288
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,981
Now that we've got              
this array of tweets,           

1289
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,283
what are we gonna do with       
this array of tweets?           

1290
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:40,555
Let's start by doing a fetch    
for our search text.            

1291
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,790
So we got our search text,      

1292
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,092
we wanna go fetch all           
those things on there.          

1293
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,995
That's what we're supposed      
to do in search for tweets.     

1294
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,096
Let's make another              
function here,                  

1295
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,065
another little private func.    

1296
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,801
I'm gonna call it               
twitterRequest,                 

1297
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:56,104
which is gonna return           
a Twitter.Request.              

1298
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,973
But yeah,                       
here's another thing.           

1299
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,809
This I can call tweet because   
I'm importing this Twitter      

1300
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,678
framework and there's no        
other class called tweet, so    

1301
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:04,780
i just have to call it tweet.   

1302
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,983
Its full name is                
actually Twitter.Tweet.         

1303
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:11,720
Just like, you know,            
UITableViewController,          

1304
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:15,490
it's full name is               
UIKit.UITableViewController.    

1305
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,892
use Twitter.Tweet because I     
think in Assignment 5, you      

1306
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,226
Now i'm gonna                   

1307
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,530
might end up wanting to have    
you own local tweet class.      

1308
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,164
So I'm gonna use                
Twitter.Tweet and               

1309
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,034
Twitter.Request everywhere but  
I wouldn't have to as long as   

1310
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,670
I didn't have a class called    
Tweet or Request otherwise.     

1311
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,840
But this is a pretty generic    
name request so putting         

1312
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:35,644
the Twitter dot on front might  
be kind of a good idea anyway.  

1313
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,713
All right so                    

1314
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,282
the Twitter.Request function    
here is just going to return    

1315
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:44,386
a Twitter request that          
matches this search text.       

1316
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,420
And that's really,              
really simple,                  

1317
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,556
I'm just gonna say,             
if I can let the query for      

1318
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,393
the search term equal           
the search text.                

1319
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:55,030
And I wanna make sure that      
that query is not empty.        

1320
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,800
So I don't wanna search for     
nil or for the empty string.    

1321
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,503
So I'm just keeping that        
out of it right here.           

1322
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,305
And otherwise I'm just gonna    
return a Twitter request using  

1323
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,042
that convenient initializer I   
told you about called Search.   

1324
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,046
And I'm just gonna              
pass that query and,            

1325
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:12,781
well let's get 100 of them.     

1326
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,351
Okay, so we're gonna, we'll     
grab 100 tweets at a time.      

1327
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:20,188
And if that's not true,         
if the search term is nil or    

1328
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,391
it's empty, then I'm gonna      
return nil from this.           

1329
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,628
So let's make this be,          
you know, optional.             

1330
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:28,563
Okay, so everyone understand    
what this function does?        

1331
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,800
It just makes a Twitter         
request that will search for    

1332
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,036
our searchText,                 
that's all it does.             

1333
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,538
So now down here in             
searchForTweets,                

1334
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:41,343
I can say if I can let request  
equal the twitterRequest,       

1335
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:43,111
which hopefully it can make.    

1336
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,047
Okay, now I have a request.     

1337
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,819
Now I just need to cause        
that request to happen.         

1338
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:58,727
So I'm just gonna say this      
Twitter request.fetchTweets.    

1339
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:02,364
So this fetchTweets function    
right there, you see it?        

1340
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,765
The top one, okay,              

1341
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:07,603
it takes this closure           
right here as an argument.      

1342
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:11,172
I'm gonna double click on it,   
to show what it does here.      

1343
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,309
I'm going to use trailing       
closure syntax to get rid of    

1344
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,345
the parentheses there.          

1345
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,179
Now what's this?                

1346
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,648
This is the only                
argument in my closure.         

1347
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,783
Those are the tweets            
that it fetched.                

1348
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,351
See it's an array of tweets.    

1349
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,286
I'll call this newTweets.       

1350
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,522
Okay, so that's going to        
be an array of tweets,          

1351
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,490
I don't even need the           
parentheses here by the way.    

1352
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,192
So I have newTweets.            

1353
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,394
So newTweets is gonna be        
an array of Tweet that it       

1354
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:33,695
fetched; now, of course,        

1355
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,763
it's doing this off             
the main queue, right?          

1356
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,066
It's gotta go do that           
Twitter request,                

1357
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:40,168
what if it's a really           
slow network?                   

1358
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:43,572
Or Twitter is really slow       
that time or whatever.          

1359
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,106
I finally got these new tweets  
back, what do I wanna do?       

1360
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:46,573
So inside here,                 

1361
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:50,913
Well I just want to add them    
on to the end of my model,      

1362
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,748
Here's my model, it's           
an array of array of tweets.    

1363
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,516
right?                          

1364
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,853
Here's an array, so I'm just    
going to take my model, and     

1365
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,257
append onto it this             
array of tweets.                

1366
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,727
And actually, I'm not gonna     
append it on the end because    

1367
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,830
I want all my new tweets to     
show up at the beginning,       

1368
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,200
so in section zero              
at the beginning, so            

1369
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:14,369
I'm gonna insert these new      
tweets at 0 in my array.        

1370
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:15,570
So right at the top.            

1371
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,573
So my new tweets are gonna      
come in at the top.             

1372
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:19,374
Make sense?                     

1373
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,109
Now, we have an error there.    

1374
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:24,112
Can anyone guess why this       
error is here before I          

1375
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:24,746
open it?                        

1376
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:25,447
>> Mutating.                    

1377
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:27,249
>> What?                        
>> Yeah, mutating.              

1378
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:27,949
>> Mutating.                    

1379
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,484
That's a good guess but no.     

1380
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:34,489
It's because self, it's         
the old closure cycle problem,  

1381
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,490
right?                          

1382
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,392
Since we're                     
accessing self here,            

1383
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,228
these tweets as                 
part of our self.               

1384
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,630
We need to explicitly           
say that so                     

1385
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,433
that we can notice,             
we might have a memory cycle.   

1386
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,668
And do we have                  
a memory cycle here?            

1387
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,536
In fact we do.                  

1388
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,106
Because what if this view       
controller goes off to          

1389
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,374
fetch some tweets and           
it takes forever.               

1390
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,078
And so the person says, I'll    
search for something else.      

1391
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,014
Now they said the search        
text is on the else and         

1392
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,482
another fetch goes off.         

1393
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,652
And now here comes the first    
fetch and it's irrelevant now   

1394
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,453
because I already looked for    
something else.                 

1395
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,823
So we do here,                  
want to be careful to ignore    

1396
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:12,460
this when it comes back and we  
also, if someone searches and   

1397
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,130
it's taking forever and they    
hit back, we want our view      

1398
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,833
controllers to be able          
to leave memory as well.        

1399
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:19,701
So we don't want the closure,   
the cycle here,                 

1400
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,936
we don't want this closure      
holding our self in memory.     

1401
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,639
So we don't want this to        
be a strong pointer and         

1402
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,709
we need to check to make        
sure that when we get back,     

1403
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,877
it's still what                 
we're interested in.            

1404
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,880
So how can we                   
break this cycle?               

1405
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,915
We're just gonna use our        
friend weak self, okay?         

1406
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,882
That's easy.                    

1407
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,552
And that turns this             
into an optional.               

1408
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,253
So we added a question mark.    

1409
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,422
Boom, we broke that cycle.      

1410
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,457
So even if this fetch is        
sitting out there fetching,     

1411
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,325
it's not gonna be keeping our   
view controller in memory.      

1412
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,060
Our view control can            
leave memory, and               

1413
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:46,795
if it comes back and            

1414
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:49,897
it's gone, then this line       
of code will not execute.       

1415
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,267
How about dealing with the      
fact that our request might     

1416
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:53,635
have changed?                   

1417
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:54,969
Well, to do that,               

1418
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:59,073
I'm gonna have to keep track    
of our lastTwitterRequest,      

1419
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,211
actually we've got to           
put it inside here.             

1420
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:08,349
Okay, I'm gonna keep            
track of it, and                

1421
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:13,388
then in here I'm not going      
to do this unless our           

1422
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:18,060
request equals                  
the lastTwitterRequest.         

1423
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:21,029
So if this request that came    
back is not the last one we     

1424
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,797
issued, then I'm                
not gonna do it.                

1425
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,866
And so let me go up here and    

1426
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:28,169
say private var                 
lastTwitterRequest and          

1427
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:32,907
that's going to be              
a Twitter.Request of course.    

1428
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:38,079
Request, optional,              
is not always set.              

1429
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,914
Everyone kinda see              
what I'm doing there?           

1430
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,583
And of course this is saying    
self again, so we'll put self   

1431
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,920
in there and of course self     
is weak so we'll do that.       

1432
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:46,988
So that's all good.             

1433
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,957
Any other problems you          
can see with this?              

1434
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,493
I don't see any so far.         

1435
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,428
So it's all good.               
So,                             

1436
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,363
before we go hooking            
up our table view,              

1437
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:59,167
let's just make sure that our   
Twitter fetches are working.    

1438
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,137
And I'm gonna do that           
by putting a didSet             

1439
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:06,007
up here on my model, and        
every time my model changes,    

1440
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,310
I'm just gonna print            
the tweets out.                 

1441
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,778
Now luckily I've made it so     

1442
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,979
the tweet is                    
CustomStringConvertible,        

1443
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,615
it implements description.      

1444
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,383
It can print itself             
as a string so                  

1445
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:16,885
this is an array of those.      

1446
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,521
So this will print out          
an array, actually an array     

1447
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,224
of an array of this tweet       
printed out as a string.        

1448
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:26,294
So we're just gonna             
print it out there.             

1449
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,695
Just seems like                 
it should work?                 

1450
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,865
Let's go give it a try and      
find out.                       

1451
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,068
We'll do this on iPhone 7.      

1452
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,706
Pay attention right             
now because this                

1453
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,742
is not in fact going to work.   

1454
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,177
And this won't work for you     
either and you're gonna need    

1455
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,581
to do a couple of things to     
make a Twitter fetch work.      

1456
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,951
By the way you see we have      
these prototype cells that      

1457
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,055
have to have reuse              
identifiers; gotta remember to  

1458
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:55,356
fix that later.                 

1459
00:59:55,425 --> 01:00:00,762
Alright, so we run, and look    
at this thing it puts up here,  

1460
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,964
Smashtag would like to          
access Twitter accounts.        

1461
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:05,166
So you're not allowed to        
write an app that just starts   

1462
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:07,935
posting things for people on    
Twitter behind the scenes.      

1463
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,806
Okay, when you write an app     
it is always going to ask,      

1464
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,709
the first time you try to use   
Twitter, whether it's allowed.  

1465
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,513
So I'll click okay, and let's   
go look in our console and      

1466
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:19,214
see if it printed.              

1467
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,218
It didn't, all it printed out   
here is, couldn't discover      

1468
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,689
Twitter account type, hm,       
why would it say that?          

1469
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:31,026
Well, that's because your       
simulator, it's just a device,  

1470
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,229
it needs to have Twitter,       
a Twitter account, basically,   

1471
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,463
your device needs               
a Twitter account, so           

1472
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:36,331
where do we set that?           

1473
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,299
So let's go back                
to our simulator,               

1474
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:42,737
here it is, I'm gonna go        
hardware, home button, okay,    

1475
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,405
you can also do command,        
shift, F.                       

1476
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,306
Is hardware home button.        

1477
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:49,477
And I'm gonna go over to the    
Settings app on my simulator.   

1478
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:51,512
But you can do it on            
your device as well.            

1479
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,082
And if you go down in           
settings, here's Twitter.       

1480
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:54,916
Look at that.                   

1481
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:55,550
Twitter right there.            

1482
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,218
And here's where                
you type in your                

1483
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,386
Twitter username and password.  

1484
01:00:58,455 --> 01:00:59,854
And if you don't type this in,  

1485
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:03,391
then no apps on your            
system can access Twitter.      

1486
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,094
Cuz how would they- they'd      
have to know who you are.       

1487
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,730
So I'm gonna type this here,    
I'm gonna do it off screen cuz  

1488
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,466
I don't want you to             
see my password.                

1489
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,269
So now I am logged              
in on Twitter.                  

1490
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:17,139
So now if I go back and         
start my app                    

1491
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,876
It will both be in allowed      
because I clicked OK.           

1492
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:23,878
And I'll be logged in so        

1493
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:25,980
it'll have an actual Twitter    
user that can do it.            

1494
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,782
And sure enough,                
look down here at the bottom.   

1495
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,186
We're getting all kinds of      
tweets being printed out here.  

1496
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,387
So here's a tweet.              

1497
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,756
Here's its unique ID.           

1498
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,691
Here's the person               
who tweeted it.                 

1499
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,559
Here's when it was tweeted.     

1500
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,729
Here is the text of the tweet.  

1501
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,432
This one's got                  
an embedded URL, etc.           

1502
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:45,700
So we're doing well.            

1503
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,702
We've got our                   
tweets coming in.               

1504
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,638
So now all we need to do        
is load them up into our        

1505
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,506
table view.                     

1506
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,608
So what do we need to do        
to load this thing up in        

1507
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:54,409
the table view?                 

1508
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:57,879
Now, surprisingly simple        
actually, the two pieces we     

1509
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:01,249
have to do, one is every time   
we change our model we have     

1510
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:04,519
to tell the table view that     
it changed and then we have     

1511
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,989
to implement those table        
view data source methods.       

1512
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,323
So let's start with             
the first one.                  

1513
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,760
Actually we have already        
changed our model once.         

1514
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,962
Right here,                     
we changed our model and        

1515
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,965
we told the table view          
about it, so that's good.       

1516
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,001
Here we're changing our model.  

1517
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,137
So we need to tell              
the table view about it.        

1518
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,207
So self?.tableView.             

1519
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:27,909
And what did I do               
here to my model?               

1520
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,611
I just inserted a section       
at the beginning.               

1521
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,882
So there happens to be          
a tableView method called       

1522
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,484
insertSection.                  

1523
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,419
And it just says,               
you inserted some sections.     

1524
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,720
Which ones?                     

1525
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,289
ask you about those and         
put the rows in there for you.  

1526
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,790
I will go and                   

1527
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,792
And this sections               
is an index set,                

1528
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,428
which you can give              
it an array literal.            

1529
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,697
So I just inserted              
section zero.                   

1530
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,066
So I'll just put an array       
with just zero in it.           

1531
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,702
And I'm gonna use               
the fade animation              

1532
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,138
to show that fading in.         

1533
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,507
So, insertSections.             

1534
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,777
So, this is me telling the      
tableView, I changed my model,  

1535
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,379
so ask me again.                

1536
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,780
Ask me those tableView          
data source.                    

1537
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,483
Now, since I told it exactly    
what I did it's only gonna ask  

1538
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,252
me about that section, which    
is nice, higher performance.    

1539
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,488
Then reloadData,                
the hammer reloadData,          

1540
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,124
in which case it would ask me   
for all rows in all sections    

1541
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:20,361
again; so here I know           
exactly what I did.             

1542
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:24,365
Now this actually is            
dangerous code here.            

1543
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,334
This is really easy to          
add this line of code and       

1544
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,102
now your app just acts weird.   

1545
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,204
It just acts weird              
all the time.                   

1546
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,240
Can anyone, want,               
guess why this                  

1547
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,144
adding this line of code would  
cause my app to go all weird?   

1548
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,149
It's because this               
is a UI call.                   

1549
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:46,153
And what queue are we on here?  

1550
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,622
Some queue,                     
not the main queue.             

1551
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,725
Whatever queue we fetched       
those tweets on, okay?          

1552
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,159
So we're not on                 
the main queue.                 

1553
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,862
So we can't make                
a UI call here.                 

1554
01:03:54,931 --> 01:04:00,035
Right, so we have to dispatch   
this back to the main queue.    

1555
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,138
So this is something that,      

1556
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,839
will just take some             
getting used to for             

1557
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,474
you guys with this              
multithreading,                 

1558
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:08,910
cuz you're gonna do these       
things in this other queue,     

1559
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,479
and you're gonna update         
your table view, and then       

1560
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,215
it's like what's going on my    
app is just acting so strange.  

1561
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,817
And that's why-                 
because you can do              

1562
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,151
UI stuff on the main queue.     

1563
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,387
And it's not gonna warn you or  
necessarily crash,              

1564
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,023
it might eventually crash,      
it's just gonna act all weird.  

1565
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:27,161
So, fixed that.                 

1566
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,096
This is good.                   

1567
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:30,064
We've got the table view        
updating our model and we've    

1568
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,333
got the table view knowing      
about change to the model.      

1569
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:35,236
So now all we need to           
do is implement this            

1570
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,707
UITableViewDataSource protocol  
so                              

1571
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:42,077
that it can get                 
the data from us.               

1572
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,044
So let's do it.                 

1573
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:47,849
Number of sections, how many    
sections are in our table?      

1574
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,784
Anyone know?                    

1575
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:54,488
Yeah.                           

1576
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,992
Exactly, candy thrown at you    
cuz that's exactly right.       

1577
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,426
tweets.count.                   

1578
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:03,464
It's just the number of arrays  
that we have in our model here  

1579
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:07,602
because each of this arrays     
inside here are a section, so   

1580
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:08,502
perfect.                        

1581
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,106
And then what about this one?   

1582
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:15,443
Here we're being asked how      
many rows are there in tweets   

1583
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,044
subsection?                     

1584
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,215
That's just count also.         

1585
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,484
So we've designed our           
data structure so               

1586
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,152
that these are super            
easy to implement,              

1587
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,888
which I highly recommend        
if you can do it.               

1588
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:27,788
You can't always do it.         

1589
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,758
But if you can it's nice.       

1590
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:32,527
So now a little more            
difficult, only a little        

1591
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:35,596
though, is cellForRowAt         
index path right here.          

1592
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,666
So here's where we have to      
return the UITableViewCell      

1593
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:40,435
that we're gonna use to draw.   

1594
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:44,238
Now, let's go back to           
our Storyboard here and         

1595
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:48,242
let's just start out            
with something simple.          

1596
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:51,579
Let's try using here            
a subtitle cell.                

1597
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,048
So I'm gonna click              
on this cell.                   

1598
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,616
And will change its             
style from being custom         

1599
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:56,784
to being subtitle.              

1600
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:57,718
So there's title and subtitle.  

1601
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,655
And I'm gonna set the title to  
be the text with the tweet.     

1602
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,089
And I'm gonna set the subtitle  

1603
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,525
to be the person                
who tweeted it.                 

1604
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,895
So let's try that and           
see how that looks.             

1605
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,597
So how am I gonna do that?      

1606
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,266
Two things I need to do here.   

1607
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:14,001
One is I need to dequeue        
a reusable cell, and            

1608
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:19,407
I to tell iOS which             
prototype to use,               

1609
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,742
which prototype in              
the Storyboard.                 

1610
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,377
So lets go back to              
our Storyboard.                 

1611
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:24,879
And I only have one prototype.  

1612
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:25,613
It's this one.                  

1613
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,048
That's the one I wanna use.     

1614
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:28,549
So I need to give               
it an identifier.               

1615
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,884
I'm gonna call it Tweet,        

1616
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:32,386
because that's what             
this cell shows.                

1617
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,287
It shows a tweet.               

1618
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,490
Notice that caused my           
warning to go away.             

1619
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,957
Because all these               
prototype cells                 

1620
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:38,760
always need an identifier.      

1621
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,127
And now when I go back here,    

1622
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,631
I can change this from          
reuseIdentifier to Tweet.       

1623
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,468
Okay, so now, I am able         
to dequeueReusableCell          

1624
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,071
that will be a copy of that     
prototype that's subtitled.     

1625
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,741
So all my rows are gonna        
be subtitle rows.               

1626
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,076
So now I've got this cell,      

1627
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,512
it's of type                    
UITableViewCell by the way,     

1628
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,781
since it's a standard           
type not a custom type.         

1629
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,748
How do I configure it?          

1630
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,785
Well, for me to configure the   
cells, to set the title and     

1631
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,787
I need to know which Tweet      
it's asking me for here.        

1632
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,722
the subtitle,                   

1633
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,657
And I know which Tweet          
it's asking because it's        

1634
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,859
saying cellForRowAt.            

1635
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:15,897
This is the row that's          
the tweet that is asking        

1636
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:20,101
me to give it                   
a UITableViewCell for.          

1637
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:25,306
So I'm gonna let tweet equal    

1638
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:32,046
my model sub                    
indexPath.section and           

1639
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:35,550
indexPath.row.                  

1640
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,352
So I'm just getting this        
row in this section,            

1641
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,322
this gets the first array,      
the section,                    

1642
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,790
I'm just getting                
the row out of it.              

1643
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,427
So now I got the tweet, so      
now I can just update the cell  

1644
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:51,598
really easily, cell.textLabel.  

1645
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,801
It might be an optional         
?.text equals,                  

1646
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,638
let's have that be              
the tweet's text.               

1647
01:07:56,706 --> 01:08:00,174
This is something that          
you'll see in here, we go to    

1648
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:03,711
the Twitter, and look for the   
Twitter framework at Tweet,     

1649
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,014
and you'll see that the very    
first one in fact, is text.     

1650
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:11,018
And then we'll make this        
cell detailTextLabel,           

1651
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:15,589
its text will be the tweet's    
user's name, let's say.         

1652
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:20,261
So again, Tweet,                
user, username.                 

1653
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:24,265
So, that's why I'm              
getting that information.       

1654
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:25,366
Do you understand that?         

1655
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,934
Part of it, okay?               

1656
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,736
So, that I'll came              
out of this Tweet.              

1657
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,272
This is of type Tweet.          

1658
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,442
Everybody got that?             

1659
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:40,014
All right, so is that it?       

1660
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,684
Do we need to do anything else  
to hook this thing up and       

1661
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:44,552
make it work?                   

1662
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,921
Turns out no.                   

1663
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,956
So let's just run.              

1664
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,094
Okay, there it is.              

1665
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,362
The world's greatest            
Twitter client.                 

1666
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:55,963
Look at that.                   

1667
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:56,965
It looks beautiful.             

1668
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:58,832
No, of course, in fact,         

1669
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,469
this is the world's ugliest     
Twitter client right here.      

1670
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:02,470
But it is working.              

1671
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:03,704
These are tweets.               

1672
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,073
But anyway, you can see         
here's the tweets and           

1673
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,110
here are the person             
who tweeted it.                 

1674
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,414
Now obviously,                  
this is awful UI.               

1675
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,648
Just absolutely horrendous UI.  

1676
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,918
You would never have            
a Twitter client like this.     

1677
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,954
We want our UI in these         
cells to look much nicer,       

1678
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,190
much more customized            
to a tweet.                     

1679
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:24,759
So we're gonna go back          
to our Storyboard here.         

1680
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:28,963
And instead of using this       
awful subtitle style cell,      

1681
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,631
we're gonna build               
a custom cell.                  

1682
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:35,236
And this custom cell is gonna   
have more good looking and      

1683
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:38,672
more of the data that           
comes with a Tweet.             

1684
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:39,840
So let's just build it.         

1685
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:43,611
Let's go here and make this a   
little bigger, make some room.  

1686
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,312
All right, I'm gonna grab       
some labels out of here.        

1687
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,982
There's a label,                
this will maybe be,             

1688
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:49,584
let's say this is the Tweeter.  

1689
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:51,753
This is the person              
who's doing the Tweet.          

1690
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:55,089
By the way, this is a case      
where we're showing user        

1691
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,190
content really.                 

1692
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:57,625
These tweets are content.       

1693
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,793
They're not like the title      
of a button or something,       

1694
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,030
it's actually the content that  
the user has requested to see.  

1695
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:04,598
So I'm gonna use a font here.   

1696
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:05,400
You see this font?              

1697
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:06,867
I'm not gonna use               
the system font.                

1698
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:10,137
I'm going to go down and        
start using this text styles.   

1699
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,940
So the Tweeter is going         
to be at the top.               

1700
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,509
I'm gonna have that             
be a headline font.             

1701
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,378
So this is gonna be             
the headline font and           

1702
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:20,415
this could change over time,    
okay, whatever the system       

1703
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,050
thinks headline font is and     
it'll be true in every app.     

1704
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,087
The headline will always be     
using this font in every app    

1705
01:10:26,156 --> 01:10:28,389
and users could even            
go into settings and            

1706
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,124
change the size                 
of their fonts.                 

1707
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,225
If they're like me and          

1708
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:33,995
they're visions going           
they can set them bigger.       

1709
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:37,332
And the fonts will get          
bigger automatically so         

1710
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,101
ther's big advantage to         
using these font styles.        

1711
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,703
So there's that one.            

1712
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:45,138
There is the text of            
the tweet itself, so            

1713
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,675
we'll just call that text.      

1714
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,310
maybe a good font is body font  
because this is really, this    

1715
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,877
For this one,                   

1716
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:53,281
is the heart of what we're      
doing here, this body thing.    

1717
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,217
One thing that's kinda cool     
with UILabel, the text          

1718
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,252
in the tweet is probably        
gonna be multiple lines, and    

1719
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,387
it's gonna wrap.                

1720
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,389
When you have a UI              
label like that,                

1721
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:05,760
you wanna set this              
property lines to be zero.      

1722
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:09,230
If you have zero predefined     
lines then the UILabel          

1723
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,199
will be however many            
lines it needs to be fit        

1724
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,136
the information with wrapping.  

1725
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:18,473
Whereas this one is line        
one this all one line.          

1726
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:22,443
And if it's too long it just    
gets dot dot dot at the end,    

1727
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,310
all right?                      

1728
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,311
What else do I wanna do here?   

1729
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,547
Let's do another                
label here for                  

1730
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:30,251
when the tweet was tweeted      
out, when it was created.       

1731
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,321
That one is probably something  
like a caption, we'll say.      

1732
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,624
Small little text               
at the bottom.                  

1733
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:40,094
We'll go ahead and              
center than right there.        

1734
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:41,895
Let's also get an image.        

1735
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,131
Let's go down and               
find the image view down here.  

1736
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:44,832
Where is our image view?        

1737
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:45,666
Here it is.                     

1738
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:48,202
Drag it out here.               
This is gonna be the profile    

1739
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,970
image of the Tweeter.           

1740
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,607
So whoever tweeted this will    
have their little image here.   

1741
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:54,575
This one, by the way,           

1742
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,879
I don't know how big profile    
images are on Twitter.          

1743
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,447
And I don't care because        
I'm gonna make this thing       

1744
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,216
always be a fixed size.         

1745
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:05,419
So how do we make an image      
like this be a fixed size       

1746
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,153
using auto layout?              

1747
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:09,924
And it turns out what you do    
is you Ctrl+Drag to itself.     

1748
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,058
And when you do,                

1749
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:14,662
you'll see that you have        
the option to fix its width.    

1750
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,130
And you can Ctrl+Drag,          
and fix its height.             

1751
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,899
You can also to both            
at the same time.               

1752
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,402
And, so what width and          
height has it fixed it to?      

1753
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,871
Well, we can look over here     
in the size inspector,          

1754
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,873
and see that it's               
fixed it to 71 by 67.           

1755
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:30,878
That doesn't sound very         
computer science-y,             

1756
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:34,315
I'm gonna fix it to 64 by 64.   

1757
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:35,416
So I've made it so              

1758
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:38,352
this image view is always       
gonna be 64 by 64.              

1759
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,455
I don't care how big the        
person's actual profile image   

1760
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,690
is, I always want               
it to be that way.              

1761
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,592
Okay, so there's another        
little auto layout              

1762
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,426
tidbit for you.                 

1763
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,512
speaking of auto layouts,       
I need to lay this stuff out.   

1764
01:12:48,513 --> 01:12:49,896
All right, so                   

1765
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:52,700
I kinda want it to look,        
eh, something like this.        

1766
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:53,801
See what I mean?                

1767
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,370
Approximately, and so           
I'm just gonna use stack view.  

1768
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:01,475
So we'll stack those two        
things together, like that.     

1769
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,877
Look at our things here,        
fill and fill.                  

1770
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,845
That's perfectly fine.          

1771
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,580
Let's go over here.             

1772
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:07,615
Let's stack those together.     

1773
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,783
That's fill and fill.           

1774
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,353
One thing about these two,      
by the way, they're gonna be    

1775
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,556
sharing the space in            
this stack view equally.        

1776
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,494
But I don't want them           
sharing equally.                

1777
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:24,065
I actually want the text        
to get more of this space.      

1778
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,967
So I'm gonna click              
on the Tweeter.                 

1779
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,069
And I'm gonna go over           
to this size inspector.         

1780
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,404
And I'm gonna do                
something cool,                 

1781
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,573
which is set its content        
hugging priority.               

1782
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,209
I'm gonna set its               
vertical content                

1783
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:37,911
hugging priority to be          
higher than the other one.      

1784
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:38,612
So they're both 251.            

1785
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,282
You see, that one's 251,        
that one's 251.                 

1786
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:43,083
So I'm gonna set                
this one to be 300,             

1787
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,451
just anything higher than 251.  

1788
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,454
And that means that when        
the space is being allocated    

1789
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:48,389
between this tweeter and        

1790
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:52,360
the text, it's gonna hug        
the tweeter's content.          

1791
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:55,229
And the text is gonna           
get all the rest.               

1792
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:56,330
So that's a way                 
that you can kinda,             

1793
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:59,834
when you're sharing space       
between two things.             

1794
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:03,370
All right, so now let's         
put these two in a stack.       

1795
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,142
Maybe we'll put some spacing    
here, something like that.      

1796
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,911
Alignment here, top is good,    
I want them both at the top.    

1797
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,148
I think that's good,            
lined up at the top.            

1798
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,451
If I like that and              
fill is fine, I've got this.    

1799
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,119
Now I'm gonna do the same       
thing we did before,            

1800
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,355
which is I'm gonna put          
this in the corner.             

1801
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,425
And I'm gonna Ctrl              
drag to the top.                

1802
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:28,028
I'm gonna Ctrl drag             
to the leading edge.            

1803
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:31,098
I'm gonna Ctrl drag             
to the trailing edge.           

1804
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,000
And I'm gonna Ctrl drag         
to the bottom edge.             

1805
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,035
So I want that out there.       

1806
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,136
And again, the same thing.      

1807
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:39,640
I'm gonna take this and change  
it to standard if I can.        

1808
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:40,907
I can't, so we'll go 0.         

1809
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,443
And same thing here.            

1810
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:47,915
Standard if I can,              
can't, we'll do 0.              

1811
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,551
So I've made this stock         
view that contains all          

1812
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,819
the stuff fit in there.         

1813
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:56,123
So I basically done the auto    
layout necessary to make this   

1814
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:58,759
thing use the space properly.   

1815
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,662
And I can still change the      
size of the cell, all right?    

1816
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,998
I can click on it and I can     
make it a little bit smaller    

1817
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,634
and all that stuff is           
going to, you know,             

1818
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:08,435
stick to the edges,             
so that'll be fine.             

1819
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,836
Now, this is great,             

1820
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,240
in fact if we go back to our    
table view controller and       

1821
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,110
if I comment out this cell      
configuration because we don't  

1822
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:20,848
have a subtitle so these don't  
make any sense any more.        

1823
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:24,084
And we run, then we gonna       
see that our UI hopefully,      

1824
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:26,220
if we didn't forget anything.   

1825
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,791
It's going to look in some      
ways a little better.           

1826
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,226
Yeah, so                        
it kinda looks better.          

1827
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:35,496
Now, the only thing that's not  
better is we lost our data      

1828
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:38,899
because I commented out         
the data loading right here.    

1829
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:41,902
So this is what we want UI      
to look like basically with     

1830
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,403
an image here and that there.   

1831
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,472
But we need to set              
all this data.                  

1832
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,406
So how do we that?              

1833
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,109
Since this is a custom          
cell over here.                 

1834
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:51,845
We have to do with              
a custom subclass               

1835
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,215
of this UI table view           
cell right here.                

1836
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,983
So, I'm gonna create            
one of those, New File.         

1837
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:01,255
Let's go here and New File.     

1838
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,691
Again, Cocoa Touch Class;       
this time though,               

1839
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,127
it's not a TableViewController  
it's a TableViewCell.           

1840
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,029
I'm gonna call it               
TweetTableViewCell cuz          

1841
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:10,998
it shows the tweet,             

1842
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:15,002
put in the same place as all    
the rest of my stuff there.     

1843
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,772
Here's my table table view      
cell, it gives me awakeFromNib  

1844
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,340
which is kinda nice but I       
don't need it and setSelected   

1845
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,843
I don't do anything special     
when my table view cell is      

1846
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,413
selected but I could, I could   
draw a blue background or       

1847
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:28,549
something like that if          
I wanted, but I don't.          

1848
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:30,750
So, I have this                 
TableViewCell subclass.         

1849
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,586
I'm gonna go back to            
my Storyboard and               

1850
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,322
make sure that I                
set the identity,               

1851
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:37,124
don't forget this step.         

1852
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:40,294
Set the identity to be          
a TweetTableViewCell.           

1853
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,361
If you forget this step,        

1854
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,464
you won't be able to do any     
outlets or anything like that.  

1855
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,269
Now, I wanna wire outlets       
up to this new class I          

1856
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,471
just created, so I need to      
get them both on screen,        

1857
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,373
I'll show you kind of           
a cool way to do that.          

1858
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,408
Let's get the assistant         
editor up here,                 

1859
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:56,377
remember I could do manual,     
blah, blah, blah,               

1860
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,680
but another way is to hold      
down the option key, and        

1861
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:02,249
just click on the thing that    
you want to be on the right,    

1862
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,852
I think I showed this before,   
but option                      

1863
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:08,956
clicking in the navigator will  
put that thing on the right.    

1864
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:13,093
All right so let's move this    
over more, some space there.    

1865
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:15,196
All right, so I need to wire    
up outlets to these four        

1866
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:17,164
things, right, the tweet or     
the text or the image.          

1867
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:18,465
So let's just do that.          

1868
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:19,800
We'll go here, Ctrl+drag,       

1869
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:24,437
screen out, I'll call this my   
tweet, what did I call this,    

1870
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:30,177
my tweetProfileImageView.       

1871
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,279
Cuz it's gonna be               
a UIImageView that shows        

1872
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,915
the Tweeter's profile.          

1873
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,419
Let's do the little             
create down here,               

1874
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,021
Ctrl+Drag, from that.           

1875
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:43,924
We'll call that                 
tweetCreatedLabel.              

1876
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,693
To label it.                    

1877
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,497
Shows when it was created;      
let's do out little tweeter     

1878
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:55,269
right here and we call          
that our tweetUserLabel,        

1879
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,871
this is gonna show              
the label of the tweet          

1880
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,540
user and then we have the text  
right here that's gonna show    

1881
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,943
the actual tweetText,           
tweetTextLabel.                 

1882
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:09,950
So I've got these nice          
little outlets right here.      

1883
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,620
Now of course I need to be      
able to set these outlets with  

1884
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:16,323
something and here's where      
I need public API in my         

1885
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:19,994
table view cell, that gives me  
the data I need to do that.     

1886
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:23,898
And I'm just going to have      
my public API be tweet,         

1887
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:27,400
give me the Twitter.Tweet       
that you want and               

1888
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,170
I'll load these babies up.      

1889
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:30,971
That's what it's saying here.   

1890
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,541
Of course we need               
to import Twitter.              

1891
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:37,144
Cuz we're using                 
it in this class.               

1892
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,781
And when you set this Tweet     
I'm just going to on didSet.    

1893
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:43,150
Update my UI just like          
I was a controller but          

1894
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:46,120
I'm not, I'm not a controller,  
I'm a view actually.            

1895
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:49,723
It's the only time a view       
can have these outlets.         

1896
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:54,095
So I need some private          
func to do that updateUI.       

1897
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,000
Now, time is running            
a little bit short here, so     

1898
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,569
I'm just going to type          
this in real quick              

1899
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:04,571
I believe I have tweet cell.    

1900
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,506
There it is, okay?              

1901
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:07,875
But you can look                
at this later.                  

1902
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:10,343
But I'm just basically          
setting all the outlets here.   

1903
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,013
See how I'm just setting these  
outlets like setting the tweet  

1904
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,282
label, text to be               
the tweet's text,               

1905
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,252
setting the user label to       
be the user description.        

1906
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:20,521
Notice by the way I'm blocking  
the main thread here.           

1907
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:25,458
If this was my homework,        
bam I just got dinged.          

1908
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,361
So make sure you fix this,      
okay?                           

1909
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,497
If you're gonna use my code     
in any way in your homework,    

1910
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:31,865
which you probably want to,     

1911
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,434
then you're gonna               
wanna fix this.                 

1912
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,669
Don't do this on                
the main thread.                

1913
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:36,904
Don't block the main thread.    

1914
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,173
But, does anyone understand     
what updateUI is doing here?    

1915
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:41,041
It's just taking this           
Tweet that I was giving,        

1916
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,742
and loading this up.            

1917
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,544
And this is happening over and  
over for                        

1918
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,681
every row in the table          
that gets displayed.            

1919
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,550
This is happening, the copy of  
this class has been made and    

1920
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,852
this is happening.              

1921
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,720
Now, how do we set this?        

1922
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:58,692
We set this back over here and  
our TweetTableViewController.   

1923
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:02,429
In the same place that we       
configured the cell here for    

1924
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,197
the subtitle one.               

1925
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,000
And in fact, I still need the   
tweet, but I don't need that.   

1926
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,368
I'll leave those there, so      

1927
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,804
you can remember that code      
when you look at it later.      

1928
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,807
But instead of setting          
those things, I just want       

1929
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,277
to set that tweet, I wanna      
set this var right here.        

1930
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,046
But for                         
me to set the var right here,   

1931
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:21,281
I need to get my table          
view to be one of these.        

1932
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,349
So, I need to use an as.        

1933
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:24,484
So, I'm gonna say,              

1934
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:28,655
if I can let the tweetCell      
equal the cell,                 

1935
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:34,494
this reusable cell that I got,  
as a TweetTableViewCell,        

1936
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:39,600
then, I can say, cell set       
your tweet to be my tweet.      

1937
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:44,605
That goes in this row,          
section, and row.               

1938
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:51,578
Now, we set the, what,          
sorry, tweetCell.tweet.         

1939
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:55,215
We set the class of these,      
of this prototype right here,   

1940
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:57,484
the prototype for this cell.    

1941
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,018
We set it with the identity     

1942
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,722
inspector to be                 
a TweetTableViewCell.           

1943
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,790
So, when we come in here,       
it will, in fact,               

1944
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,425
this as will work.              

1945
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:08,161
Okay, it will be a              
TweetTableViewCell cuz we said  

1946
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,532
that in the Storyboard, so,     
it created that kind of thing,  

1947
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,198
all right?                      

1948
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,634
So, let see if this works.      

1949
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:19,806
Okay, it is working.            

1950
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,743
Look, we've got the time        
the person tweeted this,        

1951
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:24,711
it's got the person             
who tweeted it,                 

1952
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:28,682
it's got the text of the        
tweeting, but we get no image.  

1953
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:32,152
Why didn't we get               
people's images here?           

1954
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,520
Okay, why do you think          
we didn't get these,            

1955
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,222
these images?                   

1956
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,657
Well, let's go look             
at our console.                 

1957
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,058
What does it say?               

1958
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:39,626
No!                             

1959
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:41,428
App Transport Security.         

1960
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,597
You recognize that              
from last time?                 

1961
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:47,601
It's because these profiles     
are http something not          

1962
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,102
https something.                

1963
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:50,371
So, we know how to fix that.    

1964
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,240
We'll just go back to           
Info.plist right here.          

1965
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,877
And add a row for               
App Transport Security.         

1966
01:21:56,946 --> 01:22:01,348
We'll open that up, we'll       
add Arbitrary Loads here,       

1967
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:05,619
we'll make that be, yes,        
we allow arbitrary loads.       

1968
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:07,086
There's another                 
problem here though.            

1969
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,422
Look at all these tweets.       

1970
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,157
Look how they're cut off,       
you see?                        

1971
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:14,928
Every row is the same size and  
it's not big enough for         

1972
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:15,729
most of the tweets.             

1973
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,831
It's just dot, dot,             
dot, dot, dot, dot.             

1974
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,801
Wouldn't it be cool if these    
rows could be different sizes   

1975
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,969
depending on how                
big the tweet is?               

1976
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,604
Well, of course                 
we can do that.                 

1977
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:25,672
Let's do it.                    

1978
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,508
Let's go see how this size      
is being said right now.        

1979
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,411
Right now, it's being said,     
if we go and                    

1980
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,782
inspect this cell in its        
size inspector, look,           

1981
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:38,552
the row height is 96, so,       
every single row is 96.         

1982
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,156
What we wanna do is in our      
viewDidLoad right here,         

1983
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:47,827
we wanna say that our           
tableView's row height is not   

1984
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:52,432
96, it's                        
UITableViewAutomaticDimension.  

1985
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:55,869
But as I said before, we also   
want to give it a little help   

1986
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:59,439
by setting its estimated        
row height to something.        

1987
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:00,073
And I'll tell you what,         

1988
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,841
let's set it to what's          
in the Storyboard.              

1989
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,811
tableView.rowHeight, okay?      

1990
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,879
So, I'm getting the rowHeight   
out of the Storyboard,          

1991
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:08,114
using it as the estimate.       

1992
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,049
And then, I'm resetting         

1993
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:10,918
the rowHeight to be             
the AutomaticDimension.         

1994
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:19,059
And sure enough, see, look,     

1995
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:20,928
this tall tweet is              
getting extra space and         

1996
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,530
some of the smaller tweets,     
I don't know if we have any,    

1997
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,766
you can probably see            
it if we go like this.          

1998
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:30,370
The smaller tweets              
get less space, okay?           

1999
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,838
So, that's good.                

2000
01:23:31,907 --> 01:23:35,275
We're out of time, so,          
if you have to go, feel free.   

2001
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,077
The last thing I'm gonna do     
here in a little over time is   

2002
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,580
add a text field at the top     
that lets us type in what       

2003
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,750
we wanna search for instead of  
always looking for Stanford.    

2004
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:46,420
So, we're gonna get Stanford    
out of there, okay?             

2005
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:47,387
So, how do we do that?          

2006
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:48,254
It's real easy.                 

2007
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,656
We have, if you remember,       

2008
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,225
the table view, it's got this   
little header view at the top.  

2009
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,527
So, I'm just gonna              
take a UITextField.             

2010
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,396
Remember this editable text     
field we learned about in       

2011
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:57,130
the last lecture?               

2012
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,665
And I'm gonna put               
it on the top.                  

2013
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,601
It's a little hard, sometimes,  
to see where it's going,        

2014
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,237
but when it looks like this,    
the width of the table, then,   

2015
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:06,139
you've got it,                  
it's dropping it in there.      

2016
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,742
It's also a little hard         
to select and click on.         

2017
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:11,444
So, you're gonna wanna use      
that Ctrl + Shift + Click.      

2018
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:13,713
And that way, you can pick      
either the controller, or       

2019
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,449
the table view, or              
in this case, the text field.   

2020
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,318
I'm gonna inspect it and        
change it a little bit.         

2021
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,221
I'm just gonna make the font    
a little bit bigger,            

2022
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,255
we'll say 22.                   

2023
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,991
Now, notice I can also set all  
those text field things I was   

2024
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,792
talking about.                  

2025
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:27,694
Like, I don't want              
it auto-correcting.             

2026
01:24:27,763 --> 01:24:30,931
I don't wanna say, search for   
hashtag SuperBowl and           

2027
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,734
change it hashtag               
SuperSpaceBowl, okay?           

2028
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:35,435
So, I don't want any            
correction going on.            

2029
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:36,803
Keyboard type, ooh, look,       

2030
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,405
there's a Twitter               
keyboard type.                  

2031
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,275
It's probably got # and         
@ sign, things like that.       

2032
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:42,175
The return key,                 

2033
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,978
that's just the key on          
the things says return.         

2034
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:47,213
I'm searching here, so,         
I wanted to say search.         

2035
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:50,517
So, that means the return       
keys gonna say, I'd search.     

2036
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,753
Also, a little clear            
button would be cool,           

2037
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,455
button you can press the clear  
out what's going on.            

2038
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:58,524
So, you can kinda configure     
this in any way you want        

2039
01:24:58,593 --> 01:24:59,859
to make it work in there.       

2040
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:03,163
Now, normally I would run this  
and show you that it's there,   

2041
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:04,598
let's wire it up first, so,     
it actually does something.     

2042
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:05,966
but of course,                  

2043
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,068
It's real easy to wire up       
a text field if you just        

2044
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,070
wanna hook it up to an outlet   
and set its delegate, and       

2045
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,440
then, you can find out when     
the return key is pressed.      

2046
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:14,808
So, let's do that.              

2047
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,677
We'll go here, let's get our    
TweetTableViewController on     

2048
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:18,846
screen at the same time.        

2049
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:21,081
We just wanna create            
an outlet to that thing.        

2050
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,182
I'll put it, right in here.     

2051
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,384
So, I'm just,                   

2052
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:28,588
again, I will probably wanna    
Shift + Click to select it.     

2053
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:30,190
I, oops, picked the wrong one.  

2054
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,828
So, let's Shift + Click,        
click this, select this,        

2055
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:39,433
and Ctrl + Drag from it, and    
see it's a UITextField, and     

2056
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,969
I'm gonna call this             
my searchTextField.             

2057
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:43,904
Simple as that.                 

2058
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:49,742
When it's set, I'm going to     
set myself as its delegates.    

2059
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,814
searchTextField.delegate =      
self.                           

2060
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:58,051
Of course, for me to be         
its delegate, I have to go      

2061
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:02,422
up here and say yes,            
I am a UITextFieldDelegate.     

2062
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,225
Okay, they're all the methods   
are optional in there, so,      

2063
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:08,294
I have now successfully         
implemented that protocol.      

2064
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:11,298
Ooh, what happened here?        

2065
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:14,434
Yes, okay, so that's so         
I've set the delegate.          

2066
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:16,870
Now, I'm gonna implement        
the delegate method I want,     

2067
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:18,204
which is that should return.    

2068
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,440
It get sent to me when          
the return button is sent.      

2069
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,708
So that is textField,           

2070
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,244
notice as I type textField      
it shows me them all,           

2071
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:27,381
and it is this one right        
here textFieldShouldReturn.     

2072
01:26:27,449 --> 01:26:30,617
Let me make this bigger,        
bigger so                       

2073
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,719
you can see it better.          

2074
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,254
Okay, so here should return.    

2075
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:36,756
If I get return, I'm            
actually gonna check to make    

2076
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:39,259
sure I'm getting this           
from my searchTextField,        

2077
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:42,128
because someday I might have    
other text fields and I wanna   

2078
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,265
make sure I'm getting, I know   
which one I'm talking about.    

2079
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,066
So textField is this            
argument right here, and        

2080
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,969
I'm just checking to            
make sure it's me.              

2081
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:53,173
And if that is true then        
I'm just gonna set my           

2082
01:26:53,242 --> 01:26:58,678
searchText =                    
searchTextFields.text, okay?    

2083
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:00,480
Makes sense and                 
when I set my searchText,       

2084
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,683
that's immediately going        
to start it going.              

2085
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,919
Notice that ShouldReturn        
also returns a Bool which is    

2086
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:08,988
whether to do what it normally  
does when return is pressed.    

2087
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,189
Which in this case is nothing,  

2088
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,691
cuz we don't have               
any target action or            

2089
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,326
anything else, but              
we'll return true.              

2090
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,996
Sure do what you normally do,   
now the only other thing        

2091
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,331
here is now that we have        
the searchTextField,            

2092
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,433
up here when we set             
our searchText.                 

2093
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:23,003
We wanna update our             
searchTextField.                

2094
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:28,541
And I'll be careful here in     
case I'm doing it in prepare.   

2095
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,711
We'll set it to the searchText  
that we just set it to.         

2096
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,913
Also I'm going to have          
my searchTextField              

2097
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:37,049
resignFirstResponder here.      

2098
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:40,453
That's if somebody types        
something and hits go search,   

2099
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:42,488
and we search for               
something and put it in there.  

2100
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:43,923
I'm gonna take                  
the keyboard away.              

2101
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,658
Cuz I just don't wanna          
have the keyboard blocking      

2102
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:47,427
the results that                
they just asked for.            

2103
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:48,761
And also someone                
sets it in code.                

2104
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,397
I'm gonna get rid of keyboard.  

2105
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,798
Someone might be in             
the middle of typing but        

2106
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:53,400
if someone sets it in           
code rather than typing.        

2107
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:56,769
Let's get that keyboard         
out of the way, all right?      

2108
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:57,537
So let's go do that.            

2109
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,642
Leave this code on the screen   
so you can see it.              

2110
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:11,451
All right, so here is our text  
field, it's kinda of hard to    

2111
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,888
see under this carrier,         
we'll fix that in a second.     

2112
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,224
Let's go and search for         
#stanford again.                

2113
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:19,526
Oops, I'm not gonna do this,    
watch this.                     

2114
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:21,194
Okay that looked easy to type,  
didn't it?                      

2115
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:22,729
Well let's go here and          

2116
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:28,301
say Keyboard, turn off          
the hardware keyboard.          

2117
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,635
Now when we click in here,      

2118
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,037
ooh, it's a lot                 
harder to type.                 

2119
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:35,242
#stanford, okay so              
now you're getting into what    

2120
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,846
I'm saying about learn to       
type like your users will be.   

2121
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:42,582
So here I'm going to search,    
goes in stanford and            

2122
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:43,450
search for it.                  

2123
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:46,619
Let's go and search for         
something else here.            

2124
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:48,688
Maybe we'll search for,         

2125
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:53,159
this is kind of dangerous       
because people might say, but   

2126
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:59,198
Trump                           
>> Okay,                        

2127
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,468
there's some Trump ones.        

2128
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:04,303
Now, we've done all this.       

2129
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,672
I wanna fix this thing though,  

2130
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,207
where this looks really         
bad at the top here.            

2131
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,910
And there's this really         
easy fix to that.               

2132
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:11,845
Which is I'm just going to,     
this is the fix.                

2133
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:14,013
The fix is everything in        
the UI as you've learned.       

2134
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:17,917
I'm just gonna embed this       
in a navigation controller.     

2135
01:29:17,986 --> 01:29:22,055
Okay, when you embed this in a  
navigation controller and run,  

2136
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:25,124
you can see that it makes       
a nice title at the top,        

2137
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,059
it moves the text field down,   

2138
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:29,429
it's just much                  
nicer all around.               

2139
01:29:29,498 --> 01:29:32,164
Okay, see how it has done       
that from a bit down here.      

2140
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,867
One other thing I'm gonna do    
is put placeholder text in      

2141
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,502
there, I meant to               
show you that.                  

2142
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:40,940
Sorry, let's do that, if I      
go back to here click this.     

2143
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:44,110
That thing in here,             
swipe this guide.               

2144
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:48,648
You can put a placeholder text  
like this, Twitter Search and   

2145
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,984
see it shows it in there,       
kinda like gray.                

2146
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:54,421
So that when you run,           
it's more obvious to the user,  

2147
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:57,624
what is that big white space,   
all right?                      

2148
01:29:57,692 --> 01:30:00,093
Be clear to them that           
it's a Twitter search.          

2149
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:03,796
You know all you need to        
know to do your homework.       

2150
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:04,464
Good luck with it.              

2151
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:16,709
