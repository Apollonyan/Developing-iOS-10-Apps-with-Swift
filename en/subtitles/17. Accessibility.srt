[MUSIC]                         

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,506
Stanford University.            

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:12,410
>> Okay, welcome to Stanford    
CS193P, Winter of 2017.         

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,447
This is Developing              
iOS Applications,               

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,416
this is lecture number 17,      
I said.                         

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,119
Yes, and                        
we have a guest lecturer today  

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,056
who's gonna talk to us          
about accessibility.            

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,223
His name is Skylar Peterson.    

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,592
Why don't you come up here,     
Skylar?                         

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:29,761
It's all yours.                 

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,696
Thank you very much.            

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,297
All righty.                     

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,499
Good afternoon, everybody.      

14
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,468
As he said,                     
my name is Skylar Peterson.     

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,571
I am a member of                
Apple's Accessibility team.     

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,373
If you don't know exactly       
what I mean by that,            

17
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,174
then don't worry.               

18
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,609
It's what I'm here to           
talk to you about today.        

19
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,877
I first wanna thank Paul for    

20
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,412
inviting us here                
to speak today.                 

21
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,215
Hopefully you'll find what I    
have to say meaningful in some  

22
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,085
way, and choose to apply it to  
your own work in the future.    

23
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,054
So before we get started,       

24
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,089
let me tell you just            
a little bit about myself.      

25
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,959
I actually graduated            
from Stanford in 2014.          

26
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,195
I studied computer science,     
and                             

27
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,230
my concentration was in HCI.    

28
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,165
I took this class               
while I was here, and           

29
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,768
it's actually one of the        
reasons that I fell in love     

30
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,737
with iOS as a platform and why  
I'm in the job I'm in today,    

31
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,505
so thank you for that as well.  

32
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,209
After I graduated I spent       
a year and a half working at    

33
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,778
an enterprise software          
company called Citrix,          

34
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,514
where I worked on two           
different iOS applications.     

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,316
And then a little               
over a year ago,                

36
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,085
I made the jump to the          
Accessibility team at Apple,    

37
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,754
where I focus mainly on iOS.    

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,123
there's a couple things that    
I'd like to cover with you.     

39
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,357
So for today,                   

40
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,259
First of all,                   

41
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:37,529
what exactly do we mean         
when we say accessibility?      

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,197
And once you understand that,   

43
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,167
how do you take the tools that  
we've created for you and       

44
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,303
apply them to your own work     
to make your apps accessible?   

45
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,906
So included in that we're       
gonna take a look at            

46
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,474
the UIAccessibility API.        

47
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,844
We're gonna take a look at      
several vision accommodations   

48
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,448
that you should consider when   
designing your applications,    

49
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,184
and specifically I'm            
going to call out dynamic       

50
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,019
type as an important feature.   

51
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,189
And at the end I'd like to      
discuss some opportunities      

52
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:07,292
available to you as a           
developer in the accessibility  

53
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:07,793
space.                          

54
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,861
So let's get started.           

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,533
I'd like to begin with          
a brief video that              

56
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,737
Apple produced towards          
the end of last year.           

57
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,609
[MUSIC]                         

58
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,511
People think that having        
a disability is a barrier.      

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,950
[MUSIC].                        

60
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,186
But that's not                  
the way I see it.               

61
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,021
It.                             
[MUSIC]                         

62
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,157
You can catch up with friends.  

63
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,359
[MUSIC]                         

64
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,562
Ready?                          
You can capture a moment with   

65
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,463
your family.                    

66
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,865
One face, small face.           

67
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:47,966
Focus log.                      

68
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,602
[MUSIC]                         

69
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,304
And you can start the day       
bright and early.               

70
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:58,076
[MUSIC]                         

71
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,812
You can take a trip             
to somewhere new.               

72
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:06,585
[MUSIC]                         

73
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,286
3 miles to the summit.          

74
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,888
[MUSIC]                         

75
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,091
You can concentrate on          
every word of the story.        

76
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,560
A bird begun to sing.           

77
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,362
Jack opened his eyes.           

78
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,664
[MUSIC]                         

79
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,367
You can take                    
the long way home.              

80
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:32,310
[MUSIC]                         

81
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,811
Or edit a film.                 

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,346
[MUSIC]                         

83
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,614
Like this one.                  

84
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:43,688
[MUSIC].                        

85
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,457
When technology is              
designed for everyone,          

86
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,326
[MUSIC]                         

87
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:53,398
It lets anyone do what          
they love, including me.        

88
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,334
[MUSIC]                         

89
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,769
So the woman narrating and      

90
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,705
whom you saw featured           
throughout that video is named  

91
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,375
Sady, and                       
she has cerebral palsy.         

92
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,578
And she's the principal         
editor on that video,           

93
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,481
which I think is a powerful     
example of the way in which     

94
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,483
technology can empower          
people with disabilities and    

95
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,586
fundamentally change            
their lives.                    

96
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,955
So that is really what          
accessibility is all about.     

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,325
It's making technology          
work for everyone,              

98
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,061
making it accessible for        
everyone.                       

99
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,131
So let's take a look            
at some statistics.             

100
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,035
There are 285 million people    
worldwide who have some sort    

101
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,371
of low vision condition or      
who are entirely blind.         

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,076
There are 360 million who       
are hard of hearing or deaf.    

103
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:42,947
One in every 12 men is          
colorblind in some way, and 1   

104
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:48,119
in 68 children fall somewhere   
on the autism spectrum.         

105
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,322
And so what this means is       
that worldwide there are over   

106
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,525
a billion people that have      
a disability of some sort.      

107
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,795
Or in other words,              
one in seven.                   

108
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,864
So by no means is               
accessibility a small issue.    

109
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,733
It affects a lot of people and  

110
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,570
if your app has an audience of  
any significant size you're     

111
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,573
going to have users             
that have disabilities.         

112
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,743
And you should be doing the     
best, your best to make sure    

113
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,946
that whatever you're working    
on works for everybody.         

114
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,449
So at Apple we think of         
accessibility in four distinct  

115
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,519
groups.                         

116
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,789
which includes things like      
autism, dyslexia, and           

117
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,225
other forms of                  
learning disability.            

118
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,395
Physical and motor skills, so   
people that have tremors or     

119
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,398
Parkinson's and maybe can't     
make precise movements          

120
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,001
or gestures, but                
this also includes people who   

121
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,670
are paralyzed or have           
a limited set of digits that    

122
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,938
they can use to interact        
with the system.                

123
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,641
For instance a single           
finger or a single toe, or      

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,477
in Sadie's case, her head.      

125
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:51,049
Vision, which covers a          
spectrum of vision impairment   

126
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,885
from low vision to              
completely blind, and           

127
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,455
also includes different         
forms of color blindness.       

128
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,056
And finally we have hearing,    

129
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,160
which also like vision exists   
on a spectrum from the hard of  

130
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,096
hearing to                      
the completely deaf.            

131
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,200
So now our team has developed   
a huge set of features on iOS   

132
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,603
that assists in all of these    
categories, and best of all     

133
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,040
they all come baked into        
the system from the beginning.  

134
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,410
So they're all on all of your   
iOS devices that you can turn   

135
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,112
on, no add-ons required.        

136
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,681
And as much as I'd like to      
go feature by feature and       

137
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,684
tell you why each of these is   
cool, and why it's necessary    

138
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,454
and solves the problem,         
we don't have all night, so     

139
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,356
I'm going to focus              
on just a couple.               

140
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,759
But I do encourage you to       
go and check them out for       

141
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,561
You can find accessibility      
settings on your device by      

142
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,295
yourself.                       

143
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,631
going to General and            

144
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,501
tapping on Accessibility where  
you'll find a long list of      

145
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,071
all the features that you       
can enable on your devices.     

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,340
What I'd like to do now         
though is demo for you,         

147
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,343
one of our most popular pieces  
of assistive technology which   

148
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,444
is called VoiceOver.            

149
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,681
It's a screen reader that       
allows blind and low vision     

150
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,351
users to use a touch screen by  
audibly describing elements of  

151
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,887
the screen as they pan or       
swipe around it.                

152
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,556
So without a technology like    
this, blind users would be      

153
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,426
unable to use the iPhone which  
is why it's really important    

154
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,062
for you to take advantage of    
the API which I'm gonna get     

155
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,865
into in a little bit so that    
your apps play well with it.    

156
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,371
So, I have my device here       
on the home screen and          

157
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,106
I'm gonna turn VoiceOver on.    

158
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,543
And what you're gonna notice    
is that it's going to focus on  

159
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,445
the first element               
of the screen,                  

160
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,114
which is the Mail app in        
the upper left corner.          

161
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,349
VoiceOver on.                   

162
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,083
Mail.                           

163
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,751
No unread emails.               

164
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,520
And it described it to me, and  
told me some extra information  

165
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,123
about it, for instance,         
that I have no unread emails.   

166
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,160
So if I wanted to               
navigate between items,         

167
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,731
if I wanna go item by item,     
I can swipe right or left.      

168
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,568
Calendar, photos, camera.       

169
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,805
And it's going to read to       
me the description of each      

170
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,140
But if we're on the home        
screen which I'm here fairly    

171
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,407
item as I go.                   

172
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,077
frequently, I know my way       
around, I can also just feel    

173
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,145
my way around the screen        
with my finger.                 

174
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,415
You tapped on Music.            

175
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,952
And once I found exactly        
what I'm looking for,           

176
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,487
a double tap acts like          
a single tap would when you     

177
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,955
don't have VoiceOver on.        

178
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,023
So it's gonna open Music.       

179
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,129
Music, this is now              
playing screen, button.         

180
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,899
Now because music is            
a first party application,      

181
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,134
Apple engineers have            
gone through and                

182
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,237
made sure that all of the UI    
in that app is accessible.      

183
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,106
So VoiceOver interacts          
with this interface             

184
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,042
exactly the same way that it    
would on the home screen,       

185
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,978
I could swipe, [SOUND]          
Or                              

186
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,580
find exactly what               
I'm looking for.                

187
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,452
Now VoiceOver, because it       
is intercepting gestures        

188
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,653
that are normally used for      

189
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,956
other things when               
VoiceOver's turned off.         

190
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,925
There are analogs for           

191
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,160
each different kind of          
interaction with the system     

192
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,362
that you might need when        
VoiceOver is turned on.         

193
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,566
So, for instance, with the      
track scrubber, if I only want  

194
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,936
to scrub through the track,     
if I don't have voice over on,  

195
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,137
then I'm just gonna run         
my finger along it,             

196
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,205
like a slider.                  

197
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,742
But when VoiceOver's            
on it's trying to               

198
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,312
interpret that gesture as me    
trying to find an element.      

199
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,948
So instead we have this         
adjustable gesture on           

200
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,484
items that are adjustable,      
I can swipe my finger up and    

201
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:20,258
down to change the value.       

202
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,926
8 seconds and 3 minutes.        

203
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:22,961
30 seconds.                     

204
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,729
So those are just some very,    

205
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,565
very basic examples of          
how VoiceOver works.            

206
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,934
It's much more advanced         
than that when you get into     

207
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,469
the nitty, nitty gritty of it.  

208
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,604
And I highly encourage          
you to turn it on and           

209
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,507
play around with it and see     
what the experience is really   

210
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,042
like for a user who's blind.    

211
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,245
So where does the information   
that an assistive technology    

212
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,548
like VoiceOver                  
uses coming from?               

213
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,785
Well it runs in it's own        
process on the system, and      

214
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,854
it uses the UIAccessibility     
protocol to communicate with    

215
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,288
other processes, and            

216
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,960
ask them information about the  
current element on the screen.  

217
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,761
So VoiceOver will               
receive an input, for           

218
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,932
instance a single tap, and      

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,902
it will get the currently       
focused element's description.  

220
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,805
It will query the current       
process for predefined pieces   

221
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,106
of information                  
about that element.             

222
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,842
And from those queries,         
it's going to stitch together   

223
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,079
a user friendly                 
description and speak it.       

224
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,649
So let's take a look at         
the different properties in     

225
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,152
the protocol that an assistive  
technology is going to          

226
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,620
ask about.                      

227
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,689
The first, and                  
arguably most important,        

228
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,658
is isAccessibilityElement       
which tells VoiceOver whether   

229
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,928
or not the current thing        
should even be visible to it.   

230
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,664
And if this is set to no then   
obviously it's not going to be  

231
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,699
an accessible element and       

232
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,068
VoiceOver will not be           
able to focus on it.            

233
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,572
But in the case of say,         
a volume slider,                

234
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,006
which I'm going to              
use as an example for           

235
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,376
all these properties, we're     
gonna set this value to true.   

236
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,312
Next we have                    
the accessibilityLabel          

237
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,915
which describes                 
what an element.                

238
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,153
So in the case of the Volume    
slider, it changes the volume,  

239
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,454
so it's going to say Volume.    

240
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,524
And then you may wonder         

241
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,426
why we don't say something      
like Volume Slider.             

242
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,661
And this is because             
of this next                    

243
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,696
property accessibilityTraits    

244
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,801
which is used to define what    
category an element fits into.  

245
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,170
So in the case of a slider,     
it's an adjustable element,     

246
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,339
so we're going to give          
it the adjustable trait.        

247
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,542
This means that when            
VoiceOver describes it,         

248
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,511
it's going to say               
volume adjustable,              

249
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,280
which means that the word       
slider is redundant.            

250
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,315
And doesn't need to be there.   

251
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:26,817
Accessibility traits            

252
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,253
are important in                
other ways as well.             

253
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:33,290
So certain traits afford        
elements certain behaviors.     

254
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,060
For instance, in my demo        
where I was showing the track   

255
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,331
scrubber, that increment and    
decrement gesture is added      

256
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,134
because that view has the       
adjustable trait set to it.     

257
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,771
So, VoiceOver knows that that   
view is going to respond        

258
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,942
in some way to having its       
value increased or decreased.   

259
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,545
VoiceOver also has              
a mechanism for                 

260
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:57,982
navigating a display,           
where a user can say            

261
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,119
I want to navigate based        
on only this kind of item.      

262
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,422
So, for instance, if I had      
a table view that I wanted to   

263
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,593
navigate just by its headers    
then I could set this in        

264
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,562
VoiceOver, and it's going to    
go through and only focus on    

265
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,698
elements in the hierarchy       
that have the header trait.     

266
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,001
So it's important that all      
of your views have the right    

267
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,971
traits so they behave as        
expected to voice over users.   

268
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,442
Next we have                    
accessibility value.            

269
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,745
Which you can override if your  
view has some sort of state.    

270
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,747
So for example, the state for   

271
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,283
the volume slider is what       
is the current percent          

272
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,219
that my volume is set to,       
and we're gonna return 50%.     

273
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:39,757
And finally,                    
we have accessibilityHint.      

274
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,593
So this is another optional     
property that's meant           

275
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,129
to provide a more long-form     
description of what something   

276
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,398
is or what something does.      

277
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,035
This is important often for     
VoiceOver users who have never  

278
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,705
used your interface before and  
are trying to learn their way   

279
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,575
around it and figure out        
how things work together.       

280
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,211
But you should never            
put information that is         

281
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,381
critical to the user            
in this description             

282
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,384
because Accessibility           
can be turned off.              

283
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,619
And therefore a user            
may not ever hear them.         

284
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,756
Which they might do to          
keep VoiceOver from being       

285
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,825
too verbose if they're          
an experienced user.            

286
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,662
So those are the fine five      
main accessibility traits.      

287
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,599
Without them the interface is   
totally unusable to VoiceOver,  

288
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,036
and that's the blind and low    
vision users who rely on it.    

289
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,674
UIKit views define these        
properties by default, or       

290
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,543
most of them do, which means    
that most of the legwork is     

291
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,078
already done for you.           

292
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,612
But what you really             
need to watch out for           

293
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,551
is your own custom views,       
so let's look at some code.     

294
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,788
Let's say that I have           
a view controller               

295
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,925
that has a property image       
view of subclass MyImageView,   

296
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,695
which is a subclass             
that I've created.              

297
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,764
It's just a UIView,             
it's not a UIImageView or       

298
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,131
anything like that, so          

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,767
it doesn't have                 
accessibility by default.       

300
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,436
Well in my viewDidLoad method   
I'm obviously gonna call        

301
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,572
super and                       
then I could do this.           

302
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,342
I could use dot notation to     
set each of these different     

303
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,275
properties.                     

304
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,277
I'm gonna say yes my            

305
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,179
imageView.isAccessibilityElem-  
ent.                            

306
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:12,550
I'm gonna give it some          
reasonable label and I'm gonna  

307
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,185
give it the trait, the image    
trait, because I want it to     

308
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,322
behave like any other           
image would on the system.      

309
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,258
Now, I probably want to do      
this in a case where these      

310
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,963
values depend on                
an instance of a view.          

311
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,565
But, there may be a case where  

312
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,602
the value that is returned      
from one of these properties    

313
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,270
applies to all                  
view of that kind.              

314
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,475
So, on the subclass             
MyImageView,                    

315
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,879
I could have instead            
overridden the getter for       

316
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,182
isAccessibilityElement always   
return true.                    

317
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,451
If I know that                  
MyImageView is never not        

318
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,585
going to be an accessibility    

319
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,588
element than this is            
probably what I want to do.     

320
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,791
Or if there's some internal     
logic to that class that        

321
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,793
determines whether or           
not I should determine true or  

322
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,762
false from here, this is        
a much better way to do that.   

323
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,899
And then I can override         
the setter to just do nothing   

324
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,802
this applies to all             
of the properties.              

325
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,570
I can override them,            
their getters and               

326
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,639
setters explicitly.             

327
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,444
So, now I'd like to demo        
what you've just seen           

328
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,945
on a sample app that            
I've been working on.           

329
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:19,349
So I'm gonna go back over       
here to my device and           

330
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,618
I'm gonna turn                  
VoiceOver back on.              

331
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,353
VoiceOver on.                   

332
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,257
So you see down here I have     
this app called Notecards.      

333
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,626
[INAUDIBLE] Note note cards.    

334
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,264
It's just a basic app that has  
stacks of notecards that I      

335
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,232
can use to test myself.         

336
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,535
And I need to do                
an accessibility audit of this  

337
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,104
app to see how well it          
works with VoiceOver.           

338
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,139
So, I'm gonna start by tapping  
on the first thing I see,       

339
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,207
which is that                   
collection header.              

340
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,010
Collection.                     

341
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,814
So, as you saw it read          
the label collection but        

342
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,583
what it didn't say was header.  

343
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,952
So I have no idea               
that this thing                 

344
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,488
is actually a label that        
is meant to be a header for     

345
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,789
all of the content              
underneath it.                  

346
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,125
So that's the first thing I     
need to do is add that trait.   

347
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,294
Add button.                     

348
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,329
That button has                 
a sensible label.               

349
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,198
Physics five cards.             

350
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:07,865
That seems right.               

351
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,834
Image one button.               

352
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,702
That doesn't seem right.        

353
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,038
Image two button.               

354
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,008
And neither does that so        
both of these buttons           

355
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,243
are missing accessibility       
labels and so                   

356
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,745
I have actually no              
idea what they do.              

357
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,949
And it said image one and       
two because VoiceOver           

358
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,252
by default when it doesn't      
have a label on something that  

359
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,389
uses an image like a UIButton,  
it's going to default to that   

360
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,027
image's filename as a last      
resort to try and see if it     

361
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,829
can get something meaningful    
out of what this element is.    

362
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,533
So I need to instead add my     
own labels to those buttons.    

363
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:47,137
Trivia, nine trivia.            

364
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:47,939
Now if I go in here,            

365
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,307
I heard that that had           
the header trait.               

366
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,276
Add button.                     

367
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,076
That has a good label.          

368
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,513
Close button.                   

369
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,447
And if I come in here.          

370
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,482
The phrase "Let them            
eat cake" is commonly           

371
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,450
attributed to whom?             

372
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,551
Queen Marie Antoinette.         

373
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,119
I notice that                   
these two labels,               

374
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,388
even though VoiceOver's         
picking them up,                

375
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,124
they are picked up as separate  
elements and so, I don't        

376
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,094
really have any context for     
how they work together.         

377
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,862
One is the question and         
one is the answer.              

378
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,865
And it would actually be much   
better and give VoiceOver       

379
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,735
users much context if I were    
to group them together.         

380
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,636
That's one element and          

381
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,405
say this is the question,       
this is the answer.             

382
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,107
So they can actually            
understand what's happening in  

383
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,575
this interface.                 

384
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,845
So I'm gonna go over to         
some code, to my app.           

385
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,282
The first thing I wanna take    
care of is that header trade    

386
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,016
cuz it's pretty easy.           

387
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:36,853
And I have this title           
label right here, so            

388
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:43,628
I'm going to say accessibility  
traits or equals header.        

389
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,430
Now I'm using or equals         
instead of just explicitly      

390
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:51,101
equals, because I don't know    
what the superclass of title    

391
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,071
label, what traits              
it is added to                  

392
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,774
this accessibility element      
that it wants to have there.    

393
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,642
So I don't wanna override       
whatever it set.                

394
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,044
I just wanna add my own in.     

395
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,114
So that's what                  
I'm doing there.                

396
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,918
Next, let's look at this        
cell and the shuffle, and       

397
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,453
delete button.                  

398
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,357
So I need to add                
accessibility labels for        

399
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,893
these and come here and say     

400
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,064
shuffleButton.accessibilityLa-  
bel.                            

401
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,701
Shuffle seems like              
a reasonable label to give it.  

402
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,841
I'm gonna say delete            
button equals delete.           

403
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,845
This seems to convey to me      
what exactly these buttons      

404
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,147
are supposed to do.             

405
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,349
And finally, I'm gonna come     
to this collection view cell    

406
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,518
to have this question and       
answer.                         

407
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,752
What I'm gonna do here          

408
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,393
is override these methods or    
these properties.               

409
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,095
So I'm gonna override this      
accessibility element to        

410
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,764
always return true on           
the cell itself so              

411
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
that the entire cell has        
the accessibility element       

412
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,301
instead of each                 
individual label.               

413
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,471
I'm gonna set the label         
to return Question,             

414
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,374
then the question's text.       

415
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,543
Answer, and                     
then the answer's text.         

416
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,611
And I'm going to add            
the button trait to it because  

417
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,414
that cell is a button where I   
can go in and edit the card.    

418
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,018
And I need to convey            
that to the user.               

419
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,255
So let's build this.            

420
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,191
Notecards.                      

421
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,129
[SOUND] Notecards,              
collections heading.            

422
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,197
So I've got the header trait.   

423
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:32,836
Tab physics shuffle             
button delete button.           

424
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,638
Both buttons have               
the right labels.               

425
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,942
Trivia, link trivia, trivia     
question: the phrase "Let them  

426
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,945
eat cake" is commonly           
attributed to whom?             

427
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,448
Answer Queen Marie Antoinette.  

428
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,417
So, I've got it behaving        
exactly as I want it,           

429
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,220
just a few simple               
lines of code.                  

430
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,023
That's just a couple examples   
of some of the issues that you  

431
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,325
might find in your own apps.    

432
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,129
So I'm gonna go back,           
to my account.                  

433
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:06,069
I also would like to            
touch on- VoiceOver off.        

434
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,906
The idea of containers.         

435
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,042
So aside from the attributes.   

436
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,113
We also have the accessibility  
container protocol.             

437
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,648
So let's say that I am          
the engineer who has been       

438
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,150
tasked with coding this         
view in the Calendar app,       

439
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,618
it's the year view.             

440
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,156
And I've decided that I am      
going to design this view so    

441
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,093
that each week is its           
own custom UIView.              

442
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,561
And within that UIView's        
drawRect method,                

443
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,232
I'm going to explicitly draw    
all the days of the week.       

444
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,035
Now because those views that    
I've drawn aren't standard      

445
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,337
UIKit views,                    

446
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,106
they don't inherit              
accessibility by default.       

447
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:46,043
And I don't really have         
an easy way of setting          

448
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,246
the accessibility               
properties on each of them.     

449
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:50,948
But what we'd like for          

450
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,984
them to be is visible to        
VoiceOver one day at a time.    

451
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,920
And so that I can navigate      
them day by day and             

452
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,656
get a description for           
each day at a time,             

453
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,458
rather than each                
week at a time.                 

454
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,795
So I need to do is create a     
set of accessibility elements   

455
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,364
from scratch that overlay       
these day views and             

456
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,700
return them as sub-elements     
of my accessibility, or         

457
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,503
of my week view container.      

458
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,573
So what does that               
look like in code?              

459
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,710
Well, I have this               
MyWeekView class.               

460
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,913
Which I'm going to explicitly   
say is not an accessibility     

461
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,150
element, because I instead      
want VoiceOver to go through    

462
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,320
and find the sub-elements       
of it that are accessible.      

463
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,625
And I'm going to create         
an array of elements that       

464
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,661
are UIAccessibilityElement.     

465
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,797
I'm going to iterate over       
the days of the week that       

466
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,432
are in that week.               

467
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,401
And for each one I'm going      
to create an accessibility      

468
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,537
element, with the               
accessibility container set     

469
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,207
as myself, because I'm          
the one that contains it.       

470
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,776
I'm going to set its            
label to be something           

471
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,677
sensible for that day.          

472
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,913
And now I'm going to            
set this property               

473
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,648
accessibilityFrameInContainer-  
Space.                          

474
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,618
Now, this is crucial because    
it indicates to VoiceOver       

475
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,721
where the element is on         
the screen, so that when I'm    

476
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,760
panning around with my finger   
VoiceOver knows where it is.    

477
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,863
So if my finger is over it,     
it can describe it to me and    

478
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,965
see that I'm trying to          
focus on that element.          

479
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,368
It's also what VoiceOver uses   
to draw the bounding box.       

480
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,073
And in case you couldn't        
tell this frame should be in    

481
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,809
the coordinate space            
of its container.               

482
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,681
So once I do that, I'll pan     
the element to my array of      

483
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,650
accessibility elements, and     
then, I will set the property   

484
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,488
on MyWeekView accessibility     
elements to be those elements.  

485
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,325
And what this says is these     
are all my accessible           

486
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:45,228
sub-elements and                
VoiceOver should navigate them  

487
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,065
in the order that I returned    
them in this array.             

488
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,202
So, let's take a look at        
adding that to my sample app.   

489
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,106
Let me go back over here.       

490
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,008
And turn the VoiceOver          
back on.                        

491
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:02,479
VoiceOver on now.               

492
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,814
So you may have wondered        

493
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,582
what this shuffle               
button actually does.           

494
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,286
Well, it shuffles the cards in  
the deck and puts them up so    

495
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:09,886
I can test them.                

496
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,257
Shuffle trivia heading.         

497
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,426
And what I have down here,      

498
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,163
this little circle view         
is just a little UI to          

499
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,099
indicate to me how far          
I am through the deck.          

500
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,369
So if I go to the next card     
for instance- Next question.    

501
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,205
It's increasing because         
I'm filling out the circle      

502
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,974
with how many cards I've done.  

503
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,909
However if I stay               
to swipe to it.                 

504
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,544
Next question,                  
from next question.             

505
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,013
I hear a bonk and               

506
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,083
try to run my finger I'm        
also hearing a bonk.            

507
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,186
So what that indicates is       
that when I swiped and          

508
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,590
did it it means there's         
nothing left on the screen for  

509
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,093
VoiceOver to swipe to you've    
hit the last element.           

510
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,961
And when I'm running my finger  
over it means that there's      

511
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,797
nothing below my finger that    
is an accessible element.       

512
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,900
But we'd really like that to    
be accessible to VoiceOver      

513
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,837
users, so they can track their  
progress through this stack.    

514
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,004
And so we're gonna use          

515
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:05,109
accessibility elements          
to accomplish this.             

516
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:07,911
So I'm gonna come               
back over to my code.           

517
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,913
I'm gonna go to this            
ShuffleStatusView,              

518
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,616
which is where I've done        
the drawing of this circle.     

519
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,954
I'm gonna copy and paste.       

520
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,528
So, what I've done              
here is I've created            

521
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,731
an AccessibilityElement with    
myself as the container.        

522
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,901
I set its label to be card,     
whatever the current card       

523
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,937
number is,                      
of the total amount of cards.   

524
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,072
I've set its                    
accessibilityFrame              

525
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,875
to be the frame of the circle.  

526
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,411
And in my                       
AccessibilityElements because   

527
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,412
the previous and                

528
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,114
next button are also            
part of the StatusView,         

529
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,083
I don't want them to be         
left out from VoiceOver.        

530
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,885
So I'm gonna also               
include those in my             

531
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,621
AccessibilityElements along     
with the new element that       

532
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,656
I've just created.              

533
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,425
So let's see if that worked.    

534
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,329
NoteCards, NoteCards, collect,  

535
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:03,100
shuffle button, shuffle,        
trivia, previous question.      

536
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,368
I've got my previous button.    

537
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:12,175
Next question, problem,         
part one of nine.               

538
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,211
So now it's become accessible.  

539
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,048
And pretty easy,                
not too many lines of code.     

540
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,383
We can go back.                 

541
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,321
So I'd like to change           
gears for a minute, and         

542
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,792
talk a little bit about some    
visual accommodations that you  

543
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,594
should be aware of when         
you're designing your app.      

544
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,364
So the first thing is color.    

545
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,701
Color is a useful means of      
differentiating information,    

546
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,537
but if it's the sole            
differentiator                  

547
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,139
then users who are colorblind   
won't be able to fully          

548
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,974
understand the user interface.  

549
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,644
So, take for                    
example this view in Mail.      

550
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,714
Our designers wanted            
the unread and                  

551
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,184
flagged messages to be          
differentiated apart from each  

552
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:58,288
other with circle views that    
are of a particular color.      

553
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,691
But to a colorblind user, they  
can't tell the difference.      

554
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,695
So what we did, is we added     
a setting in Mail so that you   

555
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:10,533
can change flag messages        
to use shape and color.         

556
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,204
And what this does is it uses   
both color and shape to convey  

557
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,906
meaning so that no user         
has to be left out.             

558
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,576
So, if you're writing           
an app that uses color to       

559
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,343
convey meaning,                 

560
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,046
then you should consider        
doing something similar.        

561
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,850
Now color can also be too       
bright, distracting, and        

562
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,585
contrast and transparency and   

563
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,222
blurring can all have negative  
impacts on legibility for       

564
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,891
people that have certain        
vision conditions.              

565
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,427
This is the default             
control center on iOS and       

566
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,330
as you can see color bleeds     
through from behind and         

567
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,233
is blurred by the control       
center's background.            

568
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,402
But if I turn on                
the darken colors and           

569
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,370
reduce transparency setting,    

570
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,941
we no longer get those colors   
bleeding through from behind.   

571
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,777
And the contrast                
between the colors and          

572
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,846
the lighter background          
is much more stark,             

573
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,482
which means that it's a lot     
more readable to those users    

574
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,850
that have those                 
vision conditions.              

575
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,854
So you can check whether        
things like these are enabled   

576
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,523
through these two               
UIKit functions.                

577
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,693
And this way, you can adapt     
your interface to the needs     

578
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,496
of your users rather than       
having to try and create        

579
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,066
some design that, from the get  
go, applies to everybody.       

580
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,071
Now for this next one, I'm      
going to say that anybody in    

581
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,840
the room who gets motion sick   
from phone animation should     

582
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,042
probably look away for          
a second.                       

583
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,911
Device is gonna                 
show these standard             

584
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,047
app opening animation.          

585
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,282
So you can see that             
when I tap on music,            

586
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,884
the app expands from its        
place on the dock, and          

587
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,154
the screen swoops               
in to center on it.             

588
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,623
But if I turn on                
the reduce motion setting,      

589
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,193
I instead get this cross fade.  

590
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,864
So there are certain people     
with vestibular disorders       

591
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,934
that can be triggered by        
complex motion which most       

592
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,271
often results in things         
like nausea and dizziness.      

593
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,407
So you should be mindful of     
any animations in your app,     

594
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,544
particularly if they cause      
a lot of movement or            

595
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,113
are unexpected in some way.     

596
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,715
You should consider             
enabling an alternative         

597
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,852
animation when this setting is  
enabled which you can check     

598
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,953
through a similar               
UIKit function.                 

599
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,391
Now the final visual            
accommodation that I'd like     

600
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,594
to talk about today             
relates to typography, and      

601
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,430
it's dynamic type which is      
a feature in iOS that allows    

602
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,299
a user to scale their font.     

603
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,535
And I believe you touched       
on it very briefly.             

604
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,339
There are many users out there  
who struggle to use devices     

605
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,442
because the type is so small,   
or so thin that it ends up      

606
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,111
blurring together, and          
they can't read it.             

607
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,582
And this applies to people      
with low vision conditions,     

608
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:41,718
but it also applies to people   
whose vision is simply          

609
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,420
deteriorated from age, or       

610
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,223
people who simply               
need to wear glasses.           

611
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,925
So, Dynamic Type is meant       
to help adapt these             

612
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,327
people's devices                
to their needs.                 

613
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,865
Now on the left you see the     
standard Mail inbox interface   

614
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,599
with the default text.          

615
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,968
And on the right I've scaled    
it up several levels.           

616
00:28:59,037 --> 00:28:59,836
And as you can see,             

617
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,372
the interface has adapted       
itself and the layout as well   

618
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,341
to accommodate                  
the larger text size.           

619
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,811
The most common way that        
you're gonna get this behavior  

620
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,882
is by using this method         
preferredFont(forTextStyle.     

621
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,751
which is a class                
method on UIFont.               

622
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,220
When you set the font           
of a UILabel or                 

623
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,958
UITextView, using this method,  
the font will be scaled to      

624
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,060
the user's preference           
using the system font.          

625
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,730
And what you do is you pass     
through a TextStyle, which      

626
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,565
indicates what the general      
purpose of the text is.         

627
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,036
So titles are large and         
body is a more standard size.   

628
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,073
There are these eight distinct  
styles that you can pass this   

629
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,009
method and each of them have    
pre-defined point sizes and     

630
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,310
weight sizes to them.           

631
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,215
So, let's look at some          
code where I used that.         

632
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,118
So let's say I have             
MyLabelView which is            

633
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,987
a custom UIView, and            
it has a sub label or           

634
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,556
a sub view that is              
of class UILabel.               

635
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,293
Now in my init method,          
I'm going to init that label.   

636
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,828
Now, I'm gonna set its          
number of lines to be 0.        

637
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,232
And what this indicates to the  
UILabel, is that it doesn't     

638
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,201
need to be limited to any       
specific number of lines.       

639
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,570
It can actually grow to         
an unbounded number of lines.   

640
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,440
Which is important when I'm     
growing the text size because   

641
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,376
as I get bigger and bigger,     
it's likelier, it's more and    

642
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,012
more likely that I'm not        
gonna be able to fit whatever   

643
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,581
text I have on a single line.   

644
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,720
Now I also need to set          
adjustsFontForContentSizeCate-  

645
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,524
gory to be true, and what this  
does is it tells the label      

646
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,927
that when the user has          
changed their font size and     

647
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:35,565
my app is opened in the         
background, I need to update.   

648
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,569
The label needs to update       
itself to match whatever        

649
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,872
the new font that I've          
changed my size to is.          

650
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,009
And then I am going to          
use that preferredFont          

651
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:46,843
forTextStyle.                   

652
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,744
Probably just gonna use body,   

653
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,482
because it's standard in this   
case and then add my subview.   

654
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,485
Now, what do you do in          
the case where you wanna use    

655
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,355
a custom point size when        
you're at the default           

656
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,156
text size?                      

657
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,457
Or you even wanna use           
a custom font but               

658
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,926
you still wanna                 
support dynamic type.           

659
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,762
I did this in my                
own sample app,                 

660
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,097
it uses the                     
boldSystemFontOfSize method,    

661
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,600
which is not going to           
automatically be scaled to      

662
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,135
the user's preference.          

663
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,973
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm    
going to take advantage of      

664
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:21,879
this property on UIApplication  
preferredContestSizeCategory.   

665
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,113
And what this tells me,         

666
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,450
is what the user has            
currently set their font to.    

667
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:35,124
Now there are seven distinct    
size categories at default.     

668
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,661
The large size is               
the default size on iOS.        

669
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:42,899
But there are also five more    
accessibility sizes and         

670
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:46,536
located in accessibility        
settings that can make          

671
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,872
the text really, really big.    

672
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,409
So what would my code for       
something like this look like?  

673
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:56,045
Well, I'd probably create       
some sort of NSObject like      

674
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,248
MyFontManager, that will be     
an object that will manage all  

675
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,219
the fonts for my app so that I  
can run everything through it.  

676
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,289
And then I'd have some          
method like this,               

677
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:10,927
where I'd use a fontSize        
variable and write a switch     

678
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,197
statement that changes the      
value of the fontSize based     

679
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,734
on what my sizeCategory is set  
to, to some sensible value.     

680
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,303
I mean to do that for           
every case.                     

681
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,605
And then I'm gonna use          
whatever the method             

682
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,375
I was going to use before,      
like systemFont(ofSize: or      

683
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,445
my custom font or               
boldSystemFont(ofSize:          

684
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,281
using whatever size I           
determined was appropriate for  

685
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,482
the current size class.         

686
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:39,556
Now it's also important that I  
register myself to listen for   

687
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,125
the                             
UIContentSizeCategoryDidChange  

688
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:42,992
notification.                   

689
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,428
Because I'm no longer using     
that preferred font for         

690
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,831
text style method so all my     
views aren't gonna know that    

691
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,968
they need to update themselves  
when the font size changes.     

692
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,372
So I'm gonna register myself    
as an observer on this          

693
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,408
notification and just write     
a method that updates           

694
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,078
my fonts in some sort           
of sensible way.                

695
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,749
So let's move for               
the final time to my demo app,  

696
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,185
and see what it's like          
with dynamic type.              

697
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,090
Now for this, I'm actually      
gonna exit full screen.         

698
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:21,698
And I'm going to bring up       
this tool in Xcode called       

699
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,668
the Accessibility Inspector.    

700
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,870
Now this is a super useful      
tool that I don't really have   

701
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,040
time to go in to today          
about how you can use it.       

702
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,477
But, it's an app that's built   
into Xcode that allows you to   

703
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,213
audit your own application for  

704
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,314
all of its                      
accessibility problems.         

705
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,284
And there's a great video from  
last year's WWDC that you can   

706
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,787
find on the developer           
website to go through exactly   

707
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,887
how you used this app,          

708
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,558
which I will have a link to at  
the end of the presentation.    

709
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,427
But for now, I'm going to       
attach to my phone and          

710
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,531
simply use it to change         
the font size dynamically so    

711
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,867
that you can see what happens   
on the screen, what I do.       

712
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,704
So I'm gonna come to            
my stack of cards, and          

713
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:04,374
I can see that the number of    

714
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:08,144
lines is already set to zero    
because this label is growing   

715
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,380
based on how much text I        
have there as I want it to.     

716
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,748
But we're gonna see,            

717
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,518
is as I change this value       
here with the slider,           

718
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,622
my text isn't updating at all,  
the content size.               

719
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,723
So something is wrong.          

720
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,194
So I'm gonna come over          
here to MyFontManager.          

721
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,832
And I'm gonna go look at        
my appFont method and           

722
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,468
I see the problem immediately.  

723
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,504
I'm not adapting myself to      
what the preferred contentSize  

724
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,673
is and I'm not using            
the preferred font for          

725
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,841
text style method.              

726
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:51,420
So I'm gonna replace that,      
With this,                      

727
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,456
which takes this size and,      

728
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:57,827
based on some multiplier        
that I decided looks good.      

729
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,696
I'm going to modify             
what the font size is,          

730
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,632
based on the SizeCategory.      

731
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,534
And I'm going to                
return that using my            

732
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,135
boldSystemFont(ofSize:.         

733
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,204
Now, like I said,               

734
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,940
I also need to register for     
that notification, so           

735
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,775
that my view actually           
updates itself in real time.    

736
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,177
So we're gonna                  
go to that cell.                

737
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,849
And I'm going to add            
myself as an observer,          

738
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,785
not to put that there.          

739
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,325
And in my                       
contentSizeCategoryChange       

740
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,129
method, I'm just going to       
update the fonts here.          

741
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,136
And that should work,           
hopefully, so let's rebuild.    

742
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,405
So I'm gonna come               
back over here.                 

743
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,808
I'm gonna open this and         

744
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,545
I'm gonna bring up my           
Accessibility Inspector again.  

745
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,849
And now as I change the size    
you see that it's growing       

746
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:57,486
bigger, and bigger,             
until it's real, real big.      

747
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,223
And everything works exactly    
as I was expecting it to.       

748
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,759
And, not a huge change.         

749
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:07,630
So, I've covered several        
ways that you as a develop,     

750
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:11,901
developer can make your app     
more accessible to people.      

751
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,937
This can actually be a great    
way to get your app featured    

752
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,872
on the store.                   

753
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,608
So we have sections that        
are devoted specifically to     

754
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,409
general purpose applications.   

755
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,344
That we think we've done        

756
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,212
a good job with                 
their accessibility.            

757
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,715
For instance,                   
this collection of apps that    

758
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,117
are good to use                 
with VoiceOver.                 

759
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,554
Beyond making your              
own app accessible,             

760
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,691
there's also a whole set        
of apps that are aimed at       

761
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,628
accessible users specifically.  

762
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,665
So, I'd like to run through     
a few of those examples with    

763
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,299
you today.                      

764
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,237
We have knfbReader,             
which is an app that scans      

765
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,507
text in real time, and let's    
users who are low vision or     

766
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:52,975
blind interact with             
things like paper or            

767
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,811
a restaurant menu,              
so they can read it.            

768
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:59,783
We have an app like Ava, which  
transcribes conversations in    

769
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,686
real time, so that a user       
who's hard of hearing or        

770
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,454
even deaf, can follow           
a conversation easier.          

771
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,024
And this includes a feature     
that actually breaks            

772
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,860
conversation down,              
differentiating the different   

773
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,530
speakers by color so            
I can tell who is speaking.     

774
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,034
And finally we have this app,   
Children with Autism,           

775
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,537
which is a visual scheduler     
built specifically for          

776
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,471
children with autism.           

777
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,374
And allows them to be           
more independent and            

778
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,676
understand what                 
they need to do,                

779
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,548
during their day as they        
are going along, task by task.  

780
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,283
So these are just               
a couple of examples.           

781
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,686
And you may wonder, why am      
I telling you about this?       

782
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:42,425
Well, basically, if you're      
looking for a possible idea     

783
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,994
for a class of what you         
might want to work on.          

784
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,231
Or the next great thing that    
you think you wanna work on,    

785
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,534
I encourage you to check out    
some of the work that's being   

786
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,837
done in accessibility because   
there are a lot of problems     

787
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:58,575
that still aren't solved, and   
that are worthwhile to tackle.  

788
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,476
Now, I've covered               
a lot today and                 

789
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,379
there's more that you           
can find on the web.            

790
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,682
These are a couple of links to  
some resources that you might   

791
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,318
find useful, including some of  
the things that I spoke about   

792
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,720
during the presentation today.  

793
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,324
I would encourage you to check  
out some of these WWDC videos,  

794
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,259
In particular,                  

795
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,628
including the one on            
inclusive app design,           

796
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,531
which is a whole session        
on design, focused on           

797
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,734
both accessibility as well      
as internationalization.        

798
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,869
And that auditing your          
apps for accessibility,         

799
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,572
which goes through how to take  
advantage of the accessibility  

800
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,708
inspector to make your          
own apps accessible.            

801
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,645
So, in closing,                 

802
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,081
I'd like to circle back         
to the why of it all.           

803
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,885
Why should you take the time    
to do something like this?      

804
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:46,055
Let me read you this quote      
from Sady, the woman who,       

805
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,492
from the video that I           
showed at the beginning.        

806
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,428
My love for technology is       
more than just a passion.       

807
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,831
It gives me access              
to my world.                    

808
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,634
I need help in some areas,      
but assistive technology        

809
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,069
enables me to communicate       
with my loved ones, and         

810
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,771
pursue my career.               

811
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,572
What everybody else can         
do with a keyboard and          

812
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,009
a mouse,                        
I can do with my two switches.  

813
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,981
The common person's life        
is enhanced by technology.      

814
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,318
But for somebody like Sady,     
technology is transformative.   

815
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,455
It can make them independent    
in ways that really couldn't    

816
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,024
have been imagined              
ten years ago.                  

817
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,894
It can allow them to do jobs    
that they couldn't have done,   

818
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,163
have hobbies that they          
couldn't have had, or           

819
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,866
experience the world in ways    
that they couldn't have.        

820
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,303
So by taking the time and       
putting in the effort to make   

821
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,039
sure that the work you do       
works for everyone, you can     

822
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,110
have a lasting, meaningful      
impact on people's lives.       

823
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,546
I promise you that you'll       
never find a more loyal         

824
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,783
customer than the one whose     
life you made better.           

825
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,485
Now I know that some of you     
may be thinking that that's     

826
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,686
great and all, but              
there are some things that      

827
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,956
really just don't work          
with accessibility.             

828
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,692
And I challenge you             
to think different.             

829
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,095
If you'd asked somebody 15      
years ago how a blind person    

830
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:00,930
could use a touch screen,       

831
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,465
they probably would have        
told you that they couldn't.    

832
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,534
And that's not true today.      

833
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,906
Anything is really possible     
when you put your mind to it.   

834
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:13,476
So this is a video of my        
colleague Ryan DJing at last    

835
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,610
year's WWDC.                    

836
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,412
Where we awarded                
the app djay Pro for            

837
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,148
their work on accessibility.    

838
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:22,018
He DJed live on stage using     
the app with VoiceOver and      

839
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,386
I'd like to play this           
brief clip for you now.         

840
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,789
I have an iPad Pro              
running djay Pro and            

841
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,324
this external mixer.            

842
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,494
I'm gonna go ahead and          
throw on my headphones now.     

843
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,598
So, here's the things that's    
interesting, the external DJ    

844
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:39,001
controller acts as an           
extension of the onscreen UI.   

845
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,104
And so I can use it to really   
create kind of a pretty         

846
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,505
cool performance.               

847
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,575
Also you're probably wondering  
what of this can I see.         

848
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,743
Not much.                       

849
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,112
I pretty can see the light      
coming from the screen and      

850
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,848
some of the colorful lights     
coming from the DJ controller,  

851
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,417
but that's about it.            

852
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,518
So knowing that,                

853
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,154
we're gonna use VoiceOver       
to control this interface.      

854
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,455
Let's go ahead and              
get the music started.          

855
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:05,862
Play Okay, so the first thing   
I'd like to point out is that   

856
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,598
I have access to information    
I've never had before.          

857
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,132
For example, the time.          

858
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,501
How much time is                
left on this track?             

859
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,134
Let's find out.                 

860
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,804
Time deck one, 2:56.            

861
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:15,471
That's perfect.                 

862
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,539
Okay, so I'm the DJ.            

863
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,873
I'm supposed to keep            
the music going, and            

864
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,642
now I have that kind            
of information.                 

865
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,710
I also can use these            
tempo sliders.                  

866
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,948
For example if I touch it       
right now, hold on a second.    

867
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,817
tempo deck one 0% adjustable.   

868
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,819
So we hear it's at its          
standard playback speed, but    

869
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:34,623
if I slow it down using         
the DJ controller and           

870
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,391
I touch it again.               

871
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,227
Tempo deck one,                 
-7.1%, adjustable.              

872
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,996
We can hear exactly how far     
I've slown that track down,     

873
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,131
that's really cool.             

874
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,633
I also can use these            
multi-dimensional effect pads   

875
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,570
for example if I touch it       
the first time Effects pad,     

876
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,404
deck one.                       

877
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:54,576
But the second time.            

878
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,744
Really cool stuff, right.       

879
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,448
So between these effects pads,  
this external controller, and   

880
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,916
all this accessible UI.         

881
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,385
I can do a pretty               
cool performance.               

882
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,187
So I'd like to go ahead and     
ask the stage crew to please    

883
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,189
take VoiceOver off              
of the PA systems.              

884
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,892
So that it's only available     
to me in my headphones.         

885
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,293
Play deck one.                  

886
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,294
Cool, thank you very much.      

887
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,996
And I'm gonna mix for you now.  

888
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:14,496
Here we go.                     

889
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:24,607
[MUSIC]                         

890
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:44,960
[APPLAUSE]                      
So because of the effort        

891
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,030
that their team put in, people  
with vision impairments,        

892
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,900
like Ryan, can DJ just          
as well as anybody else.        

893
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,602
It's something that he loves    
to do, and it's only possible   

894
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,339
because somebody at that        
company decided that it was     

895
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,943
worth it.                       

896
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,143
Thank you.                      

897
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:04,413
[APPLAUSE]
