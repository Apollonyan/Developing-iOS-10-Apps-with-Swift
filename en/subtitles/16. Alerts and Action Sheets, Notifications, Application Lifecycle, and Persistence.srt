00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,439
Stanford University.            

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:11,676
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P,  
Developing Applications for     

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,378
iOS, Winter 2017.               

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,280
This is lecture number 16.      

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,883
We have some miscellaneous      
topics today, all of which I    

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:23,221
think might be interesting to   
you for your final projects.    

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,390
We're gonna talk                
about alerts and                

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,226
alert's cousin: action sheet.   

10
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,095
We'll talk about                
notifications,                  

11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,497
that's the radio station        
model from our MVC.             

12
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,399
We'll talk about                
the application lifecycle: we   

13
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,101
already talked about            
the lifecycle of view,          

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,103
but now we're gonna talk        
about the lifecycle of          

15
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,204
the whole application.          

16
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,373
And finally I'm gonna           
talk about persistence.         

17
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,674
How do we store stuff so        

18
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,976
that when our app               
launches it finds it and        

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,113
of course you already know      
a couple ways of doing that.    

20
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,883
So I'm just gonna show          
you a couple others.            

21
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,687
Let's start with this alerts    
and action sheets business.     

22
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,188
These are "pop up and           

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,125
ask the user a question"        
kind of user interfaces.        

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,963
They're both just MVCs,         
alert and action sheet is just  

25
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,533
an MVC, and they're always      
presented modally or in         

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,771
a popover, which as we learned  
last time is basically modal.   

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,974
So alerts pop up in             
the middle of the screen,       

28
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:20,345
they usually ask questions      
with only two answers.          

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,614
Like yes or no, OK and Cancel.  

30
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,352
It is okay to have an alert I   
guess with just an OK button.   

31
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,890
Usually you wanna maybe think   
of if there's a better way to   

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,727
present that information        
to the user than putting up     

33
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,313
And then we start talking       
about having three answers      

34
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,831
an alert.                       

35
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,231
in alert.                       

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,267
(A) you might wanna think       
about an action sheet,          

37
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,869
which I'll talk                 
about in a second.              

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,604
And (B) you just might wanna    
think about how am I getting    

39
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,374
the user in the situation       
where I'm asking them           

40
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,708
an emergency question,          

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,844
and there's three               
different answers or            

42
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,347
even more than three, that      
would really be interesting.    

43
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,550
So, alerts are quite            
disruptive to the UI.           

44
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,119
The user is happily using       
their user interface and        

45
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,955
then bam, the whole screen      
goes grey and there's this      

46
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,693
little box in the middle and    
it's giving them some alert.    

47
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,595
I saw a class forum post about  
using alert, and there was      

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,398
a great suggestion there from   
one of the TAs which is,        

49
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,467
this is something you wanna     
read the Apple human interface  

50
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,137
guidelines about using alerts,  
when to use them,               

51
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,306
what to say in alert,           
things like that.               

52
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,309
And in fact, I recommend        
all of you read the human       

53
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,912
interface guidelines            
from Apple in general, so       

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,281
I'm gonna post that on the      
class forum, the link to that.  

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,484
And I'm actually going          
to hold you to it in            

56
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,954
the UI part of the rubric       
in your final project.          

57
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,157
So pay some close attention     
to that, Apple's done           

58
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,694
a really good job of analyzing  
all the uses of the various UI  

59
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,164
elements and kind of what       
works well, what doesn't work   

60
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,568
so well, and what's consistent  
between different things so.    

61
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,773
An alert can ask the user for   
a little bit of text.           

62
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,675
This has been abused to         

63
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,613
make like login screens out of  
alerts and things like that.    

64
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,382
It's pretty rare in my          
experience that you actually    

65
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,951
wanna ask for text in           
an alert, but I'll show you in  

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,989
the demo today how to do it,    
but it's pretty unusual.        

67
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,792
And then there's                
action sheets,                  

68
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,895
now an action sheet does not    
gray out the whole screen and   

69
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:17,796
appear in a little box,         

70
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,466
instead on an iPhone it         
slides up from the bottom.      

71
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,303
And on an iPad,                 
it's always gonna pop over.     

72
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,174
Now, an action sheet,           
I like to think of as           

73
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,477
a branching decision            
user interface element.         

74
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,781
So a user has gotten to some    
point in the UI where you       

75
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,883
simply can't really             
proceed without knowing         

76
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,619
what the user wants to do.      

77
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,323
So for an example: maybe you    
want to include an image in     

78
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,524
something.                      

79
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,593
A contact, and                  
it's the profile image, or      

80
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,195
something like that.            

81
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,630
And do you want that image      
to come from the camera,        

82
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,200
where it's gonna take           
a picture right now?            

83
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,002
Or from the photo library,      
past photos you've taken?       

84
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,773
Or maybe from some collection   
view of clip art or something,  

85
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,076
avatars or whatever that you    
provide, so you've kind of got  

86
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,146
to go in one of these three     
directions so an active sheet   

87
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,549
might slide up from the bottom  
and say you know add photo,     

88
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,386
how do you wanna do it and      
you get these choices.          

89
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,323
And usually there's Cancel      
also which is I didn't mean to  

90
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,857
do that so cancel.              

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,795
Action usually have             
more then two answers.          

92
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,198
It wouldn't be wrong            
necessarily to have an action   

93
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,167
sheet with only                 
two answers but                 

94
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,404
it just rarely does that        
circumstance arise.             

95
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,440
So what do these two            
things look like?               

96
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,909
This is what an action sheet    
looks like on an iPhone.        

97
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,012
You see how it slides up from   
the bottom there and it has     

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,482
some choices in it and this     
is what an alert looks like.    

99
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,151
It takes over                   
the whole screen.               

100
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,987
This one happens to have        
a little text field in it,      

101
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,222
with two choices there.         

102
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,524
So let's talk about the API.    

103
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,893
To make these work because      
it's the exact same API,        

104
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,829
in fact it's the same MBC       
that does both of them.         

105
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,567
This is the API to create       
this view controller,           

106
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,669
it's called a UI                
alert controller, and           

107
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,705
it just has a title, which      
is that thing at the top,       

108
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,940
you see where it says           
redeploy Cassini.               

109
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,509
In the picture on the left      
there, that's the title.        

110
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,545
And then message is just        
a short informational message   

111
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,081
telling you what the heck       
is going on right now.          

112
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,084
And then preferred              
style right there,              

113
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,354
if you set that to action       
sheet you get an action sheet.  

114
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,622
If you set it to .alert you're  
going to get an alert and       

115
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,523
I'll show you that.             

116
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,894
So the API for these is         
basically identical except for  

117
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,997
this one little preferred       
style thing right there.        

118
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,733
So once you've created your     
alert, you wanna add buttons.   

119
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,103
Now adding buttons to your      
alert or action sheet,          

120
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,805
is done with add action.        

121
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:45,677
And the argument to add action  
is a UI alert action object.    

122
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,580
And UIAlertAction is            
created with a title.           

123
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,149
So that's the title             
of the button.                  

124
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,752
A style, and we'll talk         
about what all the styles,      

125
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,952
the button styles are.          

126
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,020
And then a handler.             

127
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,890
Now, this handler is just       
a closure that you provide.     

128
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,592
This is the handler that's      
gonna get executed if that      

129
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,162
button is pressed, so           
that's the model for            

130
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,864
alerts, it couldn't             
be simpler.                     

131
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,933
So let's look in example one,   
we got Orbit Saturn right       

132
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,102
there, see the title            
is Orbit Saturn.                

133
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,773
The style,                      
this style is called .default.  

134
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,376
So the default style, the text  
is gonna not be red, okay,      

135
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,646
it's gonna be whatever color    
you've got going on in          

136
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,648
your app there, usually blue.   

137
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,684
And then in my closure here,    
this orbits Saturn, so          

138
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,287
I'm gonna just go into          
orbit around Saturn.            

139
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,556
That's Cassini's mission by     
the way, to go to orbit around  

140
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,160
Saturn, so it's just going to   
do it, if I click that button.  

141
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,096
And let's add another button,   

142
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,132
this one's explore Titan,       
a moon out there.               

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,101
This is a little bit outside,   
well it's inside Cassini's      

144
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,804
mission but                     
before we divert it,            

145
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,373
we wanna make sure we're        
gonna log in for example.       

146
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,509
So here in my closure           
you see I've logged in,         

147
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,244
made sure I'm logged in         
before I go to type.            

148
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,212
But it's the same               
kind of thing,                  

149
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,615
a default button right there.   

150
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,149
All right, so we've got         
those two default buttons,      

151
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,183
the blue ones.                  

152
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,854
How about that closeup          
of sun button.                  

153
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,190
Now if Cassini closed           
up to the sun,                  

154
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,259
it will be destroyed cuz        
it doesn't have enough          

155
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,529
propulsion to escape            
the sun gravity well there.     

156
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,132
So I made the style of this     
button be .destructive,         

157
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,801
instead of .default.            

158
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,004
And so .destructive in an       
action sheet is gonna turn in   

159
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,540
turn up red okay just so        
that the user knows "           

160
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,977
this one is probably something  
I should be carefully with".    

161
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,446
And anytime you have            
a destructive action in your    

162
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,382
closure, you are probably       
going to want to confirm that   

163
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,918
this really want do to          
that destructive action.        

164
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,188
In this case, for example I'm   
gonna make them log in again    

165
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,722
or something like that.         

166
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,157
So that's destructive, and      

167
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,893
then finally we've got the      
cancel button at the bottom,    

168
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,530
that's another type of button   
called Cancel style and         

169
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,999
you can see that it looks       
a little different right,       

170
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,435
it's kinda separated            
from the other buttons.         

171
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,604
It's not destructive in         
fact it's the opposite of       

172
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,007
destructive, it gets            
you out of the problem.         

173
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:56,974
Of this action sheet,           

174
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,609
to go back to wherever          
you were before,                

175
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,079
you're not really gonna         
redeploy Cassini.               

176
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,014
And, but                        
it is separated down there.     

177
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,350
It kind of gives it just        
a little bit of a highlight.    

178
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,988
So I've added all my actions,   
I've got my buttons, and        

179
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,026
now I want to make this action  
sheet appear on screen.         

180
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,495
And I do that with              
the normal method that          

181
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,031
we talked about before,         
which is present.               

182
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,201
Remember, present is a view     
controller method that just     

183
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,172
presents the new controller     
using whatever modal            

184
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,808
presentation style is set in    
that view controller which by   

185
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,612
default is modal.               

186
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,915
So the action sheet             
slides at the bottom and        

187
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,386
it's being modally presented.   

188
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,623
So that looks good              
on the iPhone but               

189
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,058
what about on the iPad.         

190
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,627
It would look terrible if       
that huge, if the thing was     

191
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,896
all the way the width of        
the iPad and came up.           

192
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,498
Or if it was just tiny even in  
the middle it was just look     

193
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,533
out of place right there.       

194
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:00,605
So of course on an iPad we put  
this action sheet in a pop      

195
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,207
And whatever button causes us   
to have to do this branching    

196
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,741
over.                           

197
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,677
decision, that's the button     
that we're gonna have           

198
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,213
the little arrow point to.      

199
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,782
So how do we make that work?    

200
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,650
we're presenting this alert     
using the modal style.          

201
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,451
Because right now,              

202
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,821
So it would come up             
modal on the iPad and           

203
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,555
it would look terrible.         

204
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,857
So instead,                     
we just have to go and          

205
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,961
change our action sheet         
MVC here to have a modal        

206
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,132
presentation style              
of pop over.                    

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,900
That means it's gonna still     
present modal but pop over.     

208
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,802
Pop over is                     
basically modal but             

209
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,838
different kind of               
presentation style.             

210
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,941
And of course,                  
when it pops up,                

211
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,911
we want the little arrow        
to point at the redeploy        

212
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,147
button in my bar                
button item there.              

213
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,716
And so we're gonna do that      
with that same pop over         

214
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,719
presentation controller that    
we set the delegate of last     

215
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,921
time so we could                
control the adaptation.         

216
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,056
Remember that from the demo?    

217
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,693
And so we're gonna use that     
same popover presentation       

218
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,295
controller, and this time       
we're gonna set its bar         

219
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,798
button item to be the redeploy  
bar button item, and            

220
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,900
the presentation popover        
presentation controller is      

221
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,737
smart enough to know "I'm       
gonna make my little arrow      

222
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,071
point at that".                 

223
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,507
And as I said before with       
the presentation controller,    

224
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,076
you could also have the little  
arrow point at an arbitrary     

225
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,379
rect in a view or at a button.  

226
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,915
That's it.                      

227
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,885
Now, what happens if we put     
this code in there, this alert  

228
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,454
modes, modal presentation       
popover and we try and          

229
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,824
run, (by the way it should be   
lower-case p popover there).    

230
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,393
And we now try to run           
it back on the iPhone,          

231
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,797
what's it gonna                 
look like there?                

232
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,300
It's gonna look exactly         
the same as it used to.         

233
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,834
And why is that?                

234
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,803
Adaptation, right?              

235
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,674
It's gonna adapt to the fact    
that in this case we have       

236
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,543
a horizontally                  
compact environment.            

237
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,445
And it's not going to           
put it in a popover.            

238
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,346
So that's an automatic          
adaptation,                     

239
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,681
same thing we had before.       

240
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,216
So it'll look fine.             

241
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,752
So if you have an app           
that's universal,               

242
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,654
you'll obviously put            
this little popover code        

243
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,058
in right there and it'll look   
fine on your other device.      

244
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,928
So that's the action sheet,     
what about alert?               

245
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,264
Same thing exactly, basically   
we're just gonna say that       

246
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,034
the preferred style is          
alert in this case.             

247
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,504
Here I'm gonna add              
a cancel button there.          

248
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:18,976
I'm gonna add a login button.   

249
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,546
And I'm also gonna add          
a text field to this one,       

250
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,082
so here's how I add             
a new text field.               

251
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,452
I just say to the MVC,          
the alert MVC, addTextField.    

252
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,022
Notice there's a little         
closure there that I can        

253
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,391
include to configure            
that text field.                

254
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,093
Set the placeholder text.       

255
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,029
Actually, this looks like       
a password, so I'll probably    

256
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,866
want secure text turned on      
in there, things like that.     

257
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,336
Probably would wanna use        
trailing closure syntax there   

258
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,804
instead of using                
the whole thing, but            

259
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,172
I just wanted you to            
see the argument,               

260
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,674
it's called                     
a configuration handler,        

261
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,341
cuz that's what it does.        

262
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,743
It configures the text field.   

263
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,578
You can add more than one       
text field if you want.         

264
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,983
And then, the way you get       
the text out in your action,    

265
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,119
this is sort of the login       
button's action right there.    

266
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,590
I'm gonna get the alert and     
ask for its text fields,        

267
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,091
which is an array               
of text fields,                 

268
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,726
cuz I said you can have         
more than one text field.       

269
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,929
I'm gonna get the first         
one out of there,               

270
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,164
cuz I only have one.            

271
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,566
I could do at sub-zero and      
sub-one, whatever,              

272
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,035
depending on how many I have.   

273
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,970
And, then I'm gonna get         
the text out of it.             

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,707
So now I have the text          
to other text, and so           

275
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:23,475
it's really easy.               

276
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,778
So let's have                   
the TextField work.             

277
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,550
Again with alert style we       
just present it modally.        

278
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,384
Now, in this case,              

279
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,187
we don't present this in        
a popover on the iPad.          

280
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,090
So, it looks exactly the same   
as on the iPhone, a little box  

281
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,228
in the middle, which is okay,   
it actually looks okay there.   

282
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,331
So, nothing special in          
doing the alert case.           

283
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,667
So that's it, that's            
alerts and action sheets.       

284
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,102
I have a little demo.           

285
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,102
FaceIt here.                    

286
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,404
Show you what this looks like.  

287
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,775
Code this up.                   

288
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,876
Here we are in FaceIt,          
where we were before.           

289
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,311
And watch what I'm              
gonna do here.                  

290
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,715
So here I'm pressing            
my add button here to           

291
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,084
do this nice editor MVC.        

292
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,287
What happens here               
if I just hit done?             

293
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:10,922
No.                             

294
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,990
It didn't work.                 

295
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,025
That's weird.                   

296
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:14,692
I'll try again.                 

297
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,395
Let's try something like grin.  

298
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,229
Squinting.                      

299
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:18,863
Done.                           

300
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,699
I just made this work.          

301
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,733
What's going on.                
Well, actually,                 

302
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,871
this did work because look,     
it added one right here.        

303
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,873
It's just the name was blank.   

304
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,511
I went up here, I hit done and  
I didn't put a name.            

305
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,213
So it comes back,               
this is really bad UI,          

306
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,182
because it "worked".            

307
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,818
But this is clear now what the  
user intends, for there to be   

308
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,954
blank lines there they can't    
even tell the difference        

309
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,889
between when there's            
something there or not.         

310
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,791
So really what we'd like is,    
when we click done right here,  

311
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,327
we would like to put            
up an alert if you              

312
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,197
didn't give a name.             

313
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,831
And maybe we'll even            
put a text field in and         

314
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,433
let you type the name           
right there in the alert.       

315
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,602
Which is a little questionable  
UI but it's good for demo.      

316
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,470
So that's what we're gonna do.  

317
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,273
So we're gonna have this        
done button right here,         

318
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,677
put up an alert if              
the name field is empty.        

319
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:07,845
So how do we do that?           

320
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:12,583
Let's go over here to our       
editor MVC, the code here for   

321
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,284
our editor.                     

322
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,152
Remember this code right here.  

323
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,621
Pretty simple.                  

324
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,725
And what I'm gonna do, I wanna  
prevent that unwind segue,      

325
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,295
that done unwind segue,         
I wanna prevent it from         

326
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,164
happening if                    
the name is empty.              

327
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,933
So how do I prevent a segue?    

328
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,203
What's the method that I add?   

329
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,707
I hear whispers of it,          
yes I think I hear it.          

330
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,476
Should perform segue,           
remember that one,              

331
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,514
should perform segue so should  
perform segue with identifier.  

332
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,182
I'm gonna implement that.       

333
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,621
And I'm just gonna say if       
the identifier is my unwind.    

334
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,323
Does anyone remember            
what our identifier was?        

335
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,357
Let's go look it up so          

336
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,726
we can remind ourselves         
how we find it.                 

337
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,662
So, the it was,                 
the unwind out of here.         

338
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,899
Now, of course, we don't get    
to see our unwind segues        

339
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,901
as these little arrow lines.    

340
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,071
We had to go look in our        
document outline over here.     

341
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,741
And click on this MVC and look  
at the bottom right there,      

342
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,079
unwind segment, segue add       
Emotion, we called it.          

343
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,114
When we click on inspector,     
we'll see it, and               

344
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:21,719
we call it Add Emotion, that's  
the identifier for that segue.  

345
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,987
So now we know what             
our segue's called,             

346
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:24,755
let's check it here.            

347
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:28,726
So if the identifier            
is Add Emotion, and             

348
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:34,131
if our name isEmpty,            
then we wanna return false.     

349
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,302
We do not want to allow to      
segue to happen if that's       

350
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,337
empty, otherwise,               
what are we gonna return?       

351
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,275
Well, some people would         
mistakenly say return true.     

352
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,043
But you don't want to           
return true there,              

353
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,915
you want to return super        
should perform segue.           

354
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,584
Because you wanna give your     
super class a chance to,        

355
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,020
it might have some segues, and  
you wanna give it a chance.     

356
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,591
To see if it want to allow      
this particular identifier.     

357
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,294
So don't forget that, when      
you're overriding these things  

358
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,863
don't return true there give    
your super class chance.        

359
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,501
So let's run this just to see   
what this did, we haven't done  

360
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,137
any alert here obviously we're  
just preventing that done.      

361
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,441
Let's see even that             
works there we go.              

362
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,679
Add, I'm not putting a name     
in here, done and turn off.     

363
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,750
It didn't unwind, see but this  
would also be terrible UI.      

364
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,886
The user would think no,        
delete this app,                

365
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,287
it doesn't work.                

366
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,324
This is a broken app,           
I'm clicking this button here.  

367
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,292
It's not doing anything,        
forget it.                      

368
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,395
So you never wanna have a UI    
like that where you press       

369
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,129
a button and                    
it just does nothing,           

370
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,901
that's really bad UI so         
do never do that.               

371
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,604
Instead we want to do           
an alert, so I'm gonna create   

372
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,141
a little function to put        
all this alert stuff in,        

373
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,979
private funk we'll call         
it handle unnamed face.         

374
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,947
And in there we'll do           
our alert business so           

375
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,316
I'm just gonna do it up here,   

376
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,051
I'm gonna handle                
this UnnamedFace.               

377
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,387
When I'm still gonna prevent    
this segway because I cannot    

378
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,656
do the segway when              
this name's empty.              

379
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,358
So I'm still gonna              
return false but I'm            

380
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,727
gonna handle this UnnamedFace   
along the way here.             

381
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,430
So here's handle unnamed face,  

382
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:17,935
I want an alert easy alert      
= UIAlertController.            

383
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,105
Here's the argumnet down here,  
title.                          

384
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,375
Let's have the title be         
something like Invalid Face     

385
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,777
and the message, there's a lot  
of good stuff in the human      

386
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,813
interface guidelines            
about message here.             

387
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,616
You don't want to scold         
your user with these alert      

388
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,683
messages.                       

389
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,718
We want to be nice to them,     
so we just want                 

390
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,154
to kind of explain nicely       
what's going on like.           

391
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,556
We'll just have a face          
must have a name or             

392
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,993
something like that, maybe      
even that's a little harsh.     

393
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,129
But, we'll say, we don't want   
it to be too long but by        

394
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,634
the same token we don't it to   
be, you know, terse and mean.   

395
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,635
So we're kind of somewhere      
in the middle, so               

396
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,203
we'll say "a face               
must have a name".              

397
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,938
And of course the style here,   
what is it?                     

398
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,674
Is it action sheet?             

399
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:01,912
No, it's Alert style, so        
I've created an alert.          

400
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,349
This is a view controller this  
is returning, if I look at      

401
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,853
the type of alert right here,   
it's an alert controller,       

402
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,022
which is a UI view              
controller sub class.           

403
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,924
So I've got this nice thing,    

404
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,093
let's just actually present     
this and see what happens.      

405
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:21,732
Let's go present                
Alert Animated.                 

406
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,069
True, and we don't even         
need a completion handler,      

407
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,571
we rarely need that completion  
handler by the way.             

408
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,808
You know, it just tells you,    
I've finished presenting this   

409
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,211
thing, if you want to           
do something you could.         

410
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,315
Let's go back here.             

411
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,451
Go here, again, I'm not         
putting the name in, done.      

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,819
Well it's better.               

413
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,387
My app is still                 
completely broken though,       

414
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,924
because whoa, I got this        
modal view controller up,       

415
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,725
and there's no way              
to get rid of it.               

416
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,893
So my app is completely dead.   

417
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,261
The only way to                 
get out of this,                

418
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,097
is to literally kill the app.   

419
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:53,798
So we don't want that.          

420
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,801
We never wanna have an alert    
with no buttons, obviously.     

421
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,471
So let's could give it          
a button, go over here.         

422
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,775
To our alert, say               
alert.addAction remember is     

423
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,113
how we do that, and             
it's got a UIAlertAction and    

424
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,049
let's look at the arguments     
here for AlertAction.           

425
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,585
We got a title, so, I'm just    
gonna put an OK button.         

426
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,555
I just got finished telling     
you that you really don't       

427
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,123
wanna have alerts that'd        
only have one button.           

428
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,257
But this is a demo, so          

429
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,925
I'm just showing you            
how to add a button.            

430
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,160
Here's an OK button.            

431
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,595
The style on this               
one is a default,               

432
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,763
it's just a default button,     
it's not destructive, or        

433
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,865
anything like that.             

434
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,001
One could argue this            
should almost be a cancel.      

435
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,437
You're gonna see that I'm not   
gonna make it like a cancel     

436
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,641
appear in a second and          
then the handler, we're not     

437
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,044
doing anything when we click    
OK, so now let's run it again.  

438
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,247
Oops, got a parenthesis there.  

439
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,982
All right, let's run again.     

440
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,919
So here we go, we add,          

441
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,289
not putting a name, hit done,   
comes up invalid face.          

442
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,026
A face must have a name,        
now I'm back here.              

443
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,629
This probably is                
minimally okay, right?          

444
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,601
This is probably fine, the      
user would immediately know,    

445
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,836
I gotta give it a name and      
they go up here and             

446
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,772
give it a name and              
all would be well.              

447
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,841
But in order to show you text   
fields in alert, how about      

448
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,577
when this comes up If give      
give them a text field.         

449
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,380
And let them enter a name, so   
they don't have to go back,     

450
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,281
enter a name, and click Done.   

451
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,885
They can just type the name     
right here, and click OK.       

452
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,987
So how do we do that,           
well one thing in our alert,    

453
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,524
is that we would want           
to add a text field.            

454
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,060
And in configuration handler    
we could figure this            

455
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:30,928
to do whatever we want,         

456
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:35,032
we'll just say we won't have    
a configuration handler here.   

457
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:40,671
And then in our add action,     
when the user click OK,         

458
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,608
I'm gonna look in               
that text field,                

459
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:50,213
get the text out of it and      
put it in my name field.        

460
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,150
Remember that this handler      
gives you the action itself,    

461
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,518
the same alert action.          

462
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,954
It's kind of like if you had    
a delegate method, you'd get    

463
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,190
the thing that's delegating     
same kind of thing here.        

464
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,792
This action here would be       
passed to you in the handler,   

465
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,160
we don't need it though,        

466
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,898
I'm just going to say that      
my self.name/text field.        

467
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:14,738
Its text equals the alerts      

468
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:19,910
text fields, text fields,       

469
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:25,782
text, actually I guess that's   

470
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,454
all I needed to do there.       

471
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,460
Text field is an array.         

472
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,797
So let's grab the first one     
out of there and get its text.  

473
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:43,266
So this is fine except for      
look we're presenting this      

474
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,570
thing before we add the text    
field so that's not good.       

475
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,140
So let's put this down          
here and try again.             

476
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,243
All right, go here,             
we're done.                     

477
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,246
Now I have a text               
field in here,                  

478
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,715
we'll say Foo is the name we    
want, and we click Okay and     

479
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,619
it puts Foo in their name       
text field, excellent.          

480
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,121
However we're still             
making them go back and         

481
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,489
click done again, right?        

482
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,260
Because now I can hit done and  
it works, got this in here.     

483
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,295
But it would be really          
nice if I go into this          

484
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,396
unnamed situation, and          
I typed something here, and     

485
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,700
I click okay, if it would       
just do done automatically.     

486
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:20,470
So does anyone remember how     
we perform a segue from code?   

487
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,271
Cuz that's what we need to do,  

488
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,008
we need to perform that         
unwind from our code.           

489
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,046
I'm gonna do it right here      
in my action handler,           

490
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,949
I'm just gonna say              
self.performSegue.              

491
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,720
Exactly what you would          
think and the identifier?       

492
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,221
It's that add emotion,          

493
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,890
which is the unwind segue and   
the sender.                     

494
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,092
I don't really care             
who the sender is,              

495
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,326
I don't look at                 
that in my prepare,             

496
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,029
I don't need it for             
any reason.                     

497
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,366
That's all that's               
required there.                 

498
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,001
It's a good chance for          

499
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,771
me to show you perform segue,   
segueing from code.             

500
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,409
All done, here we go here.      

501
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,546
Let's do our favorite one       
which is contentment right      

502
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,948
there, so                       
I didn't put the name in here.  

503
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,952
Done, face must have a name,    
I'll say content.               

504
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,521
We click Okay, it comes back.   

505
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,226
Here it is,                     
everybody understand "alert"?   

506
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,663
Alert's pretty straightforward  
to implement, action sheet is   

507
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,099
pretty much exactly the same    
way, no text fields.            

508
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,935
Obviously, in an action sheet,  
but                             

509
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,971
you just add more               
actions in that case.           

510
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,008
All right, back to our slides.  

511
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:40,317
The next thing we're gonna      
talk about Is notifications.    

512
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,554
Notifications are the radio     
station in that MVC             

513
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,091
talk I gave right at            
the beginning of the quarter.   

514
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,527
This is how we can,             
essentially,                    

515
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:55,332
broadcast information blindly   
to other objects in our         

516
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,602
application and have them tune  
in if they're interested.       

517
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,905
So how do we do this?           

518
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,473
The key to making               
notifications work is this      

519
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,576
class called                    
NotificationCenter.             

520
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,080
So there is a default           
NotificationCenter,             

521
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:14,485
which you get by accessing      
the static bar called default   

522
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,985
on NotificationCenter.          

523
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,521
So you have                     
NotificationCenter.default      

524
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,257
gives you this default          
notification center.            

525
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,126
And so you can do two things    
once you have a default         

526
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,160
notification center?            

527
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,331
You can sign up to listen       
to radio broadcast or           

528
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,099
you can broadcast.              

529
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,600
Now who that you                
things you can do,              

530
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,539
super simple API really they    
do nice job with this one.      

531
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,143
So first let's talk about       
how you sign up to listen,      

532
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,344
you wanna listen to             
a certain radio station.        

533
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,947
It's done with this method      
that you send to the default    

534
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,717
notification center             
called add observer.            

535
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,984
So add observer means           

536
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,020
I'm listening to                
this radio station.             

537
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,288
And has three arguments,        
the first one for               

538
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,926
name is the name of             
the radio station.              

539
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,161
Now the type of that is         
NSNotification.name.            

540
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,963
And I'm gonna talk about        
that in a second, but           

541
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,833
that's just the name of radio   
station you what to listen to.  

542
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,368
The second argument             
is object: Any?                 

543
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:11,909
That's basically, in a sense,   
the sender, the broadcaster.    

544
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,876
If you're only listen,          

545
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,279
interested in a radio           
station that's broadcast from   

546
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,881
a certain object, then you      
can put something there.        

547
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,850
If you put nil there, it means  
anybody broadcasting on that    

548
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,419
radio station, I'm interested.  

549
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,055
So it's just a way              
of narrowing down.              

550
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,624
The radio stations are kind     
of weird in that you can have   

551
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,660
multiple people broadcasting    
on the same station.            

552
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,997
It's not like a real radio      
station where it's only one     

553
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,632
radio station.                  

554
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,267
And then a third                
argument is a queue,            

555
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,603
(it's actually four arguments,  
I guess).                       

556
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,439
The third argument is           
a queue that you're gonna run   

557
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,407
this closure on.                

558
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,442
The fourth argument             
is a closure.                   

559
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,644
So you sign up for              
this radio station and          

560
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,281
when there are broadcasts       
this closure get to executed.   

561
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,516
And that queue is               

562
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,984
what queue that closure         
get to execute it on.           

563
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,720
If you say nil,                 
by the way, for                 

564
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,290
that queue you get executed     
on the same queue that          

565
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,094
the radio station broadcaster   
is broadcasting on, but         

566
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,830
very often here you're          
gonna be doing UI stuff.        

567
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,467
In which case, you wanna put    
operation.mainqueue here.       

568
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,036
Operation.main, I think is,     
is what it was called.          

569
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,372
Cuz you obviously need          
to be on main queue             

570
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,973
to do any UI work.              

571
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,775
So inside this closure,         
you can see there's one         

572
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,077
argument which                  
is notification.                

573
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,080
That is the broadcast packet,   

574
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,150
if you wanna think of it        
that was broadcast, and         

575
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,653
inside there there's a couple   
of things but the really        

576
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,689
important thing is something    
called the user info.           

577
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,758
See that                        
notification.userInfo.          

578
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,660
That's a dictionary             
that the broadcaster            

579
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,497
can put any information         
they want for                   

580
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,299
people who are listening        
to this radio station.          

581
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,236
We'll have some examples to     
see what kind of stuff people   

582
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,904
put in their user info.         

583
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,607
So that's it,                   
super straightforward.          

584
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,842
This is how you listen          
to a radio station.             

585
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,313
So let's see, before I          
show you an example of it,      

586
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,148
let's talk about                
NSNotification.Name.            

587
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,552
Its types like this             
which is really nice and        

588
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,088
swift in iOS 10                 
they really typed               

589
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,992
all of the things used to be    
just string, have been type so  

590
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,061
you know what type of thing     
you're looking for here.        

591
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,431
NSNotification.Name, what's     
really cool about that,         

592
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,966
is if you go look at            
the documentation,              

593
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,103
for NSNotification.Name,        
you'll see all                  

594
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,906
of the radio stations that      
iOS will broadcast on.          

595
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,875
And there's a lot of them.      

596
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,412
But it's a great way to         
quickly learn what radio        

597
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,315
stations there                  
are built into IOS.             

598
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,286
They're all static vars, these  
names of the radio stations     

599
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,255
are static vars in              
NSNOtification.Name.            

600
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,458
Now you can create your own     
NSNotification.Name, because    

601
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,727
it's perfectly legal to create  
your own radio station, and     

602
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,128
broadcast if you want.          

603
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,565
You just do that with           
the string initializer for      

604
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,667
the type NSNotification.Name.   

605
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,904
NSNotification.Name, hopefully  
by now you're familiar after    

606
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,204
reading your reading            
assignments and                 

607
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,142
stuff, it's just                
a nested class, name,           

608
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,878
it's a instruct or something    
inside NSNotification.          

609
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:06,483
That's why it's                 
NSNotification.Name.            

610
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,886
So I'll talk about              
broadcasting in a second.       

611
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,688
But first I wanna show you      
an example of listening.        

612
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,058
So here's a radio station,      
a system radio station called   

613
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,361
UIContentSizeCategoryDidCha-    
nge,                            

614
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,829
you see it there                
under the forName.              

615
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,032
And this if you go into your    
settings app on your phone and  

616
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,271
go under accessibility you'll   
see that there is a text size   

617
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,806
setting, looks like the thing   
on the right there,             

618
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,374
where you can set               
the size of your text.          

619
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,110
So when you get old like        
me you can make the text        

620
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:34,845
a little bit bigger and         

621
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,214
still see without having        
any reading glasses.            

622
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,315
When your young like you you    
can make it really small so     

623
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,152
you can get more                
text on screen.                 

624
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,389
So, when that changes           
though all the apps             

625
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,460
find out about it and each of   
them then locally broadcast on  

626
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,928
this radio station.             

627
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,530
Now, radio stations             
are only used for               

628
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,732
broadcasting inside your app.   

629
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,803
So the communication from       
iOS the operating system        

630
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:03,106
to the apps that this changed   
is happening some other way.    

631
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,841
You don't know what it is,      
it's behind the scenes,         

632
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,842
you don't care.                 

633
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,245
But when an app finds out       
that this slider has changed,   

634
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,682
it locally broadcasts on this   
radio station UI content size   

635
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,817
category did change.            

636
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,887
Because those little, that      
slider actually has, like,      

637
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,956
detant marks on there,          
and it's not just, like,        

638
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,391
the point size or the font.     

639
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,161
It's small, medium,             
large, extra large,             

640
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,396
extra extra large.              

641
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,366
So, as you slide                
that thing across.              

642
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,968
So if I want to hear            
about that change,              

643
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,404
now why would I want to         
hear that this is changing?     

644
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,140
I don't need to hear it         
from my fonts because           

645
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,575
I'm being a good                
programmer and                  

646
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,112
I'm using the text              
styles in my UI.                

647
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,214
Remember when we                
went to the UI and              

648
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,350
we set the text style           
to be like body font or         

649
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,953
headline font, or caption       
font, remember when we were     

650
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,556
doing the little                
Tweet Twitter client there?     

651
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,494
So those will automatically     
get updated when this changes.  

652
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,163
But what if I have              
something else an icon or       

653
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:03,266
some other image that really    
wants to size itself depending  

654
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,400
on the surrounding text.        

655
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,870
If the text gets really small   
maybe the icon wants to         

656
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:07,855
if the text gets really big     
the icon wants to get bigger.   

657
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,772
get smaller,                    

658
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:12,876
So I might want to find out,    
so I find out by signing        

659
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:16,880
up to listen to this radio      
station with addObserver.       

660
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,515
And here I'm saying I'm only    

661
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,685
interested if the UI            
application object sends it.    

662
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,188
I can probably put nil there    
actually cuz I don't care who   

663
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,591
sends this I know it's going    
to be the application object,   

664
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,993
but I don't really care.        

665
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,662
And I am going to execute this  
on the main queue because       

666
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,531
I am going to do UI things for  

667
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,968
sure, in reaction to that       
size category changing.         

668
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,537
And then inside my closure I    
look at the notification and    

669
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,941
in the dictionary there I'm     
looking for the key called      

670
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,011
UIContentSizeCategoryNewValue-  
Key.                            

671
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,513
And I found out about that      

672
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,182
by looking in                   
the documentation under         

673
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:55,585
NSNotification.Name.UIContent-  
SizeCategoryDidChange.          

674
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,688
And when I looked at that       
particular radio station.       

675
00:30:58,757 --> 00:30:59,723
It said in the documentation,   

676
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,459
hey, you can use                
UIContentSizeCategoryNewValu-   

677
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,896
eKey to get out of the          
dictionary the size category.   

678
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,297
In other words the position     
of that slider.                 

679
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,767
And so an example what the      
value might be of that would    

680
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,170
be UIContentSizeCategorySmall.  

681
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,706
So now I found out, and         

682
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,174
I'll find out every             
time that changes.              

683
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,677
I'll get a broadcast and        
it'll tell me.                  

684
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,212
Now, I didn't really            
talk about this, but            

685
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,381
notice that addObserver,        
that notification,              

686
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,618
default notification center     
method, it returned something.  

687
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:33,223
This thing observer, which is   
of type NS object protocol.     

688
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,958
Basically it's a cookie.        

689
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:35,859
You don't what it is,           

690
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,728
you don't know what type        
it is, all you use it for,      

691
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,498
is later when you're no longer  
interested in hearing about     

692
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,033
this, you remove                
this observer.                  

693
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,370
That's, that's saying to        
the notification center,        

694
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,473
I don't wanna hear about this   
radio station anymore, so       

695
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,174
don't send me                   
anymore broadcasts.             

696
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:55,312
Now it's really                 
important to do that.           

697
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,482
So usually we're going to       
do something UI-oriented        

698
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,518
like this.                      

699
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,121
And then in view                
will disappear,                 

700
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,456
we're gonna remove observer     
because it makes no sense to    

701
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,192
listen to this radio station    
and adjust our icon sizes and   

702
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,761
stuff when we're                
not on screen.                  

703
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,031
Now of course, this might       
happen while we're off screen.  

704
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,902
So perhaps in our view did      
appear, or view will appear,    

705
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,973
we might want to adjust         
our icon sizes based on         

706
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,307
this content size category.     

707
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,276
Which you can get that          
from the UI application,        

708
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,044
you can just ask it what        
it is and it will tell you,     

709
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,981
you don't have to, have to get  
a radio station notification,   

710
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,317
to find out what it is.         

711
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,320
That's an example of            
listening to a radio station.   

712
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:41,024
Now what about sending on       
a radio station, broadcasting.  

713
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,259
That's super simple, as well.   

714
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,193
You get that default            
notification center, and        

715
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,663
you're gonna use                
the method post.                

716
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,433
Post takes the name of          
the radio station to post on,   

717
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,402
which again, you can invent     
your own if you want.           

718
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,838
The object, that's the sender,  
in case people might only be    

719
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,975
interested in this being        
broadcast from certain people.  

720
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,278
Usually, this would be self,    
that you would put there.       

721
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,713
And then there's                
the user info.                  

722
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,983
That's that dictionary that     
you get to pass to them.        

723
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,919
So, that's the same user        
info they're gonna get.         

724
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:14,691
So, as soon as you              
execute this post               

725
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,861
all listeners, all people       
who did addObserver, who        

726
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,864
are listening on, for their     
closure to execute on the same  

727
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,202
queue as your posting this      
on will immediately execute.    

728
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,072
All the other ones, so          

729
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,040
if you're posting this          
off the main queue for          

730
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,344
example and you're observers    
are all on the main queue.      

731
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,679
Their closures will just        
be put on the queue,            

732
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,648
they'll be put on               
the main queue, and             

733
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,685
they'll execute the next        
opportunity that they have.     

734
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,324
So that's it, posting and       
posting to broadcasts on        

735
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,193
the radio station, by the way   
radio station that's just       

736
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,395
something I made up,            
nobody calls it that,           

737
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,364
you're not gonna see            
that in the docs,               

738
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,033
it's just a analogy for         
what's going on here.           

739
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,136
That's notifications.           

740
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,739
There's another kind of         
radio station model thing,      

741
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,609
which I'm not talking about,    
which is key value observing.   

742
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,545
And you might wanna look        
up in the docs as well.         

743
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:13,583
That's a way that you can       
sign up to find out if a var    

744
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,819
on some other object changes.   

745
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,590
So, take a look at that if you  
might be interested in that.    

746
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,695
The next topic here is          
the application life cycle.     

747
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,397
You know how we have            
a view life cycle,              

748
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,799
we have an application one too  
and you get to find out as      

749
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,934
your application goes           
through its life cycle.         

750
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,472
So first let me talk about the  
states that your application    

751
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,139
can be in.                      

752
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,743
It can be in really one         
of five conditions.             

753
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,411
One is the top not running.     

754
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,779
So that's, user has never,      

755
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,415
not run your app,               
obviously you're not running.   

756
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,885
Your code,                      
there's no code executing in    

757
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,620
any way related to your app.    

758
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,355
No one's touched on             
your icon or anything.          

759
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,893
Then there's two                
foreground states               

760
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,095
after your app starts running.  

761
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,397
One is called                   
the inactive state.             

762
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,867
In the inactive state,          
you don't get any events.       

763
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,568
You can't draw any UI.          

764
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:09,305
You're just kind of like        
preparing to, to really run.    

765
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,273
You're not active.              

766
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,041
You're not being                
shown on screen.                

767
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,244
The user's not                  
interacting with you.           

768
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,113
The other one the other         
foreground state is active,     

769
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,515
now this is the normal          
state where you're getting      

770
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,119
touch events, you're drawing    
on screen, you're interacting   

771
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,188
user perceives you as           
an active application.          

772
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,059
Then there's also               
the background state.           

773
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,728
Now the background state        
is even less running than       

774
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,533
the foreground inactive state,  
in the background state you're  

775
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,705
clearly not on screen and not   
only are you not on screen and  

776
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:46,008
interacting you're barely       
running in the background and   

777
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,445
your lifetime                   
there is limited.               

778
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,548
You're probably not gonna run   
for more than 30 seconds.       

779
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,417
This is a transitory            
state between                   

780
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,585
being in the foreground and     

781
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,419
going to the next state         
I'm gonna talk about,           

782
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,989
which is to be suspended.       

783
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,624
So, if you're suspended,        

784
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:04,561
no code in your                 
application is running.         

785
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,629
You're still in memory, but     

786
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,264
you're just sitting             
there not running.              

787
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,499
You get no cycles.              

788
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:15,137
Now, one thing you have to be,  
you have to kind of understand  

789
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,074
about how this life cycle       
works is that you transition    

790
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,911
through these states            
in an orderly fashion.          

791
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,480
So when you launch,             
you go from not running,        

792
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,849
to this foreground              
inactive state, to active.      

793
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,819
You always transition through   
inactive to get to active.      

794
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,922
When some other app is          
switched to, someone launches   

795
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,858
another app and you're the you  
were the active app, you go     

796
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,428
from active back to inactive    
in the foreground briefly,      

797
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:44,300
then around down to background  
for up to 30 seconds or         

798
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,603
so and then you get suspended   
where you don't run at all.     

799
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,373
So you always transition        
through that flow to go         

800
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,276
from you're the active          
app to somebody else's          

801
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,144
the other deactive app.         

802
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,149
Now when you're in              
suspended state and             

803
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,718
you get killed for              
whatever reason.                

804
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,287
You go straight to killed and   
no code of yours runs from      

805
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,224
the time you're suspended,      
to the time you get killed.     

806
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,526
Why do you get killed?          

807
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,395
Well, maybe the user            
killed you, explicitly.         

808
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,097
Maybe you started using         
too much memory and             

809
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,064
the system killed you.          

810
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,401
Maybe the phone's battery       
died, it got re-booted, for     

811
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,735
some reason, whatever.          

812
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,604
So when you're in               
the suspended state,            

813
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,773
you kind of have to be          
ready to just be killed.        

814
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,275
So you wouldn't want to         
have any unsaved data, or       

815
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,744
anything else going             
on in that state,               

816
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,779
that's why you get              
the background state,           

817
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:30,947
to kinda get ready for that.    

818
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,017
Now, at each of these arrows,   
these orange arrows,            

819
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,622
you get a message sent to       
your application delegate.      

820
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,190
So far, we've only              
used the application            

821
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,627
delegate to have our little     
core data stuff in there.       

822
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,895
But there's a bunch             
of methods in there.            

823
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,064
You've seen them every time     
you look and you had delegate.  

824
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,233
And we're gonna talk about      
what they all do and            

825
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,534
when they're all called.        

826
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,737
So the first one in your app    
delegate is called application  

827
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,773
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.  

828
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:57,407
There's also                    

829
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,241
a willFinishLaunchingWithOpti-  
ons.                            

830
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,510
And it gives you                
this dictionary.                

831
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,144
And the dictionary,             

832
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,647
the keys are                    
UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey,  

833
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,216
which you can look in the       
documentation for that symbol.  

834
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,318
And you'll find all the         
various things that can appear  

835
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,486
in this dictionary.             

836
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,456
And the values depend           
on what the key is.             

837
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,491
By the way, all of these        
app delegate methods,           

838
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,195
you can also get by listening   
to this radio stations.         

839
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,396
So the radio station for        

840
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,965
this one is the                 
UIApplicationDidFinishLauching  

841
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,969
radio station and it's          
notification .name.that If you  

842
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,704
listen to that you'll get,      
and you do add observer,        

843
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,474
you'll get your closer called   
when did launch finish          

844
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,277
launching happens, so you       
don't have to put it in your    

845
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:38,014
app delegate you could put it   
in other places other code.     

846
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:41,384
What happens here in this       
DidFinishLaunchWithOptions      

847
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,086
what why does it get            
called things like that,        

848
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,489
why do you have                 
this dictionary?                

849
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,559
Well, obviously when you        
normally launch, this gets      

850
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,361
called, the dictionary          
doesn't have anything in it.    

851
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,697
Because you just got            
launch normally,                

852
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,764
the user clicked on             
your icon and launched.         

853
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,200
But there are a lot             
of other ways for               

854
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,435
you to get launch               
to buy the system.              

855
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,304
And when those                  
other ways happen,              

856
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,405
then you're gonna have this     
dictionary to tell you why,     

857
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,407
and give you                    
the information you need.       

858
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,110
So one thing, for example,      

859
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,112
is if your application opens    
a certain kind of document,     

860
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,682
let's say you're a PDF viewer   
and you know how to open PDF    

861
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,551
files and you've registered     
that with the system.           

862
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,287
Then if someone in some other   
app says, open this PDF,        

863
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,157
the system's gonna launch you.  

864
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,826
And when it launches you,       
in the dictionary right there   

865
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,729
is gonna be that                
URL with some key.              

866
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,464
It's telling you to open it.    

867
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,068
And so that's an example,       
another one is,                 

868
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,403
you have set up, you can        
set up with core location.      

869
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,706
I didn't get to talk about      
core location this quarter,     

870
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,443
but you can set up a core       
location mechanism, whereby,    

871
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,614
if you go by someplace in       
the world, the dry cleaner,     

872
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,382
just the canonical example,     

873
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:50,052
when you walk by the dry        
cleaner, your app will launch.  

874
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,422
So you could set it up and      
if that happens again,          

875
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,258
this dictionary will say,       
hey I launched you because you  

876
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,460
went to one of your             
registered locations and        

877
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,462
here it is when you worked.     

878
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,998
You can also do it for          
continuing activities.          

879
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,700
I don't know if you guys        
know about this feature,        

880
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,735
it's kind of a nice feature.    

881
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,371
You start browsing something    
on your phone, and              

882
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,672
then you switch                 
over to your iPad.              

883
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,241
You can continue browsing       
from exactly where you were.    

884
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,410
So you might get                
launched to do that,            

885
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,712
to continue doing               
what you were doing.            

886
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,881
If you get a push               
notification,                   

887
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,885
we didn't really talk about     
notifications much except for   

888
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,421
in the cloud kit section,       
I hope you,                     

889
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,725
how many of you saw the cloud   
kit Friday section?             

890
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,194
It's only a few of you, it's    
worth going back and looking    

891
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,898
at just to see notifications    
and push notifications.         

892
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:38,134
But if you get a push           
notification sent to you and    

893
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,602
your app's not running,         

894
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,905
it may get launched             
to handle that thing.           

895
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,908
Or if you have some Bluetooth   
device that you connect with,   

896
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,110
it, it gets in range and        
it gets launched.               

897
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,111
So there's a lot                
of reasons your                 

898
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,179
application might               
get launched.                   

899
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,113
And when it does,               

900
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,083
that dictionary's going         
to have the information         

901
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,453
related to that                 
particular launch.              

902
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,722
Now I'm gonna warn you of       
something, when you're doing    

903
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,757
your final project,             
you're gonna be searching on    

904
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,826
the Internet all the time       
to find ways to do things.      

905
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,328
And you might run across        
really old posts, which you     

906
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,298
can often tell because they're  
in Objective C versus Swift.    

907
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,934
But if you ever                 
see a post where                

908
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:15,704
someone in their application    
did finish launching with       

909
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,408
options is like saying UI       
split view controller init,     

910
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,344
or navigation init.             

911
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,247
And they're building their      
UI in code right there,         

912
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,516
that's pre-story board code,    

913
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:30,086
we do that stuff in             
the story board now.            

914
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,756
The times that we build any     
UI in application did finish    

915
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,492
launching, 0.001% of the time.  

916
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:41,263
So I just wanna make sure you   
don't get confused by that.     

917
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,767
So this little delegate method  
is sent with that arrow         

918
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,601
right there.                    

919
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,836
You see the arrow               
that's down there?              

920
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,605
So that's the arrow where       
you go from not running         

921
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,307
into being inactive.            

922
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,043
So you're running,              
you can do stuff, but           

923
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:54,677
you're not on screen.           

924
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,946
So in                           
ApplicationDidFinishLaunching   

925
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,348
with options, you could         
be building your UI, but        

926
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,883
you can't put it                
on screen yet.                  

927
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,017
I mean,                         
it won't appear on screen       

928
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,119
cuz you're still inactive.      

929
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,123
Now I wanna talk briefly        
about an opposite               

930
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,027
arrow there that can go         
into the inactive state.        

931
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,962
You can get into inactive       
from running, but               

932
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,498
you can also get inactive       
when you were running.          

933
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:23,038
And things happen, like you     
switch to another app, other    

934
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,874
things can happen that cause    
you to go back to the inactive  

935
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,644
state, where you no             
longer can do UI.               

936
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:33,416
This transition, which is the   
WillResignActive transition,    

937
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:36,685
you want to think of            
that as the pause button.       

938
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,521
This is where your              
app wants to pause.             

939
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,624
So if we were doing             
an asteroids app,               

940
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,760
I'd want to stop all            
of my asteroids,                

941
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,696
remember what their             
velocities were.                

942
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,299
And be in a pause state.        

943
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,833
And then I'll show              
you what I'm gonna              

944
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,335
unpause in a second here.       

945
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,203
Then bring it all back.         

946
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,605
So this is pause, I like to     
think of this one as pause,     

947
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,108
you're going from being         
the active app where your UI's  

948
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,609
working to this                 
inactive state.                 

949
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,910
You're still in                 
the foreground.                 

950
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,813
Now what causes                 
this to happen?                 

951
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,615
A phone call comes in,          
when a phone call comes in,     

952
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,784
your app kind of is             
in the background.              

953
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,018
It's, you can't do any UI,      

954
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,922
it gets no events because the   
person's talking on the phone.  

955
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,356
But as soon as their            
phone call ends,                

956
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,925
you go back to being            
the active state,               

957
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,360
you never went into             
the background.                 

958
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,828
You just were                   
foreground inactive.            

959
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,232
Or you'll pass                  
through this arrow              

960
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,867
on your way to the background.  

961
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,270
Someone did click on            
another app, and so             

962
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,606
you're transitioning back       
here, still wanna pause.        

963
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,142
And then you're gonna go to     
the background, gonna clean up  

964
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,544
some more cuz you might         
get terminated later.           

965
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,581
But here, you still,            
i's worth pausing as you pass   

966
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,785
through here, so tha's          
what the resign state is.       

967
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,754
This other arrow going          
in the other direction,         

968
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,390
this is when your app           
really starts up.               

969
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,793
So this is when your            
UI is available.                

970
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,796
Here's where you                
wanna unpause.                  

971
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,166
If you have paused,             
then here's where you unpause,  

972
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,802
is in this DidBecomeActive.     

973
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,505
Because you're gonna pass       
through this on your way back   

974
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,241
from being in the background    
or when the phone call ends,    

975
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,742
then you're gonna go active.    

976
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,678
So this is the unpause.         

977
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,848
Now you only unpause            
obviously if you're paused.     

978
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,084
You never paused,               
then there's no unpause here.   

979
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,186
This little arrow               
down in the corner,             

980
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,290
this is                         
the DidEnterBackground state,   

981
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,759
this is where you wanna         
batten down the hatches.        

982
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,662
You wanna save any              
unsaved information,            

983
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,564
you've already                  
paused probably,                

984
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,235
because you went up through     
the active, can't get there     

985
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,438
from active, unless you went    
through the inactive pause.     

986
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,440
See how the arrows go there,    
so                              

987
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,541
here's where you                
wanna save things.              

988
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,278
You wanna get yourself in       
the state, you got about 30     

989
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,480
seconds to do it where          
you could be killed and         

990
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,782
usually would lose any data or  
anything.                       

991
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,351
This is also a good             
place maybe to                  

992
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,754
save your state a little bit,   
so if you did get killed and    

993
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:52,788
you got run again,              

994
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,291
you could start up              
exactly where you were.         

995
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,493
And there's actually            
certain infrastructure in       

996
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,728
UI application, which           
I'll mention in a second,       

997
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,762
to do that.                     

998
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,567
So this is the batten down      
the hatches area right here,    

999
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,135
the transition.                 

1000
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,538
When you come back out          
of the background, so           

1001
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,407
you were in the background or   

1002
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:15,844
suspended, when you come back   
out, you're gonna get this      

1003
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,115
ApplicationWillEnterForegro-    
und.                            

1004
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,718
So, that's the thing that       
says, you will, back up,        

1005
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:25,788
this is where you can unbatten  
down the hatches if you         

1006
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,290
wanna open some files           
that you had closed or          

1007
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,859
something like that,            
you can do that here.           

1008
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,227
Have you got that?              

1009
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,364
So these are the transitions    
you make through the lifetime   

1010
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,732
of your application.            

1011
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:39,802
The ApplicationDelegate is      
involved in a lot of other      

1012
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,970
things as well besides          
just the lifecycle.             

1013
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,506
For example, state              
restoration, this is the thing  

1014
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,242
I was telling you be, just      
moments ago, where you can      

1015
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,578
save your state, so that when   
you launch again, yo're in      

1016
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:52,114
exactly the same state on       
the same view controller.       

1017
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,785
Maybe even your first           
responder is the same blinking  

1018
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,319
cursor and the same             
text field or whatever,         

1019
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,054
you can save all that,          
there's a whole mechanism for   

1020
00:45:59,123 --> 00:45:59,688
doing that.                     

1021
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,323
You can take a look             
at it if you want,              

1022
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,326
might be a good thing to get a  
rubric point out of in there.   

1023
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:08,030
Also data protection, so        
the data on your phone          

1024
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:12,535
is protected by default when    
you're in the locked state.     

1025
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,303
Your phone is locked.           

1026
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,972
Then all the phone,             
data on it is encrypted, so     

1027
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,642
even if someone broke into      
the phone somehow and           

1028
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,610
got the data out                
of the static ram.              

1029
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,113
It would all be encrypted,      
so it'll be useless anyway.     

1030
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:25,848
So the AppDelegate              
can tell you when               

1031
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:28,317
data becomes unencrypted and    
available for use.              

1032
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,387
In other words, unlock, the     
screen has been unlocked, or    

1033
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,156
when it goes back               
to being locked.                

1034
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,759
You can open URLs               
in other apps.                  

1035
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,362
There's a method, I think you   
wanted the extra credit items.  

1036
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,430
Or maybe we've even made it as  

1037
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,298
part of the required            
task of one.                    

1038
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,767
So you probably know            
how to do that.                 

1039
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:46,635
This is the other way around.   

1040
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:52,141
This is someone's asking you    
to open a URL in AppDelegate.   

1041
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,708
So this is: you'll              
get this message,               

1042
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,245
your AppDelegate saying, hey,   
this, some other app wants you  

1043
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,413
to open this URL, and           
you can go do it.               

1044
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,782
Similar to if you               
got launched,                   

1045
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,283
if you didn't get               
launched to it,                 

1046
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,751
because if you got              
launched to it,                 

1047
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,987
it's gonna be in that           
dictionary, but otherwise,      

1048
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,755
you'll get this method.         

1049
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,523
And there's also                
a whole mechanism for           

1050
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,992
background fetching.            

1051
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,661
Sometimes you might have an     
app, it's a social media app.   

1052
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,996
And you wanna have up           
to date information for         

1053
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,300
the user at all times, so that  
if they launch, they're seeing  

1054
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,637
the latest posts on your        
Facebook page, or whatever.     

1055
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,373
And to do that, you can set     
up this background fetching.    

1056
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,742
Now, the background fetching    
is not happening once a minute  

1057
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,542
or anything like that.          

1058
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,944
It's happening, you know,       

1059
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,612
occasionally in                 
the background, and             

1060
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,981
if you try to do too much,      
the system,                     

1061
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,985
will get upset at you and stop  
doing, scheduling you so much.  

1062
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,254
But what happens here in the    
background fetching is, you     

1063
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,658
move from the suspended state   
into the background state for   

1064
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,559
30 seconds or less, usually.    

1065
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,695
And you go you get to go        
fetch on the network or         

1066
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,130
get your latest information,    
and                             

1067
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,166
then you go back to suspended.  

1068
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,034
So that way if you go           
suspended background,           

1069
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,804
foreground active really        
quick, you got the data.        

1070
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,542
There's a few other things,     
but that's mostly what          

1071
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,179
the ApplicationDelegate         
is all about.                   

1072
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,415
Now application delegate of     
course has to be a delegate     

1073
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,349
of some object.                 

1074
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,985
And it's a delegate             
of UI application.              

1075
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,788
So UI application is a class    
there's only a single instance  

1076
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,557
that you ever                   
have in your app.               

1077
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,526
You get it by saying            
UIApplication.shared and        

1078
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,296
it manages all                  
the global behavior.            

1079
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,898
Which sounds like, wow this     
is really important object.     

1080
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,233
But actually it's               
not that important.             

1081
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,369
You almost never interact with  
UIApplication, because it       

1082
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:31,240
delegates all the interesting   
things to its app delegates.    

1083
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,442
But there are a few             
things that you can do in       

1084
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:34,543
UIApplication.                  

1085
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:39,281
For example, here's where you   
can open URL in another app     

1086
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,384
you can register to receive     
push notifications here.        

1087
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,954
Push notifications              
your app will not get           

1088
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,090
unless you call this            
registerForRemoteNotifications  

1089
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,157
in UIApplication.               

1090
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,994
By the way, notifications,      
push notifications and          

1091
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:56,398
local notifications have been   
unified in iOS 10 to this UN    

1092
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,433
notifications framework.        

1093
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,103
A local notification, a push    
notification you probably know  

1094
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,238
what this is that's when        
some server send you            

1095
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,707
some information like in        
the cloud kit case where it's   

1096
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,443
telling you hey some data       
changed in your data base.      

1097
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,313
But local notification          
are kind of cool as well.       

1098
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,783
You can set up local            
notification that will fire at  

1099
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:14,583
a certain time.                 

1100
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,253
That's how a calendar app       
reminds you when you have       

1101
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,090
a particular appointment or     
rather it's using local         

1102
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,195
notifications and you schedule  
them for a certain time.        

1103
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,531
I think you can also do local   
notifications for location      

1104
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,435
changes, and you get near       
the dry cleaner or whatever.    

1105
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,704
So local notifications,         

1106
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:37,973
put push notifications          
are unified in iOS 10 and       

1107
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,910
it's not part of UIApplication  
it's this other framework.      

1108
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,613
Unfortunately I didn't          
have time to go over that.      

1109
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,215
By the way also local           
notifications is different      

1110
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,985
from NSnotification,            
or just notification.           

1111
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:52,320
Notification is that            
radio station thing,            

1112
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,457
local notification, and push    
notification are the, this      

1113
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,460
other mechanism for notifying   
the user which is actually      

1114
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,430
completely different not        
related to each other at all.   

1115
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,702
In application you can also     
set the fetching interval for   

1116
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,638
that background fetching        
thing I talked about.           

1117
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,274
If you get into                 
the background and              

1118
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,611
you need more time, because     
30 seconds is not enough.       

1119
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,949
Something is blocking or        
you need to get something from  

1120
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,616
the network and                 
you want some more time.        

1121
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,753
You can ask for more time by    
asking the UI application       

1122
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,456
object to begin                 
a background task.              

1123
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,258
Now, again,                     
you can't abuse this.           

1124
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:31,293
If you keep asking for          
more and more time, and         

1125
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,628
you're trying to run for        
ten minutes,                    

1126
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,898
eventually the system's         
gonna say, that's enough.       

1127
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,533
This is for, just exceptional   
circumstances where,            

1128
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,468
"argh, I need another           
minute please".                 

1129
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,238
Can I have some more time?      

1130
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,807
And it'll give it to you as     
long as you don't abuse it.     

1131
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,678
The little spinner in the       
upper left hand corner of your  

1132
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,647
device, okay, that spins.       

1133
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,314
Have you ever seen that thing   
spinning when you're doing      

1134
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,550
something on the network?       

1135
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,418
You can control that,           
you can turn it on and          

1136
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,921
off with this bool              
in UIApplication.               

1137
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,324
You can also find out a lot of  
information like remember that  

1138
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,928
category sizer, the little      
slider text size slider.        

1139
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,963
You can find out what           
the preferred content slide     

1140
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,931
category currently is.          

1141
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,067
You can find out how much       
time you got remaining          

1142
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,803
on your background,             
sitting in the background.      

1143
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:16,372
You can also find               
which state you're in,          

1144
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,341
foreground inactive,            
foreground active background.   

1145
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,210
You can find out which of       
those states you're in.         

1146
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,878
So you're application's         
a little bit of a clearing      

1147
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,313
house for that kind of          
global information.             

1148
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,516
So that's it for                
UIApplication.                  

1149
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,654
Info.plist, we've               
already seen Info.plist.        

1150
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:36,291
Info.plist is really like       
a raw data file that's storing  

1151
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,228
a lot of your                   
application's settings.         

1152
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:43,032
We saw the one where            
we had HTTP URLs and            

1153
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,267
we want it to allow             
those unsecure ones,            

1154
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,769
remember that the app           
transport security.             

1155
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,807
We actually went and            
edited our Info.plist.          

1156
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:54,609
You can see it looks like       
this when you click on it.      

1157
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,778
This is a property              
list editor right here.         

1158
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,147
So on the left hand side        
you're gonna have strings and   

1159
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,383
dictionaries and arrays.        

1160
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,052
Things that property lists      
are allowed to have.            

1161
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,152
And on the right                
you're gonna have               

1162
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,554
the values that are in there.   

1163
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,257
This is really                  
backing an XML file,            

1164
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,358
this property list that         
stores an XML file.             

1165
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,928
You can actually                
right-click on it and           

1166
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:14,763
edit it as an XML file.         

1167
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,465
I strongly recommend            
against this because            

1168
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,134
you can break this so easily.   

1169
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:22,104
And then now the app won't be   
able to read this info.plist    

1170
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,440
anymore, so I recommend         
against doing that.             

1171
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,276
But usually all                 
these settings,                 

1172
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,913
you edit them in the project    
settings, right.                

1173
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,015
You're not going                
to the Info.plist.              

1174
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,583
But it doesn't                  
happen to be one or             

1175
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,485
at least I've never found       
one for that app transport      

1176
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,555
security, but maybe they want   
it intentionally obscure        

1177
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,792
because they want your app      
to be secure in that way.       

1178
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,995
But you've seen many,           
many settings here,             

1179
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,497
like do we allow a portrait     
upside down, and                

1180
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:52,935
things like that, these are     
all stored in the Info.plist.   

1181
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:56,805
So this settings UI that        
you see is pretty much          

1182
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,308
an editor also on               
Info.plist for                  

1183
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,143
a lot of the things             
that you see there.             

1184
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,681
Another thing that you'll       
see in your settings            

1185
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,616
are capabilities.               

1186
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,785
They're a number of features,   

1187
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:14,489
couple dozen maybe, that        
require an external server.     

1188
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,025
Some external resource          
like iCloud or                  

1189
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:20,061
like CloudKit, requires some    
server that's storing all that  

1190
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,930
data out there or Game Center.  

1191
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:25,200
Is has all the servers so       
people can get together and     

1192
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,068
play games and                  
things like that.               

1193
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:31,073
When you have that kind of      
thing where you essentially     

1194
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:33,308
need your app to be             
authenticated so                

1195
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:37,646
that it it the server you're    
talking to knows it's you.      

1196
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,649
Then you're going to have to    
go to the capabilities tab in   

1197
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,619
the project settings and        
turn it on.                     

1198
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:47,222
And turning it on, basically    
means update my entitlements    

1199
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,926
so that I'm entitled to         
do this particular thing.       

1200
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,529
So, see some of the examples    
up there besides iCloud and     

1201
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,064
Game Center at the top,         
you have Apple Pay,             

1202
00:53:56,132 --> 00:54:00,569
In App Purchases, obviously     
these things require servers    

1203
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,303
and people connecting           
to them and things.             

1204
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,405
Even the background             
fetching modes and              

1205
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:08,643
things like that require some   
entitlement if you're gonna be  

1206
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,179
doing fetching while            
in the background.              

1207
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,882
So, check these out, this is    
a cool thing just to see what   

1208
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,350
features there are out there.   

1209
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,653
Again, maybe way to             
get add some breadth,           

1210
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,922
some of them are not that       
difficult to implement,         

1211
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,225
simple versions of anyway.      

1212
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:27,396
But, you have to turn these     
on just to enable them.         

1213
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:34,169
My last topic here              
today is persistence.           

1214
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:37,839
So persistence just means       
making data stay on the disk    

1215
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:40,775
when after your app             
is killed or dies.              

1216
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,345
You already know about two      
really important ones.          

1217
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:47,048
User defaults which is tiny     
little pieces of data,          

1218
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,518
preferences kind of data.       

1219
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,253
And has to be in                
PropertyLIst format.            

1220
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:54,523
And then there's Core Data,     
which is kind of the opposite.  

1221
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:59,928
Monster relational database     
can have huge data in there.    

1222
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,264
It's really for                 
a data centric applications,    

1223
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,733
applications where the data     
is what is all about.           

1224
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,734
So, I'm not gonna               
talk about those.               

1225
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,902
You know about those.           

1226
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,204
I'm going to talk about         
these last three briefly.       

1227
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,472
Archiving.                      

1228
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:15,043
So archiving is a way of        
storing an object graph that    

1229
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,813
is not a property               
list on disk.                   

1230
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:20,815
Your storyboard is archived.    

1231
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,418
Take all those views            
archives them to disk.          

1232
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,853
So, I talked about that.        

1233
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,789
SQLite, we all                  
know what SQL is,               

1234
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,991
its relation on                 
database technology.            

1235
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:35,563
iOS comes with kind of a light  
version of SQL at which         

1236
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,632
you don't usually ever use      
cuz you're using Core Data.     

1237
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,269
Core Data's actually built      
on top of SQLite which          

1238
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,438
you don't have to               
access SQL directly.            

1239
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,373
And finally,                    
you can make things persist by  

1240
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,609
putting them in                 
the Unix file system.           

1241
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,510
iOS, put Unix underneath, so    

1242
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,480
you can put things              
in that file system.            

1243
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,482
We'll talk about                
how to do that.                 

1244
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,585
So, let's talk about            
archiving thing.                

1245
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:01,389
Do not get the idea that        
this is a good way to           

1246
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,959
have an arbitrary object        
graph that you have, and        

1247
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,460
store it on disc.               

1248
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,764
Because archiving               
requires the involvement        

1249
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,867
of all the objects that         
want to be archived.            

1250
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,203
Each of them has to implement   
these two methods up here       

1251
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:19,741
in code which essentially       
takes your object and           

1252
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,377
converts it into a dictionary.  

1253
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,247
Not quite that, but             
that's 90% of what it is.       

1254
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,516
So converts to dictionary.      

1255
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:30,051
And then it also has to         
implement this initializer,     

1256
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,020
any object that wants to be     
archived has to implement       

1257
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:32,954
this initializer.               

1258
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,490
Which essentially gives you     
back that dictionary and        

1259
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,293
tells you to create             
your objects from it.           

1260
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:41,229
Now this is kind of special,    

1261
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,599
this mechanism because          
the system is smart enough to   

1262
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:47,802
know when you put an object     
in your dictionary.             

1263
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,539
And someone else in             
the same object graph           

1264
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:53,575
puts that object in there       
if that's the same object.      

1265
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,345
So it's not gonna ask that      
object to reconstitute itself   

1266
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,179
twice it's only gonna           
ask to do it once and           

1267
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,882
then it's gonna make            
pointers to it.                 

1268
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,651
So this is how the storyboard   
can work, if you think about    

1269
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,787
the storyboard,                 
it's got a view hierarchy.      

1270
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,356
All those views are pointing    
to other views in their         

1271
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,224
subviews but                    

1272
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,893
they're also pointing           
back to their superviews.       

1273
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:15,063
And obviously you only want     
one copy of every view in       

1274
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,231
that hierarchy.                 

1275
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,768
So UI view implements this      
coding protocol that has this   

1276
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,004
methods in it.                  

1277
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:25,240
And that's why view can be      
archived and all the sub cost   

1278
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,709
of UI view that come            
with iOS like label and         

1279
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,777
button they also                
implement this.                 

1280
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,780
And that's why the storyboard   
could be archived.              

1281
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,552
But in the end if you           
start having an arbitrary       

1282
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,071
you try to implement this in    
code and UI for all of thems.   

1283
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:40,522
object graph, and               

1284
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:43,692
It starts to be more work       
than for example, just          

1285
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,996
making a core data database,    
to store that data in.          

1286
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:50,432
Or converting it to             
a property list and             

1287
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,401
using user defaults if          
it's a small thing.             

1288
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,072
So this people here listen and  
they're like, that's cool,      

1289
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,674
yeah I've got a big             
object graph of data and        

1290
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,643
I'm just gonna put it           
on this using this.             

1291
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:05,680
Well it's a little more         
involved than you might think.  

1292
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:08,416
And it also, you have to know   
what you're doing here to make  

1293
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,386
sure you get those back         
pointers properly set up and    

1294
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:12,154
things like that.               

1295
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:17,892
SQLite, so                      
this is SQL in a single file,   

1296
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,962
one gigantic file               
the entire SQL database.        

1297
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,299
It's not a network thing it's   
purely just a local file.       

1298
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:28,570
SQLite is an Open Source        
project, comes with iOS.        

1299
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:29,904
It's not really good for        
everything.                     

1300
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,839
I wouldn't store huge           
things in there.                

1301
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:32,740
It's not really built for       

1302
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,044
that I'll probably put huge     
things in the file system.      

1303
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,980
Even core data when you         
create something big like       

1304
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:41,649
attribute NSData there's        
a switch in there.              

1305
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,552
You can turn on which is store  
this in the external file not   

1306
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,354
actually in the data base.      

1307
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,157
And that's usually worth        
filling if the object is gonna  

1308
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,992
be fairly large.                

1309
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:54,929
The API to use in SQLite        
directly looks like c.          

1310
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:58,834
Not surprisingly it's not       
object oriented in any way      

1311
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:03,338
it's just classic single SQL    
call there's functions that     

1312
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:06,041
you pass SQL language           
to basically.                   

1313
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,178
And it executes it and even     
though core data uses it you    

1314
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:14,216
don't see it from               
core data directly.             

1315
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,985
You know, there's a new         
probably use SQL is             

1316
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,222
if you had some existing        
database or something.          

1317
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,256
The file system,                

1318
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:24,292
now the file system is          
something that I would imagine  

1319
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,228
some of you might want to       
use in your final project.      

1320
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:32,233
And your access to the Unix     
filesystem that underlies       

1321
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:37,238
your application is             
a little bit limited.           

1322
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:41,409
And so the way that you access  
it is generally be used four    

1323
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:42,377
steps.                          

1324
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:47,582
First you're gonna get a URL    
into the Unix filesystem and    

1325
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:50,585
there are about                 
20 preset points                

1326
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:53,288
in the Unix filesystem          
that you can get a URL to.      

1327
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,257
And once you've got that URL,   

1328
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,593
then you can create             
directories there.              

1329
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:02,464
Create files there by taking    
your URL and adding path        

1330
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,134
components to it to describe    
directories and files.          

1331
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,102
Then you write to the files,    

1332
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,573
you're usually doing this       
with the data object.           

1333
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,843
Or there's some property lists  
methods that can write out      

1334
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,778
to a file.                      

1335
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,914
And then finally you're gonna   
manage all those files with     

1336
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,617
a class called a file manager.  

1337
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:23,585
So the file manager             
lets you copy files and         

1338
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,820
remove files and                
list files and directories.     

1339
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,023
And all the things you can      
do with a file system,          

1340
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,323
you do with a file manager.     

1341
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:32,527
So these are the main aspects   
of accessing the file system.   

1342
01:00:32,596 --> 01:00:34,096
So let's look at each           
of these things.                

1343
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,967
It's a Unix filesystem it       
starts at root of course it's   

1344
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,402
protected, there's              
permissions.                    

1345
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,638
So you can't go writing files   
into system directories or      

1346
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:45,206
even reading a lot of           
the system directories.         

1347
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,608
And you certainly               
can't see other apps            

1348
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:48,476
what they're doing over there.  

1349
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:51,646
That's completely               
off limits there.               

1350
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,615
In fact,                        
you can only write and          

1351
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,019
read inside what's called       
your application's sandbox.     

1352
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:02,223
So sandbox is this totally      
segregated part of the file     

1353
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,227
system.                         

1354
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:05,760
do things.                      

1355
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,996
And now why do we               
have a sandbox?                 

1356
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:10,365
It might seem obvious           
to you for some things.         

1357
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,334
For example security            
is a big one.                   

1358
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:16,338
We don't want other apps to be  
able to reach into your app     

1359
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,538
and damage you.                 

1360
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,973
That would be really bad.       

1361
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,775
So we gotta have security for   
that.                           

1362
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,610
There's privacy, we wouldn't    
want those other apps to        

1363
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,447
be able to look inside you and  
see your private data either.   

1364
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,818
But another interesting reason  
that you wouldn't maybe         

1365
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,052
think of is clean up.           

1366
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:35,623
If someone deletes your app     
from their phone entirely they  

1367
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:40,361
want everything this app has    
ever created to be gone.        

1368
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,164
And by having the sandbox, and  
that's the only place you can   

1369
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,934
write, when you delete, it      
deletes your entire sandbox.    

1370
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:48,503
So anything you've              
ever created is gone.           

1371
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:50,405
So you don't have to worry      
about people writing            

1372
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,373
things into system              
directories and all of that.    

1373
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,509
Which happens all over          
the place on the Mac for        

1374
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:57,112
example, you're home directory  
slash library has got           

1375
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,413
all kinds of junk in there.     

1376
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:01,215
They don't have the same        
concept there of everything     

1377
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,185
being isolated like             
you have in iOS.                

1378
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:05,187
So it's actually a cool         
feature have the sandbox.       

1379
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,024
Now inside the sandbox there    
are certain directories that    

1380
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,828
you can get URL too,            
I can says about 20 of them.    

1381
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,829
So for example, there's         
the application directory       

1382
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,632
that's where your               
applications binary is.         

1383
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:21,168
You can only read and In there  
read only, you cannot write     

1384
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,838
to your own application no      
self modifying code allowed,    

1385
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,974
in IOS.                         

1386
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,376
This is also where you          
might have things JPEG's or     

1387
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:31,079
other things if you don't       
use the image assets things.    

1388
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,081
You can actually                
just drag JPEG's or             

1389
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,316
whatever directory              
into your project.              

1390
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:38,619
And they'll appear in you       
application bundle you          

1391
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,522
can look at the directly.       

1392
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,892
We rarely do that, by the way.  

1393
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:46,228
But other URL's that you        
can look in there that          

1394
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,095
are kinda cool.                 

1395
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,530
There's the documents           
directory, that's a big one.    

1396
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,299
That's where you're gonna       
put user created data           

1397
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,535
that the user cares about.      

1398
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,804
What the user perceives         
as their documents.             

1399
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,674
Even if you don't have a        
document oriented application   

1400
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,742
the user considers that as      
like that's their data.         

1401
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,244
That's what they entered.       

1402
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,379
Now you're app might store      
that on the network.            

1403
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,516
So maybe                        

1404
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,553
Or your app is just not the     
kind of app that has data like  

1405
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:12,387
that, fine.                     

1406
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,422
But if it does                  
the documents directory is      

1407
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,591
your primary place you're       
gonna store stuff.              

1408
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,693
But sometimes the user          
creates things and              

1409
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:20,428
you're really just cashing it.  

1410
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:21,162
So for example,                 

1411
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:24,666
let's go back to our            
Twitter client, Smashtag.       

1412
01:03:24,735 --> 01:03:27,735
In Smashtag we                  
downloaded images and           

1413
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,939
maybe we wanted to              
keep the images that            

1414
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:34,809
were associated with            
the image tab local.            

1415
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,010
That way I'm local even         

1416
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,113
though I'm not connected        
to the network.                 

1417
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,115
But those aren't really user    
data their just something I     

1418
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,217
wanna cache.                    

1419
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,687
I just want to keep them        
local so for ease of use.       

1420
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:47,589
But as things go                
out of recent,                  

1421
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,524
I'd probably clear them out.    

1422
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,694
And if that cache directory     
got completely cleared out it   

1423
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,497
would be fine I'd just          
reload them all again.          

1424
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,065
So the caches                   
directory is a place            

1425
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,967
to put stuff that you           
can easily get again.           

1426
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,904
Images and                      
stuff that you're caching.      

1427
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:05,373
And there's a bunch             
of other directories.           

1428
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,141
I don't have time to            
talk about all of them,         

1429
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,809
unfortunately.                  

1430
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,045
So how do we get our URL        
to one of these special         

1431
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:13,181
directories like                
the document structure or       

1432
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,516
the caches directory,           
things like that?               

1433
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,086
We're gonna use this            
another default,                

1434
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:21,355
just like we had in in this     
notification center.default.    

1435
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,625
Now we have                     
FileManager.default.            

1436
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:26,261
So the FileManager is           
the thing that lets you         

1437
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,595
manage the entire file system,  
and                             

1438
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:30,398
it has a default one            
that you can use.               

1439
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:33,668
And it has a method             
called URLs for                 

1440
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:36,637
directory in domainMask, okay.  

1441
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,540
That's this method              
you see right here.             

1442
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,275
And it gives you                
an array of URLs.               

1443
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:45,146
In iOS, there's only            
ever one URL in there.          

1444
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,816
The reason this is an array on  
desktop machines like the Mac,  

1445
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,854
sometimes you'll have like      
a library directory that has    

1446
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,155
one for the user,               
one on the network so           

1447
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,157
there's multiple of them.       

1448
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,760
But in iOS all things           
are inside the sandbox so       

1449
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,765
the only domain, that's why     
the user domain mask there is   

1450
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,866
user domain mask.               

1451
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,701
So there's only ever one URL.   

1452
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,804
So there's only one URL for     
your documents directory.       

1453
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,405
One URL for                     
your caches directory.          

1454
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,841
One URL for                     
your documentation directory.   

1455
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,977
One URL for your application,   
okay, just one.                 

1456
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:18,546
Just the one in the sandbox.    

1457
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,882
So you specify which            
directory you want with that    

1458
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,051
argument therefore directory.   

1459
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,386
And that has to be a type       

1460
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:27,622
FileManager.SearchPathDirect-   
ory.                            

1461
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,691
So again, look that up          
in the documentation and        

1462
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,694
you'll see the various          
directories in your sandbox     

1463
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,394
that you can look at.           

1464
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,130
There's about 20 of them.       

1465
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:37,031
And if you are the document     
director for example,           

1466
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,700
you say .documentDirectory      
right there.                    

1467
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,203
And it will give you back an    
array where there is only one   

1468
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:47,008
thing in there.                 

1469
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,777
document directory              
in your sandbox.                

1470
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:50,445
Make sense?                     

1471
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,647
So that's how we get in.        

1472
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,585
Once we get in, we want to      
create directories in there,    

1473
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:59,386
create files, whatever.         

1474
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,122
We, or access files.            

1475
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:05,292
We do those by using these      
appending methods in URL.       

1476
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,929
So we have that URL and         
we send a message to the URL.   

1477
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:12,233
Like give me a new URL by       
URL appendingPathComponent      

1478
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,869
whatever the name of my         
directory or the name of        

1479
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:18,006
the file that I want or by      
appending path extension, so    

1480
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,743
.jpeg, or something like that,  
so I can get my jpeg file.      

1481
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,645
So by doing that I              
build a path, the URL,          

1482
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,647
to the file I want.             

1483
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,917
So that's how I navigate        
around in my sand box.          

1484
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,920
So now I have the URL and       

1485
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:35,156
I can do a lot of               
things with that URL.           

1486
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:37,992
I'll show you in a moment how   
you can write files out and     

1487
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:40,928
things like that but you can    
also find out about things URL  

1488
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,664
like is this a file?            

1489
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,565
Or is it a directory?           

1490
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,133
Or is it on the network for     
example?                        

1491
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,102
Cuz you have a URL              
that someone gives you,         

1492
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,203
maybe it's a network URL.       

1493
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,472
Http, colon, slash,             
slash, something.               

1494
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:55,109
Well that's not a file URL so   
is file, file URL right there,  

1495
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,778
we tell you that it's           
in the file system.             

1496
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,983
A really powerful method in     
URL is resourceValues for       

1497
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,017
keys.                           

1498
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:06,287
So resource values for keys     
you give it an array of keys    

1499
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,422
that are attributes of files,   

1500
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,392
these keys are attributes of    
files, like the files size, or  

1501
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:13,794
the files creation date,        
or whatever.                    

1502
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,331
And it will return you a        
dictionary with those keys and  

1503
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,200
the values for the file, for    

1504
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,801
the URL that you're             
pointing to.                    

1505
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,503
So that's how you can find      
out the size of the file,       

1506
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,406
where the creationDate or       
whether isDirectory.            

1507
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,441
Things like that.               

1508
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,343
Notice the listing throws so    
be careful here.                

1509
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:30,712
You have to do this in a try.   

1510
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:36,617
How about writing files         
out to the file system.         

1511
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:39,586
Well mostly we do               
this with a data.               

1512
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,724
If you have for                 
example a UI image and          

1513
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,492
you wanna store on              
your screen, or                 

1514
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,293
whatever that you downloaded    
from the internet, and          

1515
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,963
you wanna store that            
into the file system,           

1516
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,766
there's actually a cool         
function called, I think,       

1517
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:55,502
UI image jpeg representation    
or something like that.         

1518
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,006
And you give it a UI image,     
and it will return a data.      

1519
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,443
And a data will have            
the data of the jpeg image.     

1520
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:03,244
That you can store.             

1521
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,913
And then you can                
say write to url.               

1522
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,584
So this is a data method here   
write to URL atomically.        

1523
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,519
And then we'll write            
it out to that URL.             

1524
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,954
So you have to build yourself   
URL like get in the sandbox     

1525
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,657
directory, and then depending   
whatever name you want to it.   

1526
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,227
Then you say write to URL,      
atomically just means it'll     

1527
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:21,362
safely, it'll write it          
to a temp file first and        

1528
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,031
then swap it in so              
if you ran out of disk space    

1529
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,734
while writing it or something   
it wouldn't corrupt if a file   

1530
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,403
that was already there for      
example.                        

1531
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:33,541
Now, to get the data object     
back you just use the same      

1532
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:38,345
initializer you used when       
we did some hashtag or          

1533
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,648
the lecture before that,        

1534
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,551
what we said data init,         
contents of URL.                

1535
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,352
Now in that case,               

1536
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:47,421
if the URL was a network URL    
and it blocked the main queue,  

1537
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,758
here that URL could             
be a file system URL.           

1538
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,960
And it wouldn't block           
the main queue.                 

1539
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:55,262
Loading files up super fast.    

1540
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,866
So you don't really need        
to do that in a separate        

1541
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,101
thread unless maybe it          
was a gigantic file.            

1542
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,304
But even then, maybe you        
could do that, yeah question.   

1543
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:07,041
When would you not wanna        
do atomically right here?       

1544
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,876
It's hard for me to even think  
of an example with that.        

1545
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,579
Maybe it's a really             
huge file and                   

1546
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,381
you don't wanna create          
two copies of it.               

1547
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,516
The safe copy and               
then over, and so               

1548
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:18,686
you've got an existing copy     
of a huge file, let's say.      

1549
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,655
And you don't wanna             
create another copy of it       

1550
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,758
as a safe copy before           
you move it in, so,             

1551
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,293
that you might say              
atomically no so,               

1552
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,863
it just destroys your old one   
right off of that, I mean,      

1553
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,597
I'm really stretching to        
think of good example,          

1554
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,768
you almost always               
want true to there.             

1555
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,904
So, that's how you read and     
write files with data,          

1556
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,539
very common way to do that.     

1557
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,709
Once you've written out files,  
you want to be able to go       

1558
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,946
through your file system and    
like look at what files are in  

1559
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:47,381
certain directories or          
things like that.               

1560
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,484
Maybe you've got                
caches out there and            

1561
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,953
you want to see what's in       
your cache or whatever.         

1562
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,488
And that's what                 
FileManager's for.              

1563
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,590
It has dozens of methods for    
doing that like,                

1564
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,994
createDirectory( at url, which  
will create a directory for     

1565
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,396
you so                          
you can put files in there.     

1566
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:06,433
And it also has a bunch,        
it has a delegate.              

1567
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,403
And a bunch of shoulds.         

1568
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:11,372
Should I allow                  
creating this file?             

1569
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:14,341
Things like that.               

1570
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,813
The FileManager by the way is   
thread safe in the same way     

1571
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,916
that an NSManagedObjectContext  
is thread safe.                 

1572
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:25,552
In other words, if you create   
the FileManager on a certain    

1573
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:29,389
thread then it's always thread  
safe to use it in that thread,  

1574
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,959
in that same queue.             

1575
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:34,661
If you create a FileManager     
on a different one,             

1576
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,231
that one's safe to              
use in its queue and            

1577
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,901
they will work                  
together as well.               

1578
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:43,004
Just don't try to use           
a FileManager created in one    

1579
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,638
thread over on                  
a different thread.             

1580
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:45,974
That is not thread safe.        

1581
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:51,712
It's just like how              
NSManagedObjectContext is       

1582
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,581
thread safe.                    

1583
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,951
That is it for this lecture so  
the coming up we have           

1584
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,387
is accessibility is our         
next lecture on Monday and      

1585
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:04,491
also your slides are due for    
the alternate final there.      

1586
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,193
Do not forget that.             

1587
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,027
I put it in red.                

1588
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:10,698
How many people,                

1589
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,902
A few of you, so make sure      
you get your slides in.         

1590
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:17,671
Wednesday will be               
the alternate final itself.     

1591
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,674
Your final project is due       
the Sunday after that,          

1592
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,645
the Sunday the 19th of March,   
at midnight.                    

1593
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,613
That is it.                     

1594
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,517
I will see you all on Monday.   

1595
