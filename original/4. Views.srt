00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,372
Stanford University.            

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,075
>> All right, well,             
welcome to Stanford CS193P,     

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,714
that's Developing Applications  
for iOS, winter of 2017.        

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:20,785
So today, our topic is to talk  
about custom views, okay,       

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,123
specifically the drawing        
side of having custom views.    

7
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,193
And this is gonna be a more     
typical lecture than last       

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,762
time because I'll be            
doing some slides and           

9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,964
explaining the concepts         
to you, and                     

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,301
then I'll go into a demo that   
shows you how we do it all.     

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,104
So what is a view?              

12
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,540
A view is a subclass            
of UIView,                      

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,643
which is in UIKit in iOS.       

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,313
And all it does                 
is carve out or                 

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,883
represent a rectangular         
area on screen.                 

16
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,019
And that rectangular area       
defines a coordinate space      

17
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,990
that we're gonna draw in and    
that we're gonna get            

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,124
multi-touch events              
like pinches and                

19
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,660
swipes and all that stuff.      

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,095
So today,                       

21
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,131
I'm just gonna focus on the     
drawing side of that all and    

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,268
then we'll start talking about  
the gestures on Wednesday.      

23
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,439
So these views,                 
these little rectangle areas    

24
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,542
are put on screen in            
this hierarchical way.          

25
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,779
And that just means that        
the views have subviews         

26
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:21,913
inside of them.                 

27
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,450
Now any given view can          
only have one superview,        

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,185
that's the view that            
it's contained in.              

29
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,054
But it can have any             
number of subviews,             

30
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,689
so views made out of it.        

31
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,324
So for example,                 
on the calculator, we had for   

32
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,493
example, stack view, okay.      

33
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,195
It had a lot of subviews,       

34
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,897
all the buttons that            
we stacked in it.               

35
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,400
In fact, some of the stack      
views had other stack views as  

36
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,067
their subviews.                 

37
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,302
And then those stack            
views had more subviews,        

38
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,771
which were buttons or           
whatever, okay.                 

39
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,674
So that's how we build our      
UI is this hierarchical         

40
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,077
collection of these             
rectangular areas.              

41
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,014
Now, at the very, very, very    
top there's a special UIView    

42
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,751
called UIWindow class, we       
don't deal with that in iOS.    

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,021
In fact, the only time you      
would ever do anything with     

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,491
the UIWindow is if you were     
building an app that maybe      

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,193
projected to a projector.       

46
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,328
So that you had two screens,    
your device and                 

47
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,963
then maybe some                 
external projector or           

48
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,199
something, then you might       
care about UIWindow.            

49
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,069
But otherwise,                  
it's all about UIView, okay?    

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,871
All of our arrangement of       
the screen is all about how we  

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,574
arrange the UIViews.            

52
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,444
Now this hierarchy, okay,       
these rectangular areas inside  

53
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,680
of rectangular areas,           
is almost always built          

54
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,316
in Interface Builder,           
inside Xcode, okay?             

55
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,817
That's how we built             
the stack view stuff.           

56
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,752
We dragged out a bunch          
of buttons and                  

57
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,920
then we selected them and       
said,                           

58
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,890
"Embed in Stack View." Well,    
that wrapped it in there.       

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,094
But we can also build that      
hierarchy by dragging views     

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,929
out of the utilities,           

61
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,132
bottom of the utilities window  
there, inside other views.      

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,132
So you can drag,                

63
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,703
do it by dragging-dropping      
inside of other views.          

64
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,338
It is possible to               
do it in code but               

65
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,207
usually we're doing             
it graphically.                 

66
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,375
If you're doing it in code,     

67
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:00,912
the two main methods            
involved in building and        

68
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:05,050
destroying this hierarchy,      
are addSubview, okay,           

69
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,418
addSubview, takes               
a view as an argument.          

70
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,489
You send it to the              
"soon-to-be" superview of that  

71
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,708
In other words,                 
you ask another view,           

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:13,859
view.                           

73
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,928
please add this other view      
as subview of yourself.         

74
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,864
Now when you're doing the       
opposite, taking some view out  

75
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,467
of the hierarchy, you don't     
send it to the superview.       

76
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,436
You send it to                  
the actual view itself,         

77
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,305
basically remove yourself       
from this view hierarchy.       

78
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,507
So you send                     
removeFromSuperview             

79
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,977
to the actual view              
you want removed.               

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,347
Now where does this             
hierarchy start?                

81
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,048
I guess you could say           
it starts in UIWindow.          

82
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,517
But for our purposes, we don't  
even pay attention to that.     

83
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,054
It starts at                    
the top level view              

84
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,956
in that scene in                
Interface Builder.              

85
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,225
The scene that's controlled by  
our view controller, right?     

86
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,527
That rectangular area           
that we work in.                

87
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,261
There's a top,                  

88
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,499
top level view that covers      
the whole space up there.       

89
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,701
And there is an important       
instance variable,              

90
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,771
property, in UIViewController.  

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,907
Okay, so all subclasses         
of UIViewController get         

92
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,842
this property.                  

93
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,946
It's called view and it's       
a UIView and a top level view.  

94
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:12,084
And it's very important to      
understand that in an MVC,      

95
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,520
the controller has this,        
always has this var which       

96
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,459
points to the very top of that  
view hierarchy in its scene.    

97
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,430
This top level view is          
important because for example,  

98
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,599
when you rotate, it's the       
thing whose bounds changes,     

99
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,801
that top level view.            

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,336
And you're gonna learn          
a little later that when        

101
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,606
the bounds of a view changes,   
there's a mechanism for         

102
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,043
offering all of its subviews    
an opportunity to change.       

103
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,712
So that's why when              
we rotate device,               

104
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,281
that top level view changes     
from being tall and             

105
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,085
thin to being wide and          
less tall.                      

106
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,654
And that causes all             
those stack views and           

107
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,123
everything else to start        
getting resized as well,        

108
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,361
because they're all subviews    
of this top level view, okay?   

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,497
If you were going to add        
views to the view hierarchy     

110
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,866
programmatically rather         
than dragging and               

111
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,502
dropping them, then you would   
need this view because it's     

112
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,204
the top of the entire           
view hierarchy.                 

113
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,606
And you would kinda             
work your way down              

114
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,907
to find out where you           
want to put that view.          

115
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,410
But we don't otherwise          
actually look at this view      

116
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,846
much because we usually         
have outlets, rights?           

117
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,982
IBOutlets--like the display     
that points to the label--that  

118
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,484
gives us access to that label.  

119
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,451
That's all we want, so          

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,988
we don't have to go looking     
at the top level view and       

121
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,290
looking all down the views,     
okay?                           

122
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,059
So this is important            
to know about but               

123
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,896
surprisingly you don't          
access it that much, okay.      

124
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,764
This view is automatically      
hooked up for you in            

125
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,967
Interface Builder when you      
drag out a View Controller.     

126
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,002
It's just all                   
magically hooked up,            

127
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,071
you don't have to               
worry about that.               

128
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,241
Okay, let's talk about          
initialization of the UIView.   

129
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,378
As usual, when you saw          
the lecture from last time,     

130
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,981
you probably realize, whoa,     
initialization has a lot of     

131
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,152
caveats when you're talking     
about initializing a class,     

132
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,170
Remember all those rules        
I was going through?            

133
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:56,121
right?                          

134
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,224
Required convenience and its    
inheritance, all this stuff.    

135
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,960
So we try to avoid              
initializers generally as much  

136
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,963
as we can by doing all          
the things I talked             

137
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,932
about on Wednesday,             
like setting things equal or    

138
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,501
even using lazy or              
something like that.            

139
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,170
But if you can't avoid it,      

140
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,873
UIView has an interesting       
initializer situation.          

141
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:19,343
It has two initializers         
that you have to deal with.     

142
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,513
Okay, one of them, init, with   
the frame is the argument, is   

143
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,549
the one that you would call if  
you're trying to create a view  

144
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:30,155
in code, which you'll probably  
never do in this class, okay?   

145
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,555
Because you're                  
always gonna use or             

146
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,425
do it in Interface Builder      
with Xcode.                     

147
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,261
But, so that's the kind         
of in-code one.                 

148
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,097
And init with                   
this coder thing,               

149
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,566
which I'll talk about           
right at the end of class,      

150
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,302
but it's not important          
to know early on.               

151
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,371
That's the init that gets       
called when your stuff come     

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,874
outs of Interface Builder,      
right?                          

153
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,377
When it comes from,             
when you built in Xcode.        

154
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,312
All the stuff that you're       
building in Interface Builder   

155
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,214
essentially gets coded,         

156
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,383
that's what this coder          
business is about.              

157
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,553
Gets coded into an XML file,    
kind of freeze dried.           

158
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,323
And then when you run your      
program, that XML file gets     

159
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,591
loaded in and it's kind         
of the instructions for         

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,929
how to create all               
those objects, okay?            

161
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,864
And init with coder is          
the initializer it uses         

162
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,232
to recreate the view.           

163
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,402
So if you have any code that    
needs to go in an initializer,  

164
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,804
like you need to initialize     
some var in your UIView,        

165
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,806
you have to do it like this.    

166
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,741
Override both of these inits,   

167
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,911
one of them is a required       
init, the coder one.            

168
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,780
And we create some other        
method like this green setup    

169
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,615
method I have.                  

170
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,118
And just call that method       
from both of them.              

171
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,653
That way you're guaranteed      
that whether your custom view   

172
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,156
is created in code or           
created in Interface Builder,   

173
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:43,694
it will get                     
initialized properly.           

174
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,697
If you have vars that have to   
be initialized, you may not be  

175
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,501
able to use this mechanism      
of course because you can't     

176
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,337
call methods in yourself        
until you're initialized.       

177
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,706
So you might have to have       
that var initialization be      

178
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,142
somewhat duplicated there.      

179
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,978
There's another alternative to  
initialization though and this  

180
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,514
is for any other object that    
comes out of Interface Builder  

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
which is called awakeFromNib.   

182
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,018
Okay, awakeFromNib.             

183
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,554
This is sent to every single    
object that ever comes out      

184
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,491
of Interface Builder file,      
okay, that you edit             

185
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,125
in the story board there        
including views and             

186
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,426
your View Controller for        
that matter.                    

187
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,664
And so                          

188
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,634
the "Your object must be        
completely initialized."        

189
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,271
Those restrictions are not      
satisfied by this.              

190
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,940
But still you can put code in   
there, you get, get going.      

191
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,475
And we're gonna learn           
all kinds of ways to do         

192
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,944
initialization throughout       
our system down the road,       

193
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,514
but that's basically how        
you initialize UIViews.         

194
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,085
Okay so we're gonna             
talk now about UIView           

195
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,287
as this rectangular area        
in which we're gonna draw.      

196
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,256
And so to do that we need       
talk about some types.          

197
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,492
They're some very important     
types that you need to know.    

198
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,627
One of them is CGFloat.         

199
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,796
So CGFloat is                   
a floating point value.         

200
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,665
All of your coordinates that    
you're gonna be drawing in      

201
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,668
are all floating point values,  
but they're not doubles,        

202
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,238
they're not floats,             
they're CGFloats.               

203
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,206
So this is a type,              

204
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,142
a real type that you            
have to use all the time        

205
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,378
when you're doing anything      
with the drawing, okay?         

206
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,947
CG stands for Core Graphics,    

207
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,916
this is the "graphics           
float" right here, okay?        

208
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,553
There's also a CGPoint which    
is just a struct with two       

209
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,956
things in it, x and y,          
they're both CGFloats, CGPoint  

210
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,993
represents a point in your      
coordinate system somewhere.    

211
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,395
Again, floating                 
point coordinates.              

212
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,465
There's also CGSize,            
which represents an extent.     

213
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,134
You know, a width and           
a height, okay?                 

214
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,370
Only, it's just the struct,     
with two CGFloats, width and    

215
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,805
height, simple.                 

216
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,775
And there's CGRect, of course,  
which is a rectangle.           

217
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,844
It's a struct that has an       
origin, which is CGPoint, and   

218
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,445
an extent, which is a size.     

219
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,282
So a rectangle                  
represents a size, okay?        

220
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,585
So creating a CGRect--there's   
actually quite a few            

221
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,953
initializers for it.            

222
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,087
You can create an origin and    
size,                           

223
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,490
you can do an x y with height,  
things like that.               

224
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,792
And CGRect also has             
a lot of really cool,           

225
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:59,630
little convenience vars and     
funcs and thing like that.      

226
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,399
maxY, midY, those'll tell you   
thing like where's the left     

227
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,100
Like minX,                      

228
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,370
edge of your rect to the top    
to the left or the bottom.      

229
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,239
The middle points, etc.         

230
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,976
There's also nice functions     
like intersects other rect      

231
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,846
will return whether the two     
rectangles cross over.          

232
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:18,182
And there's even                
contains whether a point        

233
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,351
is inside the rectangle, etc.   

234
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,253
So there's quite                
a few of these.                 

235
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,587
I can't put them all            
on the slide, so                

236
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,024
you're gonna wanna familiarize  
yourselves with CGRect.         

237
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,827
Because it probably has a lot   
of things in there that         

238
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,162
you would otherwise be          
writing your own code to do.    

239
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,164
Okay, so                        
now that we have those types,   

240
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,734
those four types, we can start  
talking about this coordinate   

241
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,104
system that we're gonna         
be doing our drawing in.        

242
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,805
Now, the most important         
thing to understand,            

243
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,808
the simplest thing, is that     
the origin of this coordinate   

244
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,211
system is in the upper          
left of the screen.             

245
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,481
It's not Cartesian coordinates  
which the origin would be in    

246
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,716
the lower left of the screen    
because in Cartesian            

247
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,986
coordinates increasing          
y means up, but                 

248
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,255
in this coordinate system       
increasing y means going down,  

249
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,156
down the screen, okay?          

250
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,625
So very important               
to understand that.             

251
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:06,063
So you can see that point I     
have up there, 500,35 that's    

252
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:11,302
500 over and 35 down from       
the origin upper left, okay?    

253
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,874
Now, the units in here that     
we're drawing are points.       

254
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,043
Okay, be very careful that      
you understand the unit         

255
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,245
terminology here, okay?         

256
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,281
It's in points, not pixels.     

257
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,784
A pixel is like the smallest    
possible little light           

258
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,120
that can be turned              
on on your screen.              

259
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,023
Okay, now some devices          
have a lot of pixels            

260
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,394
per point--they're very dense.  

261
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,030
And that's really great,        
because if you're drawing       

262
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,899
smooth curves--like             
fonts are just                  

263
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,568
smooth curves being drawn--you  
don't get jaggy edges,          

264
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,204
because there's so              
many tiny little points, okay?  

265
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,308
But we can't make it, so that   
we draw in the pixel space,     

266
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:54,111
otherwise, on a very            
dense pixel screen,             

267
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,980
our image would                 
be really small.                

268
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,815
And then, in an undense one,    
it'd be really big,             

269
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,217
because the pixels              
are really big.                 

270
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,419
So we instead of                
drawing in pixels,              

271
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,154
we draw in points, okay?        

272
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,757
This is the same point by       
the way that is like the point  

273
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,558
size of a font.                 

274
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:11,162
A 12 point font, same word      
there, same point, okay?        

275
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,601
So, you can find out though     
how many pixels there are per   

276
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,304
point, in other words how high  
resolution your screen is,      

277
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:23,508
with this var in UIView         
called contentScaleFactor.      

278
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,710
It's a CGFloat, it's either     
gonna be one, two, or           

279
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,044
three currently.                

280
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,480
Like, the iPhone                
7 Plus is three.                

281
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,216
Three pixels per point          
in each direction.              

282
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:37,088
And the older like              
iPhone 4s maybe?                

283
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,457
Maybe all the way back          
to the 4 would be one.          

284
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,193
Okay, some of the older         
iPads would be one.             

285
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,495
The newer iPads would be two.   

286
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,863
So, If you're doing anything    
where you have to pay           

287
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,164
Okay?                           

288
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,033
attention to the number         
of pixels of points,            

289
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,167
this is what you need.          

290
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,770
Now the great thing is, most    
of the time you don't care      

291
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,773
because when you're using       
iOS to draw with a font,        

292
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,642
it's automatically gonna        
do super smooth turns, and      

293
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,978
you don't even have to know     
what the scale factor is.       

294
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,846
Even if you're just             
drawing an arc,                 

295
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,083
it'll make sure you do as       
little jaggies as possible.     

296
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,785
So, you rarely                  
have to know this.              

297
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,753
But actually, wake up.          

298
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,355
You do need to know for         
assignment three, okay?         

299
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,857
So assignment three,            
you will have to know this.     

300
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,027
Alright, now.                   

301
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,965
The most important var in all   
of UIView is this one: bounds.  

302
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,135
And even in that                
really important var,           

303
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,273
really what you care            
about is the size.              

304
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,576
This is, in your drawing        
coordinate system,              

305
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,378
the space you have to draw in.  

306
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,515
This is basically the size of   
your view in your own drawing   

307
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,683
coordinate system.              

308
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,818
So any time you're              
doing any drawing and           

309
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,688
you wanna draw something        
that's as wide as your view,    

310
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,223
you're gonna use                
bounds.size.width here.         

311
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,560
And you're almost always gonna  
have your bounds' origin be     

312
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,897
(0, 0) so if you want put       
something in upper left you're  

313
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,200
gonna put it at (0,             
0) or close to (0, 0).          

314
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,334
So this rect, bounds,           

315
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,336
is describing the area          
have to draw in.                

316
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,839
Now it's important because      
you obviously want to,          

317
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,142
depending on your size,         
draw yourself appropriately.    

318
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,812
And it's also important         
because there are two other     

319
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,016
vars that often get confused    
by students with bounds, and    

320
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,920
which are quite different:      
that is frame and center.       

321
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,825
So frame and                    
center have nothing to do       

322
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,994
with where you're drawing,      
that's bounds.                  

323
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,665
Frame and center is where       
you are in your super view.     

324
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,136
So here's a picture of          
that frame and center.          

325
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,473
So center is where your         
center is in your superview's   

326
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,309
coordinate system and frame is  
a rectangle that completely     

327
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,612
encases you in your             
superview's coordinate system.  

328
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,515
And you might think, well the   
size of my frame is gonna be    

329
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,752
exactly the same size as        
my bounds size, right?          

330
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:53,157
And the answer is no,           
because views can be rotated.   

331
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,194
And if you have ever rotated    
a view like this green one,     

332
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,962
Inside the code that's drawing  
in View B, its bounds just      

333
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,663
View B.                         

334
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,933
looks like a normal rectangle,  
the fact that it's rotated,     

335
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,934
it doesn't even                 
know it's rotated.              

336
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,637
But if you look at the center   
of it, or if you look at        

337
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,574
the frame that encloses it,     
look, it's not the same size.   

338
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,193
It has to be bigger because,    
to the superview, View A,       

339
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:13,744
It's bigger.                    

340
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,547
View B kinda looks              
like a diamond, right?          

341
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,915
So it has to be bigger.         

342
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:22,920
So the bottom line here, never  
use frame or center to draw.    

343
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,923
Frame and center are only       
used to position you            

344
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:26,557
in your super view.             

345
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,126
Okay, you can use either one.   

346
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,794
If you set the center,          
it'll move the frame,           

347
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,896
if you set the frame,           
it'll adjust the center, okay.  

348
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:32,764
They're tied together.          

349
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,699
Okay.                           

350
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,735
How do we create views?         

351
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,336
Okay, because I already told    
you we don't really use         

352
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,571
the initializer,                
we don't, you know,             

353
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,406
create them in code very much.  

354
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,474
What we usually do              
is we drag them out             

355
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,474
Okay?                           

356
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,411
from the Object Palette in the  
bottom of the utilities window  

357
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,013
in Interface Builder.           

358
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,316
But if I built a custom view,   
Paul's view or                  

359
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:56,420
something, it's not going       
to be in the palette, okay.     

360
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,556
Xcode didn't ship with          
my view in the palette.         

361
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,491
So instead, there's a generic   
view, just plain UIView, and    

362
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,594
you're gonna drag that in.      

363
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,696
But then, you're gonna inspect  
it using the top half of        

364
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,298
the utilities pane              
on the right, right?            

365
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,200
You're gonna inspect it and     

366
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,568
change its class                
to not be UIView.               

367
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,272
It's gonna be your subclass     
of UIView, so Paul view or      

368
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,673
whatever, okay?                 

369
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,374
And this is a very              
important step to remember.     

370
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,977
When you create a custom view   
and you drag it into your UI,   

371
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,346
you have to change its class    
to be your custom class.        

372
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,615
And we'll see that in           
the demo, how it works.         

373
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,385
When you create it in code,     
of course,                      

374
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,319
you're just doing               
UIView(frame:),                 

375
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,888
and you provide the frame,      
okay?                           

376
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,357
And that frame, remember,       
what does it describe?          

377
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,826
Describes where this view is    
gonna be in its super view      

378
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,097
when it gets added, that's      
all the frame is doing, okay?   

379
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,232
And you can create it with      
UIView(), no arguments.         

380
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,234
Then it will be zero width,     
zero height, and                

381
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,903
it'll be at zero, zero, so      
you won't even see it, so.      

382
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,070
But you could come              
along later and                 

383
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,508
change its frame and/or its     
center to move it around.       

384
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,210
Here, it's a really             
quick example,                  

385
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,245
how to create a view in code.   

386
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,413
I'm gonna create a UILabel.     

387
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,283
UILabel is just                 
a subclass of UIView.           

388
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,719
And notice that on              
the second line there,          

389
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,255
I'm just saying label =         
UILabel(frame:) of whatever.    

390
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,992
So I'm giving it this frame,    
20, 20, 150, right?             

391
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,427
And then I'm setting            
the text to "Hello".            

392
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,497
Well, if I was doing this       
code in a UIViewController,     

393
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,866
then I could put it at          
that top level view,            

394
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,769
it'd look like that,            
view.addSubview, okay?          

395
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,438
And it would add the subview.   

396
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,540
Custom views, so why do I       
ever need a custom view?        

397
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,410
Either I need to do             
custom drawing or               

398
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,479
I need to do custom             
multi-touch input, okay?        

399
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,480
Those are the reasons           

400
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,682
that you're gonna               
create a custom view.           

401
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,284
And so we're gonna focus        
on the drawing, and             

402
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,754
the drawing is very,            
very simple, okay?              

403
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,556
There's this one method         
that's called draw.             

404
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,626
And it takes one argument,      
which is a rect.                

405
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,062
For historical reasons,         
we sometimes call it drawrect,  

406
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,165
but it's not actually           
called drawrect anymore.        

407
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,001
It's called draw, and           
the argument is called rect.    

408
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,907
And this draw is gonna be       
sent to you by the system.      

409
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,742
It's sent to your               
UIView subclass,                

410
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,345
you override it, and it gets    
sent to you by the system when  

411
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,447
the system wants you            
to draw yourself.               

412
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,450
This is the only way you        
can draw in your view,          

413
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,019
is to be asked by               
the system to draw.             

414
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,524
There is no other               
way to draw in iOS.             

415
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,793
So what's that                  
rectangle about?                

416
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,462
That rectangle is some          
sub-area in your bounds         

417
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,930
that it wants you to draw.      

418
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,533
Now, that's a performance       
enhancement, because you can    

419
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,269
ignore that and draw your       
whole view, if you'd like.      

420
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,438
But like in your assignment     
three, you're probably gonna    

421
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,106
wanna pay attention to          
this rectangle because          

422
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,510
your assignment three's draw    
is gonna be pretty expensive,   

423
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,846
so you wanna draw as            
little as possible.             

424
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,914
So that's what this draw is,    
very simple,                    

425
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,117
it's just called by the         
system, time for you to draw.   

426
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,385
It's the only way to draw.      

427
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,855
So it's really,                 
really easy to understand.      

428
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,325
Never call this method, ever.   

429
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,827
If you ever call this method,   
it's wrong.                     

430
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,895
The system calls this method,   

431
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,198
the system's the only one       
who calls this method.          

432
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,233
So what happens if              
you need to draw?               

433
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,468
Something changed,              
and you wanna redraw.           

434
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,638
You call one of these two       
methods, setNeedsDisplay or     

435
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,873
setNeedsDisplay with            
the argument of a rect.         

436
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,309
And that's telling the system,  
hey, system,                    

437
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,744
my view needs to be redrawn.    

438
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,212
Please ask me to redraw it.     

439
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,247
And at some appropriate         
time in the future,             

440
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,915
it will ask you to redraw it.   

441
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,218
But it knows better than you    
when the best time to draw is,  

442
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,486
believe me.                     

443
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,721
And the rect that you can       
pass, that's just the rect      

444
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,723
that's gonna be passed          
onto your draw.                 

445
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,426
So setNeedsDisplay with         
a rect is like an optimized     

446
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,494
setNeedsDisplay.                

447
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,695
It's like,                      
I need to be redrawn, but       

448
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,596
only this part of me.           

449
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:30,701
And you can send this to any    
UIView, say, redraw this view.  

450
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,069
Usually, views send it to       
themselves though because       

451
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,774
they're the ones who know best  
when they need to be redrawn,   

452
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,441
okay?                           

453
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,643
Alright.                        

454
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:43,580
So, how do I implement          
this drawrect,                  

455
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,352
draw, draw with                 
a CGRect argument guy?          

456
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,554
And the answer is,              
you're gonna do it with paths.  

457
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,057
You're gonna create paths, and  
then you're going to stroke     

458
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,161
them and fill them to make      
shapes and things like that.    

459
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,097
And then you're also gonna      
use text and images.            

460
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,134
So that's the primary way       
that you're going to draw       

461
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,167
in there, okay?                 

462
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,103
So we'll talk about text and    
images in a minute.             

463
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,171
Let's talk about the drawing    
with the paths first.           

464
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,473
There's really two              
ways to do it.                  

465
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,442
One is, you can get             
what's called a context,        

466
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,010
a drawing context, and          
I'll show you how to get it.    

467
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,547
And then you can send messages  
to that context like, move to   

468
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,718
this point, draw a line to      
here, add an arc over here,     

469
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,655
put some text over here,        
things like that, okay?         

470
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,256
Actually, the text we're        
gonna do in a different way,    

471
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,892
but, so that's one way.         

472
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,028
And then the other way is,      
you can create a path object,   

473
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,798
okay, using UIBezierPath, and   
it's the same kind of thing.    

474
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,067
But you're gonna create this    
object that you're gonna tell   

475
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,403
that object, okay, I want this  
path to be moving to here, and  

476
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,438
then a line here, and then      
an arc over to here, okay?      

477
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,606
So you create this path, and    

478
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,709
then you send a message to      
that path saying, okay,         

479
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,810
stroke it.                      

480
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,744
So it's a subtle difference,    
but you'll see.                 

481
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,880
We're gonna focus mainly        
on the UIBezierPath way,        

482
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,415
because it's kind of            
a little simpler.               

483
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,517
So let's understand             
the concepts here of            

484
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,153
Core Graphics, that's what the  
CG is that you're seeing in     

485
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,020
all the places here.            

486
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,224
And the number one thing        
about Core Graphics is,         

487
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,391
we need a context.              

488
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,927
And that context might be a     
drawing context for on-screen,  

489
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,062
it might be a printing          
context if we're printing,      

490
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,999
might be a context of drawing   
to an off-screen bitmap, etc.   

491
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,236
The one you care about is       
obviously the context to        

492
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,937
draw in your drawrect.          

493
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,539
And you get that by             
calling this function.          

494
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,573
This is just a Swift function,  

495
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,975
it's not on a class or          
anything.                       

496
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,511
UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(),  
and                             

497
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,847
that's going to get you         
a context that you can then     

498
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,618
tell it to create a path by     
moving and all that stuff.      

499
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,387
Which is what you do then,      
you create these paths out of   

500
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,623
lines and arcs and              
things like that.               

501
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,359
Then you set drawing            
attributes in the context,      

502
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,962
like the colors you wanna use,  
the fonts if you're doing       

503
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,432
text, line widths,              
those kinds of things.          

504
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,300
You set those all up, and       
then you stroke and fill.       

505
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,801
And that's it, stroking and     

506
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,804
filling are actually the only   
two directives that actually    

507
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,740
cause something to              
happen on screen.               

508
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,574
But keep in mind that, like,    

509
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:55,279
a font is basically just a      
really exquisite path filled,   

510
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,614
okay, or stroked and filled.    

511
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,884
So you can do a lot with        
stroking and filling.           

512
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,420
So UIBezierPath kinda           
encapsulates all of those       

513
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,956
Core Graphics concepts          
into an object.                 

514
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,525
And so I have an example here   
to show you how I would use     

515
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,929
UIBezierPath to draw            
a triangle on screen.           

516
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,965
First, I'm gonna create         
the path by just saying,        

517
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,099
path = UIBezierPath().          

518
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,768
There are other                 
initializers for it,            

519
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,735
which we'll see in the demo.    

520
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,371
But this one just creates       
a blank path to start.          

521
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,206
Then, you move around           
with the path.                  

522
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,876
So like I can say,              
move to, which (80,             

523
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,480
50) is like halfway across      
this, this little screen.       

524
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,949
This is small screen,           
let's say, 160 points wide.     

525
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,751
80 and then 50 down, okay?      

526
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,556
Then I'm gonna add a line down  
to 140, 50, see that, okay?     

527
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,659
Then I'm gonna add              
another line over to 10,        

528
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,929
off to the left,                
I'm still 150 down.             

529
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,832
Then I'm gonna close the path,  
okay, using close, and          

530
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,101
that just closes it             
back to the start.              

531
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,436
So look, I made a triangle,     
okay, really easy.              

532
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,940
Now, the only thing is,         
all this code right here would  

533
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,410
actually draw, instead of       
that triangle right there,      

534
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,113
would draw this: nothing.       

535
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,083
You would see no drawing with   
that code because we haven't    

536
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,117
stroked or filled it.           

537
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,386
The stroking and                
filling is what draws.          

538
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,754
So how do we do                 
the stroking and fill?          

539
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,157
Well, we need to set the        
colors that we wanna fill and   

540
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,792
stroke with.                    

541
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,261
But here, I'm taking green and  

542
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,829
sending it                      
the message setFill.            

543
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,865
So you actually set             
your color to fill with         

544
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,601
by sending a message            
to a color.                     

545
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,969
You get a color, and            
you send it a message,          

546
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,237
set that as my fill color.      

547
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,104
And the same thing              
with a stroke,                  

548
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:28,772
set it as a stroke color.       

549
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,842
So I set my stroke color to     
red, my fill color to green.    

550
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,613
But when I'm talking about      
attributes like line width,     

551
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,716
I send that to the path,        
to the UIBezierPath.            

552
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,318
Set your line width to three,   
okay, so I do that.             

553
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:45,622
Now, if I say path.fill,        
now I get a green triangle.     

554
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:46,823
Because my fill                 
color was green,                

555
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,859
and it takes that path and      
it fills it in.                 

556
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,594
That's what fill does.          

557
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,563
And similarly,                  
if I say path.stroke,           

558
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,332
I get a red line around.        

559
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,802
Because the path that I took    
to get around there gets        

560
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,206
stroked with a three-point      
wide red line.                  

561
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,841
So that's it,                   
that's quite simple actually.   

562
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,543
That's how we draw.             

563
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,979
And, UIBezierPath also knows    
how to draw a lot of common     

564
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,380
Okay?                           

565
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,350
shapes, like rounded            
rectangles, and ovals, and      

566
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,053
things like that, so you        
should familiarize yourself     

567
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,256
with UIBezierPath's API,        
of course.                      

568
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,392
Another cool thing you can      
do with UIBezierPath is you     

569
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,094
create a path like              
that triangle, and              

570
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,798
you can clip all your           
drawings to that path.          

571
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,367
So you could draw this          
elaborate picture that only     

572
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:33,003
show the part that shows        
through that triangle,          

573
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,938
if you take that triangle       
path that we just created and   

574
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,073
say add clip to it.             

575
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:37,841
Because after that,             

576
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,012
all drawing is only gonna       
show up inside that triangle,   

577
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,381
you can make some pretty        
cool effects by doing it.       

578
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,683
which is kinda cool,            

579
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,485
The UIBezierPath                
also knows how to,              

580
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,521
it has this method              
contains that will,             

581
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,389
tell you whether a point        
is inside the path.             

582
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,126
So that's good if you want to   
do some touch thing or people   

583
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,962
are touching on something and   
you wanna do hit detection,     

584
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,997
basically, what                 
they're touching on.            

585
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,933
All right, and there's tons of  
other stuff in UIBezierPath,    

586
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,567
don't have time to cover it,    
you should look it up.          

587
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,369
Okay, UIColor.                  

588
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,972
So UIColor, really simple.      

589
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,641
Okay, there's some common       
colors like green, red,         

590
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,808
yellow, purple.                 

591
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,610
Those have type                 
methods on UIColor.             

592
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,278
Remember, type methods,         
static methods?                 

593
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,046
They're on the type.            

594
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,247
You don't need                  
an instance of it.              

595
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,416
So that's like UIColor.green.   

596
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,686
But there's also initializers   
that let you create colors      

597
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:27,057
from RGB, red, green, blue, or  
HSB, that's hue, saturation,    

598
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,575
You can even create a color     
that's made from a pattern.     

599
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,026
brightness.                     

600
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,794
So that when you draw           
with that color,                

601
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,296
it's drawing in a pattern.      

602
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,164
Okay, like a really             
thick line,                     

603
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,099
we'd actually be showing        
the details of a pattern,       

604
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,067
which is kind of fun,           
using UIImage,                  

605
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,303
which I'll talk about           
in a little bit.                

606
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,640
Of course, all UIViews          
have a background color.        

607
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,743
We saw this when we did our     
buttons in the calculator,      

608
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,211
we made the background color    

609
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,848
of a lot of our buttons be      
light gray, and I'm sure in     

610
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,649
the homework assignments        
you made it other colors.       

611
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,718
Okay, that's just               
a var on UIView,                

612
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,820
that button inherited           
from UIView.                    

613
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,155
And you can set it to           
any UIColor you want.           

614
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,359
Now, an interesting thing       
about colors though is that     

615
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,163
they can be transparent, or     
even semi-transparent, okay?    

616
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,299
And they are done,              
you specify that with alpha.    

617
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,900
How many people here            
know what alpha                 

618
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:11,936
is when it comes to graphics?   

619
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,137
Okay, so hardly anybody.        

620
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:18,141
So alpha is just a value        
between 0 and 1, where 0 means  

621
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,144
fully transparent and           
1 is fully opaque.              

622
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,247
So if you have a color          
like a triangle and             

623
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,016
you fill it with green,         
then if it's fully opaque,      

624
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,551
you can't see anything          
behind that triangle.           

625
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,787
But if it were 50%, 0.5 alpha,  

626
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,189
then you'd be able              
to see the green but            

627
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,927
you'd also be able to see the   
things behind it a little bit.  

628
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,728
50% kinda, okay?                

629
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,230
If it was zero,                 
you wouldn't see any            

630
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,165
green because it would          
be fully transparent.           

631
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,267
You'd be looking all            
the way through it, so          

632
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,102
you wouldn't see any green,     
okay?                           

633
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,304
So, all that you can put        
anywhere in that range, and     

634
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,906
the way you create a            
transparent color is by taking  

635
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,710
a opaque color and saying,      
withAlphaComponent,             

636
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,946
whatever alpha you              
want between 0 and 1.           

637
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,281
Okay?                           
And that gives you              

638
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,314
a transparent or                

639
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,251
semi-transparent version        
of the color.                   

640
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,352
And you can draw with that.     

641
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:07,557
However, if you draw with       
transparency in your UIView,    

642
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,927
you must set this               
var on your UIView.             

643
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,530
This is just a var              
in UIView to false.             

644
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,265
Okay?                           
Because views assume that       

645
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,234
they're fully opaque, okay?     

646
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,035
And that's performance          
enhancement.                    

647
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,870
It turns out drawing            
with transparency,              

648
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,173
as you might imagine, takes     
a little bit of CPU power       

649
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,042
to figure out which pixels      
show through and all that.      

650
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,878
So, by default, it assumes      
you're drawing fully opaque.    

651
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,480
So if you wanna draw            
with transparency,              

652
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,050
don't forget to set             
opaque here to false.           

653
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,921
By the way, you can make your   
entire view semi-transparent    

654
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,389
by setting its alpha.           

655
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,558
So this is a var,               
not in color,                   

656
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,226
this is a var in UIView.        

657
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,995
You can say, alpha 0.5,         

658
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,899
in your entire view will        
be 50% see-through.             

659
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,267
And that would work             
with a button or                

660
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,102
anything because those          
are just UIViews.               

661
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,071
Alright?                        

662
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,709
What happens when               
views overlap and               

663
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,944
we have transparency            
in the views?                   

664
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,214
Well, then that subviews        
that we're talking about,       

665
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,951
all the subviews of a view      
starts to matter in the order.  

666
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,486
So the first thing              
in the subview,                 

667
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,689
subview sub zero, that's        
all the way in the back.        

668
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,925
And then everything else        
is in the order in front of     

669
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,859
it, okay?                       

670
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,062
And so, any transparency        
that's going on is things       

671
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,598
stacked up in that order, and   
you're looking down through     

672
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,334
the transparency, all           
the way up to subview zero,     

673
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,437
so which is in the back, okay?  

674
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,406
You can also completely         
hide a view.                    

675
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,043
This is very similar--almost    
identical to--saying            

676
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:33,977
alpha equals zero.              

677
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,812
Which will just make the view   
not even appear, but            

678
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,246
it will be still in             
the view hierarchy.             

679
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,049
It will be still in             
its superview and               

680
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,384
its subviews will still         
be subviews of it, but          

681
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,753
it all will be                  
completely hidden.              

682
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,155
And why would you               
wanna do this?                  

683
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,492
Maybe you have some UI where    
you don't wanna show a button   

684
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,060
until the user has entered      
some other field or             

685
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:51,695
something like that.            

686
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,929
But you wanna make room for     
the button.                     

687
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,931
You want it to be               
ready to appear, so             

688
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,434
you leave it in the view        
hierarchy, but hidden.          

689
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,437
Okay?                           
Alright,                        

690
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:01,638
let's talk about drawing text.  

691
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,605
How do we draw text?            

692
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,108
Well, one way to draw text      
you already know is UILabel.    

693
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,078
You could just create a         
UILabel and make it a subview   

694
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,280
of your view and bingo, you     
got some text in your view.     

695
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,082
And now,                        
the only problem with that is,  

696
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,452
you're drawing in your draw,    
your drawRect thing,            

697
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,919
you're drawing in there.        

698
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,589
And you have to make sure you   
drew, if you're drawing around  

699
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,725
the text that it all lined      
up with your subviews.          

700
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,328
So sometimes you wanna          
draw in drawRect, right?        

701
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,495
You want to actually            
draw in there.                  

702
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,464
And the way you do that         
is with a class called          

703
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,833
NSAttributedString, okay?       

704
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,504
So NSAttributedString           
is not a string.                

705
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,607
It's not related in any way     
actually to string, and         

706
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,844
it's not even an NSString       
which is the old Objective-C    

707
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,813
style string that was           
indexed by ints where           

708
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,650
the Swift's one is indexed by   
string.index, unfortunately.    

709
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,486
It's neither of those,          
it's its own thing.             

710
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,220
Okay?                           

711
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,790
It's very closely               
aligned to old NSString,        

712
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,725
not as closely aligned          
to the modern string.           

713
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,695
But anyway, what an attributed  
string is it's a string,        

714
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,864
you can make it out of          
a string or an NSString.        

715
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,267
And those characters have       
attributes, colors and          

716
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,370
fonts and                       
things like that, okay?         

717
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,337
And it's very simple,           

718
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,772
you create one of               
these strings and               

719
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,708
you just send it to message     
draw at and it will draw        

720
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:15,045
that string at that point       
at its upper left corner.       

721
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,997
Then you can even find out      
the size it's going to need to  

722
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:19,047
Okay?                           

723
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,352
draw it by sending the message  
size to an attributed string.   

724
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,954
Okay?                           
Now one thing that's            

725
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,422
kind of bummer about            
attributed string,              

726
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,928
it's really an old style API,   

727
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,065
var and let don't even work     
to make it mutable or not.      

728
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,368
So if you want a mutable        
attributed string, attributed   

729
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,236
string where you're gonna       
change its attributes and       

730
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,005
change its text, you need to    
have a different class called   

731
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,010
NSMutableAttributedString.      

732
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,945
So things like set attributes,  
and things of that,             

733
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,380
don't work on                   
an attributed string.           

734
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,917
You have a mutable              
attributed string.              

735
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:56,486
Now, you can, if you have an    
attributed string, mutable or   

736
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,422
not, you can get back           
the string that's in it         

737
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:03,493
as a string object using        
the var string, or              

738
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,128
mutable string in               
a mutable case.                 

739
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:07,763
That's kinda                    
confusing because,              

740
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,333
of course, you're used to var   
and let being how a string is   

741
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,970
mutable or not, but that's how  
you can get the string back.    

742
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,872
But let's talk about how        
you set the attributes.         

743
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,142
So you set the attributes just  
by passing in this dictionary,  

744
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,043
called attributes there.        

745
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:23,113
You can either set attributes   
or add attributes to what's     

746
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,282
already there, and              
this dictionary, String:Any,    

747
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,985
the string is just a key like   
this is telling you what        

748
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,422
the attribute is, like it's a   
font, or a color, or whatever.  

749
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,723
And then the Any is,            

750
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,258
it might be a font,             
it might be a color,            

751
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,161
depends on what the key is,     
that's why it's an Any there,   

752
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,464
because it can be               
all kinds of things.            

753
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,799
And really important to         
notice here is the range.       

754
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,500
You see that range?             

755
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,270
It's not range that I           
talked to you on Wednesday,     

756
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,938
it's NSRange.                   

757
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,042
NSRange is an integer indexed   
range into that string,         

758
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,512
that attributed string.         

759
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,881
Old style integer,              
not string.index.               

760
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,117
So this makes for a lot of      
trouble when you're using       

761
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,653
attributed string               
in the Swift world.             

762
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:07,156
And my recommendation to you    
is that you use this method or  

763
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,792
this var rather on              
String called utf16.            

764
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,462
utf16 will give you             
back what's called              

765
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,197
a String.UTF16View.             

766
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,634
That is a collection of the     
characters, it's not really     

767
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,304
a collection like characters    
is, but it is a representation  

768
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,975
of the string as distinct       
16-bit Unicode characters.      

769
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,510
Which is much more aligned,     
in fact I think it's exactly    

770
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,280
aligned, to what                
NSString does.                  

771
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,616
The only problem is,            
that thing that it gets,        

772
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,351
that comes back, is still       
indexed by String.Index.        

773
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,588
So you have to say what's the   
startIndex, offset by five,     

774
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,124
that kind of business to        
move around in there.           

775
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,093
And plus, you can't pass        
a range of String.Index into    

776
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,228
this setAttribute.              

777
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,364
So you have to kinda            
convert from String.Index,      

778
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,466
how much you've advanced over,  

779
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,003
to an integer when you          
make these NSRanges.            

780
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,571
So, I'm sorry to                
say it's difficult.             

781
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm not gonna actually          
ask you to do that,             

782
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,374
this in the homework.           

783
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,176
Partially because it, it's      
kind of a pain in the neck.     

784
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,445
And I don't want you to         
spend your valuable homework    

785
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,179
time working on it.             

786
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,315
But just know,                  
if you start using this,        

787
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,919
that you're gonna have this     
unfortunate disconnect.         

788
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,087
And I keep hoping every         
time iOS comes out,             

789
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,723
they'll come out with an        
attributed string, not NS, but  

790
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,225
attributed string,              
that's matched up with string.  

791
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,161
But they haven't done it yet.   

792
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,230
It's pretty complicated to do,  
I can imagine, so.              

793
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,600
So what are some of these       
attributes that you can set?    

794
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,302
So there's things like          
NSForegroundColorAttributeN-    

795
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,471
ame, that's how you set         
the color of the text.          

796
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,241
There's also                    
NSBackgroundColorAttributeName  

797
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,343
which, fonts have foregrounds   
and backgrounds, but            

798
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,612
don't worry about               
that too much.                  

799
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,413
NSStrokeWidth so                

800
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,082
you can draw your characters    
really thick or thin.           

801
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,585
NSFontAttributeName, where      
you can provide a font.         

802
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,187
And there's about 15 others,    

803
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,957
and you can go look in the      
documentation for all of them.  

804
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,024
But speaking of fonts,          

805
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,259
if you wanna set the font       
you're gonna draw with,         

806
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,127
how do you do that?             

807
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,297
Well, fonts are super           
important in iOS.               

808
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,100
Never underestimate the power   
of a font in building           

809
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,001
a cool UI.                      

810
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:58,935
Look at all these UIs.          

811
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,971
Look at how important           
the choice of font, size,       

812
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,774
position, all that stuff is.    

813
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,377
So, how do we get a good font   
so that our UI will look good?  

814
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,914
Well, we're gonna use this      
very important static           

815
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:11,881
method in UIFont.               

816
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,551
So you send this to UIFont,     
the class,                      

817
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,720
called preferredFont            
forTextStyle, okay?             

818
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,457
And so you can specify the      
text style, which is kind of    

819
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,360
like, what's the environment    
you're gonna use this text,     

820
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,461
what kinda text is it?          

821
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,531
And so there's about eight or   
so of them.                     

822
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,300
But three of them               
are like a headline.            

823
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,334
This is gonna be a headline.    

824
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,404
So that's gonna be a bolder     
font, a little larger maybe.    

825
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,540
Then body font, that's like,    
this is the user's data.        

826
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,575
So in a Mail message,           

827
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,110
this would be the message       
they're actually typing         

828
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,346
maybe--although it's            
probably a multi-font.          

829
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,682
But, and then footnote would    
just be a small little text,    

830
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,151
you see, from the bottom?       

831
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,121
So I really encourage you       
when you're using a font,       

832
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,756
try to find a text style        
that will work, okay?           

833
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,291
Because it's gonna              
be in sync and                  

834
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,060
compatible with all             
the other apps,                 

835
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,395
because they're using           
these preferred fonts.          

836
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,132
And also, by the way,           
if a user goes in Settings and  

837
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,367
sets their font size            
to be really large,             

838
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,802
these will automatically        
get larger, okay?               

839
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,207
And, hopefully, if you have     
your Auto-Layout working,       

840
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,743
everything will expand or       
contract properly, okay?        

841
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,378
There's also system fonts.      

842
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,580
Don't get confused between      
the preferred fonts and         

843
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,751
system fonts.                   

844
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,020
Preferred fonts are for         
the user's content.             

845
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,157
So, that's                      
the difference there.           

846
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,626
Now, most of this stuff,        
again,                          

847
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,160
you're not even                 
gonna set in code.              

848
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,196
You're gonna set it in          
Interface Builder in            

849
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,997
the little Inspector window,    
right?                          

850
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,700
You're gonna be setting,        
both preferred fonts and        

851
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,736
system fonts can be set there.  

852
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,474
If you wanna use a specific     
font like Helvetica Bold 13     

853
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,843
point, you can do that.         

854
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,011
I don't recommend it,           

855
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,114
but UIFontDescriptor is         
an important class to know      

856
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,299
It's how you describe           
that font that you want,        

857
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,416
for that.                       

858
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,417
that special font.              

859
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,153
So, you know, some apps,        
typography is what they do.     

860
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,622
And so they need to be          
able to do specific fonts.      

861
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,358
Alright, so that's text.        

862
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,993
How about drawing images?       

863
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,829
So images, again, you,          
we have a thing like UILabel.   

864
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,897
It's called UIImageView.        

865
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,033
And you could just make         
an image be a subview of        

866
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,369
your view if you wanted to      
have an image in there.         

867
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,171
But, again, sometimes you       
wanna be able to control that   

868
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,373
in your draw, your drawRect.    

869
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,742
And we do that with             
the UIImage object, okay?       

870
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,578
I already showed you actually   
when I was talking about        

871
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,846
failable initializers           
how to create a UIImage.        

872
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,016
You just put it in              
your xcassets file              

873
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,884
in Interface Builder.           

874
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,622
And then you say UIImage        
named, and it gets it by name.  

875
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,457
And if it can't find it,        
it returns nil.                 

876
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,193
So that's the number one way    
you're gonna get an image into  

877
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,661
your app is put                 
it in xcassets.                 

878
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,863
But there are other             
ways to do it.                  

879
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,665
You can get it from a file,     
like if you had a .jpg file.    

880
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,800
Of course, I haven't shown      
you how to get files.           

881
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,369
So you don't know               
how to do that yet.             

882
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,471
But, you can do it that way.    

883
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,240
And you can also get it just    
from raw data, raw jpg data or  

884
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,977
something that you got over     
the Internet or from a URL or   

885
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,711
something, you can do that.     

886
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,548
You can even do it by drawing   
with all those path things.     

887
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,150
You can use this                
UIGraphicsBeginImageContext     

888
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,652
for a certain size region.      

889
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,188
And then you can just           
use UIBezierpath draw or        

890
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:08,191
get graphics context,           
whatever, draw in there.        

891
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,960
And then there's                
an EndImageContext.             

892
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,396
And it'll capture it and        
create a little image for you.  

893
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,265
So that's another               
way to do it.                   

894
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,168
So once you have an image,      
okay, that you got from any of  

895
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,836
these sources, you can just     
draw it inside your drawRect    

896
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,307
by saying draw atPoint or       
draw inRect.                    

897
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,878
Or actually, I think that's     
probably drawAt space point,    

898
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,546
not atPoint:.                   

899
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:35,385
And drawIn space rect and       
drawAsPatternIn space rect.     

900
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,820
Those do kind of what           
you would think, right?         

901
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,023
draw atPoint draws it where     
that's the upper left hand      

902
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,091
corner, it draws it             
in its natural size.            

903
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,694
draw inRect is going to         
scale it to fit inside          

904
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,164
the rectangle                   
that you provide.               

905
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,332
And drawAsPattern               
is gonna tile it.               

906
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,067
So presumably that's            
a small image and               

907
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,869
you're drawing a texture or     
something.                      

908
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,306
And it's gonna                  
repeat it over and              

909
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,342
over to fill the rectangle,     
okay?                           

910
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,110
I'll fix this slide and         
repost it.                      

911
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:05,748
Alright, one thing to be        
careful of with UIView.         

912
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,917
When UIView changes size,       

913
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:11,587
you do not get asked            
to redraw by default.           

914
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,556
What it does is, believe it or  

915
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,293
not, takes what you've drawn,   
grabs the pixels, and           

916
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,229
stretches them to               
fit the new bounds.             

917
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,465
Okay, now, this is often        
not what you want.              

918
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,667
Often, what you want is,        
okay, if my bounds change,      

919
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:28,170
ask me to redraw again          
in my new bounds, okay?         

920
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,039
So how is this controlled?      

921
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,042
It's controlled via this var    
in UIView called contentMode.   

922
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,245
And the contentMode can be      
things like left, right, top,   

923
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,014
bottom, topRight, topLeft.      

924
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,150
That's basically saying,        
take my bits and                

925
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,618
shove them up into              
the left corner you know,       

926
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,621
one of these spots,             
center or right.                

927
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,656
Don't touch,                    
don't do anything with them,    

928
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,123
just move them in               
the new bounds.                 

929
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,560
Well, that's likely to cut off  
what you've drawn or something  

930
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,928
like that depending on how      
much the bounds have changed.   

931
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,630
Like when you rotate,           
you know,                       

932
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,699
the bounds changes              
quite a bit.                    

933
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,334
There's also the scaling ones.  

934
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,703
And this is the default,        
scaleToFill.                    

935
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,873
And that says, take my bits     
and take my new bounds and      

936
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,241
scale it to fill.               

937
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,243
I can preserve the aspect       
ratio if I want.                

938
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,044
Although, again,                

939
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,079
that's probably gonna           
cut something off.              

940
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:13,215
But the real one that           
you want is redraw.             

941
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,518
If you set your                 
contentMode to be .redraw,      

942
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,221
then when your bounds change,   
your draw is gonna be           

943
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,892
called--your drawRect,          
draw with the rect argument.    

944
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,194
So in your assignment three,    
you're gonna wanna do this.     

945
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,429
You can actually do this,       

946
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,264
you can do it in code           
by setting that var.            

947
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,433
But you can also do it in       
Interface Builder, okay?        

948
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,569
In the Utilities window,        
in the Inspector preview.       

949
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,905
Just, I think it's the very     
top one, contentMode.           

950
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,776
All right, so I'm, I'm gonna    
be leaving the slides here so   

951
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,245
I will tell you                 
what's coming up.               

952
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,147
I'm gonna do this demo right    
now where I'm gonna do          

953
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,084
a custom view, a FaceView,      
a UIView that draws a face.     

954
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,920
And then Wednesday,             
I'm gonna talk about gestures.  

955
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,055
We'll add some gestures         
to control our face.            

956
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,658
And I'm gonna start talking     
about multiple MVCs,            

957
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,794
I'll finish up with             
multiple MVCs next week.        

958
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,964
Your assignment three requires  
you to do multiple MVCs, so     

959
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,500
I'm not going to make it due    
until a week from next Monday,  

960
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,802
because you'll need             
next Monday's lecture.          

961
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,306
However, I'll probably ship     
the assignment, the write-up,   

962
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,909
on Wednesday, because a big     
part of that assignment         

963
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,478
is drawing your own custom      
view and you'll certainly know  

964
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,080
everything you need to know     
to do that right off the bat.   

965
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,983
So you can kind of get          
started on the view, and        

966
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,418
then next Monday, you can       
start doing the multiple MVCs.  

967
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,354
And you'll still have a full    
week until the next Monday,     

968
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,156
to get that done, alright.      

969
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,858
No Friday section this week.    

970
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,562
Okay, so as with most           
demos in this course,           

971
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,666
I'm going to start              
from scratch, okay.             

972
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,101
We're going to do               
a completely new app.           

973
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,836
No more calculator in here.     

974
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,603
So I could click on here        
to open my calculator.          

975
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:45,508
But instead, I'm gonna go back  
here to Create a new project.   

976
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,576
Okay, it's gonna be             
Single View Application,        

977
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,877
as I told you they              
all would be.                   

978
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,747
I'm gonna call this             
one FaceIt, okay.               

979
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,449
And it's gonna start out        
just drawing a face, but        

980
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,184
it's gonna do much              
more eventually.                

981
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,654
And, still no core data or      
testing stuff yet, so           

982
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,790
I'm just gonna do FaceIt here.  

983
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,191
It's gonna say where            
do you want it?                 

984
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,360
I'm gonna put it in the same    
place the calculator is,        

985
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,094
in my Developer.                

986
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,228
I'm not gonna be using SCM.     

987
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:06,963
But of course,                  

988
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,165
those of you come who           
came to Friday section,         

989
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,633
you'll know how to use that.    

990
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,603
And here is my new app here.    

991
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,538
And I'm also going to           
do my standard thing,           

992
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,706
where I'm gonna take these      
supporting files and            

993
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,841
move them out of our way.       

994
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,444
So they don't distract          
us every time we look at        

995
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,513
the Navigator here.             

996
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,783
Because we don't need           
those for this demo.            

997
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:32,154
So just like every other thing  
we've done, we have a view.     

998
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,324
Here's our story                
board with our view.            

999
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,393
Oops, not that small.           

1000
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,862
And of course,                  
we have our controller.         

1001
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,530
And I'm gonna delete this       
out of the controller,          

1002
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,800
as usual here.                  

1003
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,303
And this time, we're going      
to start right off here         

1004
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,539
by building a custom UIView,    
custom UIView subclass.         

1005
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,274
Now, the way we do that         
is the saw way we built         

1006
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,176
the CalculatorBrain.            

1007
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,811
We go here, new file, right.    

1008
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,714
That's how we add new           
files to our project.           

1009
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,716
But this time, for              

1010
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,985
CalculatorBrain we chose Swift  
File because it, you know,      

1011
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,186
it wasn't a UI thing.           

1012
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,288
It didn't inherit               
from any iOS class.             

1013
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,391
But now we're gonna choose      
Cocoa Touch Class, because      

1014
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,461
it's gonna be a subclass of     
a Cocoa Touch UIKit class.      

1015
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,463
So we click that.               

1016
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,165
It says, what do you want       
it to be a subclass of?         

1017
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,401
And we want UIView, but you     
can see there's other things.   

1018
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,902
UIViewController, and           

1019
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,337
other things that we'll         
learn later in the quarter.     

1020
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,673
But this is                     
a subclass of UIView.           

1021
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,607
I'm gonna call it FaceView,     

1022
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,177
because it's a view             
that draws a face.              

1023
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,912
Okay, it's a good name.         

1024
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,714
Alright, so we click here.      

1025
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,382
It says,                        
where do you wanna put it?      

1026
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,618
We usually wanna be very        
careful to put it in the same   

1027
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,052
place as everything else is.    

1028
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,521
You don't want it in            
Supporting Files, and           

1029
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,422
you don't want it at this top   
level, the project level.       

1030
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,858
You want it inside              
this folder right here,         

1031
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,560
that has all your stuff in it.  

1032
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,462
So we'll do that.               

1033
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,397
Alright, so                     
here's our FaceView.            

1034
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,567
And you can see right off the   
bat in FaceView, we get this.   

1035
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,970
Which is our draw, okay,        
the draw with the rect.         

1036
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,340
Notice that it is               
commented out.                  

1037
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,041
And that's because for          

1038
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:03,145
performance reasons, iOS        
doesn't want to ask views that  

1039
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,214
don't actually do any drawing,  
to draw.                        

1040
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,816
Because it has to keep          
a backing store for             

1041
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,818
them, and there's memory        
stores and all this stuff.      

1042
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,921
So by default this              
comes commented out.            

1043
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,956
But of course,                  
our FaceView is going to draw.  

1044
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,458
It's going to draw a face.      

1045
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:18,227
So we're going to               
un-comment it out.              

1046
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,331
Okay, now we have               
a FaceView here,                

1047
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,432
it doesn't draw anything.       

1048
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,803
But I actually wanna briefly    
go back to our storyboard, and  

1049
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,938
put a FaceView in               
the storyboard.                 

1050
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:32,875
And it's really simple but      
I want to show it to you.       

1051
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,976
if we go down to the Object     
Palette at the bottom here,     

1052
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,010
And again,                      

1053
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,512
where we got our buttons and    

1054
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,481
labels, you know I could        
search here forever.            

1055
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,316
There's no FaceView in here.    

1056
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:43,252
But I can go down towards       
the bottom here, and            

1057
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,420
you will see this one.          

1058
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,023
It's actually almost at         
the very bottom, it's View.     

1059
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,291
See, it represents a            
rectangular region which draws  

1060
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,293
and receives events,            
as promised.                    

1061
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,063
And so I can pick this          
guy up and drag him out.        

1062
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:58,568
Okay, and drop him here         
inside this view controller.    

1063
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,402
And remember that the top       
level view in this view         

1064
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,738
controller is                   
a var called view.              

1065
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,807
Okay, a very important var.     

1066
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:08,010
Now, I want this view to        
fill the whole space.           

1067
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,314
So I'm actually gonna use       
the blue dash lines to          

1068
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,518
make this thing fit the entire  
space, you see that?            

1069
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,988
Now, well, I also want to       
do the Ctrl-dragging to         

1070
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,590
the edges that we did in        
calculator, remember that?      

1071
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,992
But it's actually kind of hard  
to do this because I want it    

1072
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,795
all the way to the edges.       

1073
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,131
But since I used the blue       
lines, I can use a really cool  

1074
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,067
feature which is down here,     
this button.                    

1075
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,068
You see this button in          
the lower right here?           

1076
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,603
It says                         
Resolve Auto Layout Issues.     

1077
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,705
If you click that,              

1078
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,942
one of the choices is to Reset  
to Suggested Constraints.       

1079
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,779
So that is the system saying,   
I'll make your constraints for  

1080
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,914
you based on what you           
did with the blue lines.        

1081
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,483
So I'm gonna look               
at your blue lines.             

1082
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,752
Since I used blue lines         
all at the edges,               

1083
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,354
if I say Reset to               
Suggested Constraints,          

1084
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,957
it's gonna hook those           
things to the edges.            

1085
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,592
Because that's what             
it looked I wanted.             

1086
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,128
Now I can double-check what it  
gave me by clicking here on     

1087
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,730
the Size Inspector.             

1088
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,998
And if you look down            
towards the bottom of           

1089
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,400
the Size Inspector, you can     
see all your constraints.       

1090
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,536
And look at that, perfect       
Trailing Space to Superview,    

1091
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,738
leading space here.             

1092
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,640
Excellent, all                  
exactly what I want.            

1093
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,943
So here, I've gotten all my     
Auto-Layout with one click.     

1094
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,412
And that's going to be          
possible to do quite a bit.     

1095
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,846
If you use those                
blue lines and                  

1096
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,882
you say Reset to                
Suggested Constraints,          

1097
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,617
often it'll at                  
least get close.                

1098
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,987
And then you can kinda tweak    
the ones it didn't get right.   

1099
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,656
Now, the other crucial          
thing I have to do here         

1100
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,559
is that this is                 
currently a UIView.             

1101
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,496
If I go over here to            
this inspector here,            

1102
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,299
which is the Identity           
Inspector, you can see that     

1103
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:41,637
the class of the selected       
thing is UIView.                

1104
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,372
So no matter what               
I put in my draw,               

1105
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,406
it would never be called.       

1106
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,476
Because this is not             
a FaceView, it's a UIView.      

1107
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,847
But I can just click here, and  
go down and choose FaceView.    

1108
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,518
And now I've made               
this a FaceView.                

1109
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,119
all the code I put in my draw   
is going to draw in here.       

1110
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,653
So now,                         

1111
00:45:58,723 --> 00:45:59,488
And that's it,                  

1112
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,158
that's all I need to do to      
put a custom view into my UI.   

1113
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,825
It's very common to want        
to put a custom view            

1114
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,426
in, in the UI.                  

1115
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,830
So that's why it's so           
simple to do.                   

1116
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:11,767
Now all we need to do           
here is in our FaceView,        

1117
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:14,636
write the code that             
draws--draws our face.          

1118
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,538
So what are we gonna            
do to draw a face?              

1119
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,243
Well, I'm just gonna draw the   
kind of emoji face, this round  

1120
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,779
circle for a head, two          
round eyes, a little smile.     

1121
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,614
Okay, a very simple face.       

1122
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,584
And, let's start by drawing     
the skull of our face, the,     

1123
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,253
kind of the head of this face.  

1124
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,456
And I just start doing          
that in draw here.              

1125
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,758
I'm going to use                
UIBezierPath to do all this.    

1126
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,528
So I don't actually even        
need to get the context.        

1127
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,864
That UI get graphics, get       
context, don't even do that.    

1128
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,499
Just use UIBezierPath           
automatically                   

1129
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,833
knows what context you're in.   

1130
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,902
So you don't have               
to do any of that.              

1131
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,637
So what do I need               
to do though?                   

1132
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,874
I need to kind of think         
of how big my face is.          

1133
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,543
I want my face, if I'm in       
portrait or landscape, I also   

1134
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,613
want my face to kind of be      
the smaller of the two sides,   

1135
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:58,481
the height or the width.        

1136
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,248
You know what I mean?           

1137
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,451
Because I always want the face  
to fully fit in there.          

1138
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,522
So I'm going to let my          
skullRadius, so that's gonna    

1139
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,559
be the radius of my skull,      
okay, equal the minimum.        

1140
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:11,927
And there's this nice min,      

1141
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,129
you see that min                
function right there?           

1142
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,799
It's generic-typed              
like an array.                  

1143
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,200
Array of T, so that's the T.    

1144
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,368
It will take any type.          

1145
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,836
And it will compare             
two things, and                 

1146
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,572
return the one                  
that's the lowest.              

1147
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,808
So I'm going to get             
the minimum of my bound,        

1148
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:30,412
bounds.size.width and           
my bounds.size.height.          

1149
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,814
And then I'm going to divide    
it by 2, because it's radius,   

1150
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,915
not diameter.                   

1151
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,618
So now,                         
see what I'm doing here?        

1152
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,954
I'm just making it so that my   
radius of my skull will be      

1153
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,424
smaller of the width or         
height.                         

1154
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,392
And then, what about where      
I want the skull to be?         

1155
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:44,860
Well, I want it to be           
right in the center.            

1156
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:51,700
So can I say, let               
skullCenter equal my center?    

1157
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,736
Okay, that's a method,          
can I say that?                 

1158
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,838
That's a var,                   
anything wrong with that?       

1159
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,241
No, I see shaking heads--why    
not, what's wrong with that?    

1160
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,077
Yeah?                           

1161
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,483
He says because it'll           
start from the top left.        

1162
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,684
Not quite.                      

1163
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,419
Anyone else wanna take          
a stab at this one?             

1164
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,558
It's because center, while it   
is the center of this view,     

1165
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,995
it's in the wrong               
coordinate system.              

1166
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,330
This center is in my            
superview's coordinate system   

1167
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,464
and I'm in draw.                

1168
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,099
I need to be in my              
coordinate system.              

1169
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,268
So there's actually two         
things I can do here.           

1170
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,804
One I could use this cool       
function in view called         

1171
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,640
convert which will              
convert a point                 

1172
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,509
from one coordinate             
system to another.              

1173
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,045
So I can go down                
to this one okay,               

1174
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,481
convert CGPoint from view, and  

1175
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,353
I could convert this point      
center from my superview.       

1176
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,423
Okay, so just using             
center I can convert it.        

1177
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,526
That would be fine, because     
I've converted it from one      

1178
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,462
coordinate system,              
my superviews, to mine.         

1179
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,298
That's probably a little,       

1180
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,733
someone reading                 
this code is like,              

1181
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:59,135
hm, why are they doing that?    

1182
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:03,505
A simpler way to do it is       
probably just to create         

1183
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:08,944
a point, a CGPoint, that is     
my bounds midX, that's my       

1184
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:14,850
middle X, see, that's a rect    
thing, and my bounds midY.      

1185
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,453
Okay.                           

1186
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,687
So I'm just creating            
the point that is the center,   

1187
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:19,854
That makes sense?               

1188
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,525
much more                       
straightforwardly there.        

1189
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,860
All right, so now I have        
my radius and the center.       

1190
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,494
Now I need to draw a circle.    

1191
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:27,629
So how do I draw a circle?      

1192
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,865
I'm gonna do that               
with UIBezierPath.              

1193
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:33,002
So I'm gonna say let path       
equal a UIBezierPath.           

1194
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,836
Now, when we look at            
the constructors for            

1195
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:38,807
UIBezierPath here you can       
see that we can draw an arc.    

1196
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,342
Which is actually what          
I'm going to use.               

1197
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,611
We could draw an oval,          
which would be cool,            

1198
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,346
except the argument is a rect,  
and                             

1199
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,614
I have the center and           
the radius.                     

1200
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,983
So I can't, I don't             
really want to use oval.        

1201
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:48,984
We could draw a rectangle.      

1202
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,186
I want a circle,                
so that's no good.              

1203
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,121
Or a rounded rect.              

1204
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,355
I actually want the circle,     

1205
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,090
not a rectangle of any kind,    
okay?                           

1206
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,560
So I'm gonna use this one       
right here which draws an arc.  

1207
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:01,263
It just takes a center point    
and it draws a sweeping arc.    

1208
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,966
And I'm gonna draw this         
arc all the way around          

1209
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:06,101
to make a circle, okay?         

1210
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:06,835
So how does that work?          

1211
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:09,070
Here, I'm gonna make            
some more space.                

1212
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,807
All right, so it wants to       
know the center of the arc.     

1213
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,309
Well, that's my skull center,   
right?                          

1214
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,478
It wants to know the radius     
of the arc, well,               

1215
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:19,080
that's my skullRadius,          
this easy.                      

1216
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,749
It wants to know                
the start angle.                

1217
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,052
So that's the angle that        
it's gonna start sweeping.      

1218
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:24,920
I'm gonna choose 0,             

1219
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:30,526
the angle 0 is straight         
out to your right.              

1220
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,861
Okay, so if you're              
looking at the screen,          

1221
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,830
to the right straight across,   
that's 0.                       

1222
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,099
And it's in radians,            

1223
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,235
how many people know what       
radians are to measure angle?   

1224
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,269
Okay most of you.               

1225
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,138
So radians instead of degrees,  

1226
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,908
we measure how much we're       
going up by radians.            

1227
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,244
Radians go from zero all        
the way around to two pi.       

1228
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,412
Around the circle.              

1229
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:53,949
Start at zero and then it       
will go around, pi over two,    

1230
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,852
pi, you know,                   
then pi is 180 degrees and      

1231
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,521
then around to two              
pi is 360 degrees.              

1232
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,191
So it's in radians, so this     
end angle has to be in radians  

1233
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,592
and I wanna go all              
the way around.                 

1234
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,761
So it's 2 times pi.             

1235
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,163
We know that Double.pi is pi.   

1236
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,766
And then clockwise is whether   
I'm gonna draw the arc around   

1237
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,301
clockwise or the other way.     

1238
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,336
It doesn't matter because I'm   
going all the way around to     

1239
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,171
get back to the start anyway.   

1240
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,706
So I'll just say false.         

1241
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,841
There you go,                   
counter-clockwise.              

1242
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,110
Now, I got a warning here,      
an error.                       

1243
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:22,845
Let's look at that error.       

1244
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,147
What does it say, it says       
the binary operator* (and is    

1245
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,485
pointing to this little         
multiplier right here) cannot   

1246
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,121
be applied to 'Int' and         
'Double'.                       

1247
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,489
Why is it saying that?          

1248
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,759
These arguments                 
to UIBezierPath,                

1249
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,428
the floating point arguments    
like a startAngle and           

1250
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:42,531
endAngle, what type do you      
think it's supposed to be?      

1251
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,803
No one?                         

1252
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,472
I hear it being whispered,      
yes, CGFloat.                   

1253
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,541
All drawing has to be CGFloat.  

1254
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,011
So is Double.pi,                
is that a CG float?             

1255
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,045
No, it's a double.              

1256
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,214
Is two a CGFloat?               

1257
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,382
Well it might be.               

1258
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,784
But Swift would have to         
infer that it's a CGFloat.      

1259
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,187
And right now Swift is          
confused about what that's      

1260
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,122
supposed to be because it       
knows this argument is          

1261
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,724
supposed to be a CGFloat, but   

1262
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,425
the thing you're multiplying    
it by is a Double.              

1263
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,628
So Swift doesn't know           
what to infer here.             

1264
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:15,264
Doesn't know whether to         
refer that to as a Double or    

1265
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,265
a CGFloat.                      

1266
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,302
So the fix here, luckily,       
CGFloat has a pi.               

1267
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,439
Just like double does.          

1268
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,308
Now, everybody's happy,         
because Swift knows how to      

1269
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,745
interpret this                  
literal as a CGFloat.           

1270
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,247
And this argument to            
the endAngle is now a CGFloat.  

1271
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,114
So now everybody's happy.       

1272
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,151
It's only complained that       
we don't use path yet.          

1273
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,519
Okay?                           

1274
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,554
Excellent, so now we got        
this arc going all around.      

1275
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,558
Let's set something about the   
path like it's line width for   

1276
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,193
example, we'll set a nice,      
fairly thick line,              

1277
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,330
five points wide,               
that's what that means,         

1278
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,432
five point zero,                
five points wide.               

1279
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,334
And then let's set the color.   

1280
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:56,171
So I'm gonna get UIColor,       
let's say, blue color and       

1281
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,743
we'll say set, and by the way   
there's setFill and setStroke.  

1282
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,110
There's also just set.          

1283
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,346
Set sets both the fill and      
the stroke.                     

1284
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,482
Here we only need to set        
the stroke color, but           

1285
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,351
I'll just say set so            
that you learn about that one.  

1286
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,521
And now I can just say          
path stroke okay and            

1287
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,924
it's going to                   
stroke that path.               

1288
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,025
So let's see what               
this looks like.                

1289
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,495
Let's go do iPhone 7 here.      

1290
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,600
So hopefully this is            
gonna draw our skull.           

1291
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,145
There we go, a skull.           

1292
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,647
Whoo, first time, excellent.    

1293
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,083
Okay, now I don't like          
the look of that very           

1294
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,419
much because it goes all        
the way to the edges and        

1295
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,555
with a thick line that's        
actually cut off a little bit.  

1296
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,057
So I want to move that in       
a little bit so we'll do that.  

1297
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:51,794
Let's rotate and                
go from portrait to landscape.  

1298
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,032
Not good, not good.             

1299
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,734
Okay, why is that happening?    

1300
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,234
That it's doing that.           

1301
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,401
Well, that's that content       

1302
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,904
mode thing I was                
talking about, right?           

1303
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,307
It's not calling my draw        
when it goes to this other      

1304
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,113
bound size right there, so      
it's just scaling the bits.     

1305
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,547
So let's fix both               
of those things,                

1306
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,784
let's make it go in a little    
bit, and let's fix those bits.  

1307
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,887
To fix the bits, we're          
just gonna go back to our       

1308
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,024
storyboard, and                 
click on our view right here.   

1309
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,459
Lets get rid of this.           

1310
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:28,029
Okay, click on our View,        
and go over to Utilities.       

1311
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,866
Inspect this with the           
Attributes Inspector and look,  

1312
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,603
the very first one,             
Content Mode, Scales to Fill.   

1313
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,605
Every time the bounds change    
it's scales to bits to fill     

1314
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,375
and we want Redraw.             

1315
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,777
We could also probably          
use Center, but                 

1316
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,280
I actually want Redraw because  
if my bounds got smaller for    

1317
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,148
example, I'd wanna              
draw my face smaller.           

1318
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,951
I wouldn't want                 
to get cut off.                 

1319
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,052
Okay, so there's Redraw.        

1320
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,588
That fixed that one,            
that was easy to fix.           

1321
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,725
What about making this          
thing kinda smaller?            

1322
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:02,631
To do that, I'm actually gonna  
create a var called scale.      

1323
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,268
And it's a drawing thing so     
it's a CGFloat.                 

1324
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,871
And I'm going to set it         
to let's say 0.9 and            

1325
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,406
that's going to mean 90%.       

1326
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,574
All I'm going to do             
is take my radius and           

1327
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,777
multiply it by that scale.      

1328
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,780
So by multiplying               
my radius by 0.9 or             

1329
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:21,450
90% it should zoom move         
it in a little bit right.       

1330
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,585
Kind of in from                 
the edges by 90%.               

1331
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:29,358
So let's see if both            
those things got fixed.         

1332
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:34,929
So the 90% worked.              

1333
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:40,235
Clearly, it's in 90% and        
the rotation works also.        

1334
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,204
So we're off to                 
a good start here,              

1335
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,405
things seem to be               
working just fine.              

1336
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,974
Alright, so, what's             
the next thing we wanna do?     

1337
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,943
Well, we wanna draw eyes and    

1338
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,579
a mouth and things like that,   
I wanna start thinking          

1339
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,814
a little bit about my           
internal architecture.          

1340
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,817
And I'm kinda liking the idea   
of having some private funcs,   

1341
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:58,454
like give me the path for       
the skull.                      

1342
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:04,526
And have that return            
a UIBezierPath that             

1343
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,562
I can then stroke.              

1344
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,130
And then I'll have the same     
thing, give me the path for     

1345
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,464
the eye, give me a path for     

1346
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,398
the mouth,                      
you see what I mean?            

1347
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,466
I'll get all these.             

1348
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,436
And so I can just take          
this code down here             

1349
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,505
that creates this path for      
the skull and                   

1350
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,941
I'll just put it up here and    
I'll just return this path.     

1351
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,412
And then, down here, instead    
of saying paths.stroke,         

1352
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,883
I'll say                        
pathForSkull().stroke().        

1353
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,784
Do you see that?                

1354
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,087
Now, another thing is           
the skullRadius and             

1355
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,756
the skullCenter, I want all     
the other things like the eyes  

1356
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,059
and the mouth to all            
be relative to that.            

1357
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,462
So if I make my skull small I   
need the eyes to get smaller,   

1358
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,730
the mouth to get smaller,       
everything to move in.          

1359
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,232
So I'm gonna use                
these two guys,                 

1360
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,801
I'm gonna make them instead of  
being local variables in draw,  

1361
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:51,707
I'm gonna move them out and     
make them be private vars.      

1362
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,410
And in specific they're gonna   
be private computed vars.       

1363
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,346
So I'm just gonna take          
what they were before and       

1364
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,516
I'm just gonna return them so   
that no matter what my          

1365
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,386
bounds is, at any given time,   
skullRadius,                    

1366
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,989
that var--which of course we    
have to type, so CGFloat--that  

1367
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,459
skullRadius is always going     
to match by bounds, okay?       

1368
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,794
Because every time I ask for    
it,                             

1369
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,396
I'm gonna recompute it          
using this little function.     

1370
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,631
And same thing                  
with skullCenter,               

1371
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,133
I'm gonna say private           
var skullCenter,                

1372
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:23,037
which is also a CGFloat,        
no this one is a CG point, and  

1373
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,807
it's going to be computed.      

1374
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,010
Now, one thing                  
you noticed here,               

1375
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,746
I don't remember if I covered   
this in the other lecture but   

1376
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,549
you notice,                     
I'm not saying get here.        

1377
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,818
See, I'm not putting get and    
set.                            

1378
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,554
Well, I'm not putting set       
because you can't set           

1379
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,955
the skull center.               

1380
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,458
Skull center is always          
the center of my bounds so      

1381
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,559
I can't set it.                 

1382
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,662
And then if you                 
have only a get,                

1383
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,363
turns out you don't             
need the get.                   

1384
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:50,198
Because it's kinda redundant.   

1385
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:54,202
So you get this kinda           
nicer looking code here.        

1386
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:55,604
So now we have skullRadius and  

1387
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,006
skullCenter available           
to all of our methods.          

1388
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,675
And so all our other paths,     
like path for eye and           

1389
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,443
all that stuff can use them.    

1390
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,311
So let's get started on those.  

1391
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,714
Let's do path for               
eye, how about that.            

1392
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,916
So in a private func,           
pathForEye.                     

1393
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,852
Now actually,                   
probably the path for the eye   

1394
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:13,287
is almost the same for the      
left eye and the right eye.     

1395
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:17,125
So I'm gonna create a little    
type here called Eye which      

1396
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,428
is just gonna be                
a little enum.                  

1397
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,601
And it's gonna just be          
the left and right eye, so      

1398
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,537
private enum Eye.               

1399
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:35,844
Let's see Eye is case           
left case right, okay.          

1400
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,713
So I mean it's perfectly        
fine to use an enum             

1401
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,549
just to represent               
something simple like this.     

1402
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,451
You don't have to always        
be doing methods and            

1403
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,419
associated values.              

1404
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:45,820
We don't have any               
associated values here.         

1405
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,057
We're just representing it as   
a way to specify in this API,   

1406
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:54,228
which eye we want the path,     
the UIBezierPath, for.          

1407
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,766
So, by the way, also I          
wanna have some constants       

1408
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,069
that tell me where the eye is   
relative to the center and      

1409
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,038
where the mouth is and          
how big the eyes are.           

1410
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,075
So to save a little bit of      
time here, I'm going to just    

1411
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,913
type those in at the bottom     
here real quick.                

1412
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,581
Look how fast I typed them in.  

1413
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,716
This is, by the way, how we do  

1414
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:20,188
constants in swift we just      
create a struct and we make     

1415
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:25,193
static lets on it which         
are all of our constants and    

1416
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,463
what's really cool about this,  
one it groups them together.    

1417
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,697
Like here I have Ratios,        

1418
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:33,634
it's all the ratios between     
the skull radius and all these  

1419
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,271
things I want to do like        
the eye offset and the mouth.   

1420
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,473
Also it types them.             

1421
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,608
You see these                   
are typed constants.            

1422
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,811
I can put the type in there,    
because they're just vars,      

1423
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,580
they're static vars             
on this struct.                 

1424
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:46,948
Okay.                           
We don't have any storage       

1425
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:47,481
in this struct.                 

1426
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,483
Doesn't have any methods.       

1427
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,318
It just is only used for        
constants here.                 

1428
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:54,523
Now, I'm gonna use these        
constants down here, and        

1429
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,191
I'm gonna use                   
the skull radius and            

1430
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,360
center up here to calculate     
the path for the eye.           

1431
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,295
So how am I gonna do that?      

1432
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,331
First I need                    
the center of the eye.          

1433
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,901
Now, I'm gonna create           
a function to calculate         

1434
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,902
the center of the eye.          

1435
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,337
But I only need it for          
pathForEye.                     

1436
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:13,108
So I'm actually gonna put       
it inside pathForEye.           

1437
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,277
So I'm gonna create             
a function here, centerOfEye.   

1438
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,746
Just gonna type it in quick     
here to save some time.         

1439
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,015
I'll go through it though.      

1440
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,051
And centerOfEye, look how       
it's inside pathForEye.         

1441
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,954
And that's perfectly legal,     
some of you are probably using  

1442
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:27,855
that strategy in                
your assignment two.            

1443
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,225
I think I mentioned it in       
a hint, that you can do it.     

1444
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,160
And all it does is, it keeps    
centerOfEye inside here,        

1445
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,729
because it's not                
needed anywhere else.           

1446
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,564
So now, readers of my code      
don't have to worry about this  

1447
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,899
thing being called              
somewhere else, and             

1448
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,267
what it's semantics             
might be out there.             

1449
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:41,702
They already know that it's     
only used in this nice,         

1450
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,239
little space right here, so     
it's kind of a nice way to      

1451
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,842
arrange your code to make       
it a little more readable.      

1452
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:49,510
So how does centerOfEye work?   

1453
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,279
Well it takes the eye, and      

1454
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:54,782
it just gets the eye offset by  
taking the skull radius and     

1455
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,584
dividing it by one              
of those constants,             

1456
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,287
the ratio between the skull     
radius to the eye offset,       

1457
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,322
that's how much it's            
gonna offset the eye.           

1458
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,991
Now I'm gonna offset the eye    
the same amount up as I do      

1459
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,726
to the sides.                   

1460
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:09,230
So the line between             
the nose of our face, and       

1461
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,332
the two eyes is gonna be        
equilateral triangles, or no,   

1462
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,134
not quite equilaterals.         

1463
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:13,935
It can be a little wider, but   

1464
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:19,040
the same distance going up as   
it is going out to the sides.   

1465
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,709
I'm gonna start with the        
eyeCenter being in the center.  

1466
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,310
And then,                       

1467
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,145
I'm starting with the eye in    
the center of the face, and     

1468
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,080
then I'm gonna move it up and   
over.                           

1469
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,515
Okay.                           
So here I'm moving it up.       

1470
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:30,352
Notice that up is               
minus the eye offset,           

1471
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,222
because decreasing y is up,     
increasing y is down.           

1472
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:38,793
And for x, I'm going to         
add the eye offset or           

1473
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,129
subtract the eye offset,        

1474
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,164
depending on whether it's       
the left eye or the right eye.  

1475
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:46,234
So for the left eye, I'm going  
to subtract the eye offset.     

1476
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:48,437
And for the right eye, I'm      
going to add the eye offset.    

1477
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:50,371
Okay?                           

1478
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,773
Everyone understand             
that little                     

1479
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:52,974
construct right there, I hope.  

1480
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,343
Okay and then it's              
returning the center.           

1481
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,044
So now I have                   
the center of the eye.          

1482
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,880
So using the center             
of the eye,                     

1483
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:02,084
I can say let the eye radius    
equal the skull radius          

1484
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:10,024
divided by the ratio for        
that one,                       

1485
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:16,364
which is                        
skullRadiusToEyeRadius.         

1486
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,766
Okay, so                        
that's what I'm gonna do.       

1487
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,469
And I'm gonna let               
the eyeCenter just              

1488
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,137
equal centerOfEye,              
whichever eye.                  

1489
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,306
The eye that's up here.         

1490
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,510
So I'm just calling this        
little function right here.     

1491
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:33,681
And so                          
I have those two things.        

1492
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,583
So I can just create            
another circle.                 

1493
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:39,087
So I'm going to let path        
equal UIBezierPath and          

1494
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,555
do that arc again.              

1495
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,190
Here the center is              
the eye center.                 

1496
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,492
And the radius is               
the eye radius.                 

1497
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,461
And the start angle             
is still zero.                  

1498
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,530
Then end angle is still         
CGFloat.pi* 2, and clockwise,   

1499
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,264
it doesn't matter.              

1500
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,400
I'll go the other               
way this time.                  

1501
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,769
Okay, so there's my path.       

1502
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,439
Let's set path.lineWidth        
equal 5.0 again.                

1503
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,341
Starting to get tired           
of typing that.                 

1504
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,876
It's probably not               
a good thing.                   

1505
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,145
And then let's                  
return the path.                

1506
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,013
Okay.                           
So that's it.                   

1507
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,949
So that gets the path for       
either the left eye or          

1508
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:11,052
the right eye.                  

1509
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,356
we'll say pathForEye,           
the left eye, stroke.           

1510
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,561
Okay, pathForEye,               
the right eye, stroke.          

1511
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,964
Okay, I hope everyone's         
comfortable with the fact that  

1512
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,866
I'm calling a method,           
taking this return value, and   

1513
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,201
immediately sending             
it a message.                   

1514
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,271
So, let's see how this went.    

1515
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,239
Let's see if we                 
got this right.                 

1516
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,348
Look at that.                   

1517
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,415
FIrst time.                     

1518
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,884
It's really going well today.   

1519
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:45,186
Okay, so there's our two        
lines, they look good.          

1520
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,621
You know what would be          
kind of cool though?            

1521
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,957
If we could have open eyes and  
closed eyes.                    

1522
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,760
So how could we, how could      
we have open eyes and           

1523
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,229
How about this: let's go up     
here and just like we had this  

1524
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,630
closed eyes?                    

1525
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,633
var scale which by the way      
notice I left the var public.   

1526
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,568
Scale, so that people who       
are using my face view,         

1527
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,236
they can control                
the size of the face.           

1528
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,505
I don't mind.                   

1529
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,107
And, I'm also gonna have eyes   
open, which is going to be      

1530
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,409
a bool, which will              
start out being false.          

1531
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,344
And we're just gonna            
make our pathForEye,            

1532
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,314
look at this var,               
look at the value of this var.  

1533
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,583
And either have the eyes        
open or closed.                 

1534
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,052
So, I'm back here in path for   
eye.                            

1535
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,322
So, if the eyes are open then   
we're just gonna do what we     

1536
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,925
were already doing here,        
this business.                  

1537
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:26,027
Okay, because that's            
what we did so far.             

1538
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:27,962
But if the eyes are closed,     

1539
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,497
then I want the path            
to be different.                

1540
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,099
So, watch what I'm              
gonna do here.                  

1541
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:37,172
Let path be a UIBezierPath      
without a value to start.       

1542
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:42,744
Okay, and then I set it here,   
and I'm gonna set it here, and  

1543
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,212
that's allowed.                 

1544
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:46,147
In other words Swift is         
smart enough to know,           

1545
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,417
you created a let, which can    
only be initialized once.       

1546
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,019
But you conditionally           
initialized it here,            

1547
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,356
because now I'm gonna           
say path equals.                

1548
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:56,257
And for the closed case         
I'm just gonna make             

1549
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,793
a bezier path that              
starts out blank.               

1550
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,662
And then I'm gonna              
just move to, line to,          

1551
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,032
to make a little horizontal     
line for a closed eye.          

1552
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,435
So, I'm gonna say               
path.move(to: ) to move to      

1553
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:12,974
a point, CGPoint, we use        
this constructor right here.    

1554
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:18,512
Not that one, let's use,        
this one, CGFloat.              

1555
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,548
And the point we're gonna       
move to we're gonna move to     

1556
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:24,652
the eyeCenter x                 
minus the eyeRadius.            

1557
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,087
So, we're gonna move to         
the center of the eye and       

1558
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:29,023
back up with the eye there.     

1559
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,092
And we're gonna be              
at the eyeCenter.y.             

1560
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,994
So, we're gonna right           
in the eyeCenter and            

1561
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:34,229
we're gonna draw                
a horizontal line so            

1562
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:36,664
we're gonna move to             
the left side of it.            

1563
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:41,303
And then we're going to add     
a line to the right side.       

1564
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:47,008
So, another CGPoint             
which is this one again.        

1565
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,543
And this one is going           
to be the eyeCenter.x           

1566
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,779
plus the eyeRadius.             

1567
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:56,184
And it's still at               
the eyeCenter, okay?            

1568
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,685
Make sense?                     

1569
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:59,087
Two more parentheses in there.  

1570
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,089
Everyone see what I did there?  

1571
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,758
But I just wanna make           
sure you understood this        

1572
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:04,759
thing of let path.              

1573
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,129
You don't have to say equals    
here as long as this if then    

1574
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:12,867
still only initializes it       
once and doesn't change it.     

1575
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,135
Because it's still              
a valid let.                    

1576
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,305
So, let's go take               
a look at that.                 

1577
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:26,815
Okay, eyes closed.              

1578
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,148
Excellent, okay?                

1579
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,350
They're closed eyes.            

1580
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,386
We can go back here,            
set this to true.               

1581
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,522
And again,                      
we should get open eyes.        

1582
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,158
Questions?                      

1583
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,894
So, the question is when        
do people do a custom           

1584
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,931
view like this when they        
draw off their own thing?       

1585
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,900
In other words, when they       
don't use this built in things  

1586
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,502
like button and things like     
that well it depends on         

1587
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,471
the content that                
they are providing.             

1588
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,107
But a lot of times, maybe they  
are not drawing with arcs and   

1589
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,277
circles, maybe they're drawing  
with images and text okay?      

1590
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,380
They're laying how they         
want down to a level or         

1591
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,349
in an orientation that those    
can do or maybe they're doing   

1592
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,553
text along a curve, which you   
can do with this for example.   

1593
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,721
So, it's that kind of thing.    

1594
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,456
You might not see raw           
drawing like this.              

1595
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,091
We're doing raw drawing         
because it's simple and         

1596
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,328
I'm trying to show              
you how you do it.              

1597
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,796
But there are apps              
that are drawing                

1598
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,530
apps where you can take         
your finger and draw.           

1599
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,799
They would clearly do           
this as well right,             

1600
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,868
some of you might do that       
as your final project.          

1601
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:23,138
Okay, so                        
anyway there's our eye.         

1602
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,873
So, we've got our eyes going,   
we've got our skull.            

1603
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:26,607
How about our mouth?            

1604
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,409
We've gotta get the mouth       
going so let's go do that.      

1605
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,144
And we're gonna do              
the same thing there.           

1606
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:34,882
I'm gonna have a private        
func pathForMouth and           

1607
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:38,453
it's gonna be a UIBezierPath.   

1608
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,154
So, how I'm going               
to do the mouth.                

1609
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,956
Actually, I'm going to start    
by drawing the mouth as         

1610
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:42,991
a rectangle,                    

1611
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,426
just to show you where I'm      
gonna put it on screen.         

1612
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,795
And then we'll turn it,         
we'll use a bezier curve,       

1613
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,130
actually, to make the mouth.    

1614
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,832
So, how am I going to do that?  

1615
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,468
First, I'm going to calculate   

1616
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:57,638
some things like the width      
of the mouth, the height of     

1617
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,307
the mouth, and the offset of    
the mouth--the offset down      

1618
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:03,411
from the middle of              
the face--using more of these   

1619
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,980
ratios.                         

1620
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,214
So, I'm just calculating        
the mouth, width,               

1621
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,350
height, and offset.             

1622
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,619
Now, I'm gonna use that to      
create the rectangle in which   

1623
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,354
I'm going to put the mouth.     

1624
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:18,993
Let's do that, let mouthRect    
equal and so the mouthRect      

1625
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,462
is gotta be offset down         
by the mouth offset.            

1626
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,831
And it's gonna be the width     
and height, so let's do that.   

1627
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:28,602
So, CGRect we'll use this       
constructor right here,         

1628
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,573
CGFloat, we'll do               
the skull's center dot x        

1629
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:36,511
minus the mouth's width,        
divided by two.                 

1630
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,514
So that's, because we           
obviously want the mouth        

1631
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,450
centered in there,              
and then for y,                 

1632
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:46,354
we'll use the skullCenter.y     
plus the mouthOffset.           

1633
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,389
And again it's plus,            

1634
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:52,093
because plus is down            
in our drawing system.          

1635
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:57,932
And the width is just           
the mouthWidth and              

1636
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,368
the height is the mouthHeight.  

1637
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:04,005
Let me make this a little       
easier to read like this.       

1638
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,414
Everyone understand what I'm    

1639
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,948
doing there with                
the mouse rect?                 

1640
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,383
Let's just draw this rect.      

1641
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,720
So, I can say let path          
equal UIBezierPath.             

1642
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,355
BezierPath knows                
how do a rect.                  

1643
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:23,724
It's this one down here.        

1644
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:29,531
The rect is our mouthRect and   
let's just return that path.    

1645
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,433
So, now we've got a path for    
the mouth.                      

1646
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,102
Let's go down here and          

1647
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,139
stroke it by saying             
pathForMouth().stroke().        

1648
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,909
Let's see what                  
this looks like.                

1649
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,917
Okay, excellent.                

1650
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,352
So, we have a mouth.            

1651
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:53,721
Kinda looks like a robot face.  

1652
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,024
We want it to have a nice       
curve, a smile or a frown.      

1653
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,527
So, we gotta start thinking     
a little bit how we're gonna    

1654
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:03,297
represent whether this          
is smiling or frowning.         

1655
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:07,669
And so I'm gonna introduce      
another var, up at the top,     

1656
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:09,736
here, just like I have it       
with the eyes are open.         

1657
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:15,109
I'm gonna have a var which I'm  
gonna call mouthCurvature and   

1658
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:17,445
make it be a Double.            

1659
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,015
I'll set it to,                 
let's say 1.0 and               

1660
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:25,553
the semantics of this I'm       
going to have it be that        

1661
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:30,491
1.0 is full smile and           
minus 1.0 is full frown.        

1662
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,093
And this is going to be public  
and this is going to be         

1663
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,963
the public API that someone     
uses when they want to use my   

1664
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:39,299
FaceView to tell me how much    
this mouth should be smiling.   

1665
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,836
Okay, the mouth                 
curvature right here.           

1666
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,270
And I've just                   
defined it this way.            

1667
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,073
It's public,                    
I've documented it.             

1668
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:48,242
And so people can set it        
to whatever they want.          

1669
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,043
So I'm going to use             
this now to do it.              

1670
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,713
Now one thing is I've defined   
it as a double because,         

1671
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,983
you know I'm not actually       
doing the drawing right now     

1672
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,152
I'm just talking conceptually   
what curvature is.              

1673
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,722
So, I need to convert this in   
the some meaningful CGFloat,    

1674
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,824
and then use that               
to draw this mouth.             

1675
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,459
So, how am I gonna do that?     

1676
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:08,562
The way I'm gonna do that do    
that is let's get this back up  

1677
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,033
here and I'll show you, on the  
rectangle that we have here.    

1678
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,803
I'm gonna use what's            
called a Bezier curve,          

1679
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,639
how many people know            
what is Bezier curve is?        

1680
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,474
Only one person!                

1681
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:23,777
My Gosh, okay so                
a Bezier curve is just          

1682
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,114
two end points a line           
between two end points but      

1683
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:30,050
there are two other points      
called control points.          

1684
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,518
And you can kinda think it as,  

1685
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,188
think of it as the line         
starts out at the start,        

1686
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,957
starts heading for              
one of the control points.      

1687
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,693
As it gets close, it starts     
heading for the other one.      

1688
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,395
And as it gets close to that    
one, it starts heading for      

1689
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,596
the end, okay.                  

1690
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,032
So, the control points kind     
of pull on the line and         

1691
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,234
give it some curve.             

1692
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,335
And you can put those control   
points anywhere you want.       

1693
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,571
Obviously, we're gonna          
put ours like this.             

1694
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,774
So, my start is gonna be right  
here in the middle of this      

1695
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:56,110
line and                        
my end is gonna be right here.  

1696
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:58,378
So we're gonna draw             
a line across here.             

1697
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,047
And my two control              
points are going to             

1698
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,752
be down here somewhere,         
on both sides of his chin.      

1699
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,087
the line is gonna start here,   
start down towards this one.    

1700
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,354
And so                          

1701
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:08,322
Whoop.                          
Starting going to               

1702
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:09,090
the other one.                  

1703
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,192
Whoop. Come back up here.       
And make a little smile.        

1704
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:14,228
And if I move my                
control points up to            

1705
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:15,129
the top, then whoop.            

1706
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:15,897
It'll be a frown.               

1707
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,033
Everyone understand that.       

1708
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:19,967
So I need four points.          

1709
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,702
The start, the end, and         
the two control points.         

1710
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:22,570
Let's do those.                 

1711
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,973
The start is easy,              

1712
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,442
that's just the middle          
of the left edge, okay.         

1713
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,912
So I can say                    
the start is CGPoint.           

1714
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:36,116
And again we'll do              
this kind of CGPoint.           

1715
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:41,655
And it's going to be the mouth  
rect, our little mouth rect,    

1716
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:46,193
MinX, that's the left edge,     
the minimum X, and              

1717
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:51,499
mouthRect.midY, that's          
halfway up the mouth rect.      

1718
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:55,136
And the end is going            
to be CGPoint.                  

1719
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,871
This float.                     

1720
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,575
And this one's gonna be         
the mouthrect.maxX and          

1721
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:03,377
mouthrect.midY on               
the other side.                 

1722
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:04,712
So the two ends,                
start and end,                  

1723
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,981
are right in the middle of my   
mouth rect on either side.      

1724
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,483
So now I need those             
two control points.             

1725
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,519
For the control points I need   
to think of how far down        

1726
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,887
they're going to be.            

1727
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,190
And it depends on               
the mouth curvature.            

1728
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,059
The more smile I want, the      
farther down they need to be.   

1729
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,929
The more frown I want, the      
farther up they need to be.     

1730
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:25,666
So I'm gonna create another     
thing called smileOffset.       

1731
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,703
And this is gonna be a          
CGFloat, because it's gonna be  

1732
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,173
something that I'm using        
to do drawing here.             

1733
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:38,512
And I'm gonna make it equal     
to the mouthCurvature,          

1734
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:44,718
which is a double,              
times the mouth rect.height.    

1735
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,988
So I will move down those       
control points all the way      

1736
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:51,959
the entire height of a mouth    
rect if I'm fully smiling.      

1737
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:54,261
Now, there's some problems      
with this line of code.         

1738
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,563
One is, if you look at          
these things right here,        

1739
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,300
it's saying you can't multiply  
a Double times a Float.         

1740
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,536
This is a float,                
this is a double.               

1741
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,238
So I'm gonna have to            
convert this to a float         

1742
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,008
by using a constructor for      
CGFloat.                        

1743
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:10,077
Luckily, it has one that        
takes a double okay.            

1744
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,914
Another thing here is smile     
offset has to be between,       

1745
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:15,249
you know, one, or sorry,        

1746
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:18,485
mouth curvature here has to     
be between one and minus one.   

1747
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,020
So I'm gonna enforce that.      

1748
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,789
Because I wouldn't want this    
path curvature to be five, and  

1749
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:23,891
now he's smiling so             

1750
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,160
big that it's, you know,        
on the floor literally.         

1751
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,960
Jaws on the floor.              

1752
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:27,795
We don't want that.             

1753
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,664
So I'm going to use min and     
max to do that.                 

1754
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:33,067
I'm gonna say max               
minus one of min                

1755
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:36,236
of the mouth curvature and      
one.                            

1756
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,972
And that's going to restrict    
it to be between minus one      

1757
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:39,774
and one.                        

1758
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,143
Everybody got that.             

1759
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:46,047
I'm just using min and          
max to do that there.           

1760
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,549
And notice that                 
it's automatically              

1761
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,584
made these be doubles,          
which is fine.                  

1762
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,087
So the result of min and        
max is double, and              

1763
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,789
that's being converted          
to a CGFloat.                   

1764
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:55,656
That works fine.                

1765
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,993
Okay, so now that I             
have that smile offset,         

1766
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,961
I can say how far down          
my control points are.          

1767
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,465
So I'm gonna let cp1, which is  
control point one, it's gonna   

1768
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,402
be smile offset times           
the mouth rect height down.     

1769
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,871
And I'm gonna make              
the two control points be       

1770
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:14,242
one third of the way in from    
the edges of the mouth rect.    

1771
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:16,977
Does that make sense?           

1772
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,513
We wanted to kinda head down,   
we wanted to kinda              

1773
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,982
be one-third of the way         
along from each side.           

1774
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,583
So cp1 is gonna                 
be on the left.                 

1775
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:27,188
That's gonna be a CGPoint.      

1776
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,189
And this again.                 

1777
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:35,196
And so                          
this one will be the start.x.   

1778
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,364
Start is where we're            
starting right here.            

1779
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,434
Plus the mouthRect.width        
divided by three.               

1780
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:42,637
So I'm going a third            
of the way across.              

1781
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:47,441
And then the y is a start.y     
plus the smile offset           

1782
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:50,211
which could be negative if      
mouth curvature is negative.    

1783
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,246
Smile offset might be           
negative, meaning going up.     

1784
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:53,881
And so, this will be a frown.   

1785
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:56,116
Or it could be positive and     
then it will go down.           

1786
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:59,786
Then cp2 is almost exactly      
the same so I'll copy and       

1787
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,288
paste it, cp2.                  

1788
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:04,858
It's just that here we're       
gonna go to the end and         

1789
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:08,295
move back by mouthRect.width.   

1790
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:11,732
But it's still it's at          
the same level okay because we  

1791
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:15,002
want it to come down, go        
across, and then come back up.  

1792
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,704
So now that we have             
these control points and        

1793
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,973
the start and the end, now we   
can draw that in the path.      

1794
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,842
So we'll just do go our         
Bézier path right here.         

1795
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,479
We'll leave the rect in there   
at first so we can see it.      

1796
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:31,285
And I'm just gonna tell         
the path to move to a CGPoint,  

1797
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:35,155
which is the start and,         
actually,                       

1798
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:38,658
you don't even                  
need to do that.                

1799
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,328
You just say,                   
move to the start.              

1800
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:45,098
And then, we're gonna           
draw a curve, addCurve,         

1801
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:47,901
which adds one of               
the Bezier curves.              

1802
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,736
And we're going to the end.     

1803
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:54,341
And the control point is cp1,   
and the other is cp2.           

1804
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:54,976
So let's take a look.           

1805
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,820
Alright, excellent, so we       
have mouth curvature is 1.0,    

1806
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:08,722
we've got a nice                
big old smile.                  

1807
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,891
Okay, we don't really want      
this square there anymore,      

1808
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,127
rectangle, so                   
we'll get rid of that.          

1809
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,763
We can just do that by          
creating an empty Bezier        

1810
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,931
curve to start.                 

1811
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:21,502
Also, we want the path's        
lineWidth to be 5.0.            

1812
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,704
One nice, even amount.          

1813
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:25,606
And let's go ahead and          
check some other things.        

1814
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:28,375
Let's see if the mouth          
of minus 0.5.                   

1815
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,912
Let's see if that gives         
us a slight frown.              

1816
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,447
Should give us a slight frown,  
right.                          

1817
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,690
Neat, okay.                     

1818
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,392
Alright, what's the last        
thing I'm gonna show.           

1819
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,094
One thing that's a little       
bit of a pain is                

1820
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,296
every time I wanna check        
the mouthCurvature,             

1821
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,698
I gotta go run the app.         

1822
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,299
Back, change it, run.           

1823
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:53,934
Or every time eyes open,        
eyes closed.                    

1824
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,204
Back and forth.                 

1825
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:00,007
in Interface Builder, okay?     

1826
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,141
I can see a button              

1827
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,976
when I change it's things       
in Interface Builder.           

1828
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,013
And wouldn't it even be cooler  
if I could have an inspector    

1829
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:06,947
in Interface Builder,           

1830
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,382
that would let me               
inspect these things.           

1831
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,584
Well, of course                 
we can do that.                 

1832
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,753
How do we do that.              

1833
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:16,357
We go up here, and we just      
make this IBDesignable, okay.   

1834
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:21,428
If you put IBDesignable in      
front of a UIView at the top,   

1835
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:26,400
then when you go over to your   
storyboard, at the top, you're  

1836
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,703
gonna see it here, compiling    
that code, integrating it into  

1837
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:32,639
Interface Builder, and          
showing it to you.              

1838
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,809
Okay now unfortunately we       
don't have an inspector here    

1839
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,778
that allows us to               
inspect those things.           

1840
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:39,346
But we can do that as well.     

1841
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,514
Go back to FaceView here.       

1842
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,715
And I'm going to say for        

1843
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:45,352
example make the scale          
IBInspectable.                  

1844
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:51,525
Let's make eyesOpen             
IBInspectable.                  

1845
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:56,030
Let's make the mouthCurvature   
IBInspectable.                  

1846
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,831
Let's add a few                 
other things here.              

1847
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,601
Let's make the lineWidth        
IB inspectable.                 

1848
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,703
So to do that, we can't have    
this 5.0 going on over here,    

1849
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,572
we're gonna have to add a var.  

1850
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:10,677
So we're just gonna add         
an IBInspectable var.           

1851
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,513
Which is gonna be the line      
width, which is a CGFloat.      

1852
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,784
We'll start it out at 5.0 but   
we'll be able to change it.     

1853
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,420
So now we can go everywhere     
where we have that 5.0.         

1854
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,557
We'll just change               
it to use this var.             

1855
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,728
We can also do the color.       

1856
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:32,065
IBInspectable var the color,    
it's a UI color.                

1857
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:36,003
Okay, we'll start it out        
as blue like it is now.         

1858
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,771
So where we have                
view UIColor.blue,              

1859
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,539
we'll use this var instead.     

1860
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,741
Alright, we'll give             
you a color blue.               

1861
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,911
I'm just gonna say color,       
to set the color.               

1862
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,847
Okay, so basically it's taking  
all the things in my app and    

1863
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,383
just making them not            
only configurable,              

1864
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,653
as public variables,            
but also inspectable.           

1865
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,089
So let's go back to our story   
board and see if this works.    

1866
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,191
Sure enough, right away,        
you see up at the top there,    

1867
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,696
Face View, the scale, whether   
the eyes are open, line width,  

1868
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,132
the color, mouth curvature,     
are now inspectable.            

1869
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:07,901
So let's close the eyes.        

1870
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:12,606
Let's have the mouth            
curvature be 0.5.               

1871
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:16,176
Let's make the color            
be orange.                      

1872
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,712
Let's make the line             
width be two.                   

1873
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:22,115
Let's make the scale be 0.5.    

1874
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:26,252
Make the scale be 0.9 again,    
whatever.                       

1875
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,422
Now another interesting thing   
about this is just like if you  

1876
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,458
were inspecting                 
a UIButton here.                

1877
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:34,194
When you run it's going to use  

1878
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,664
these settings as               
the initial settings.           

1879
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,299
You truly are editing this,     

1880
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,167
just like you would             
edit anything else,             

1881
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,771
any other custom view,          
see it comes up like this.      

1882
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:46,673
Got it?                         

1883
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:49,242
Now one thing that you          
have to do when you have        

1884
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:54,414
an IBInspectable is you have    
to explicitly type you cannot   

1885
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:55,816
let Swift infer it.             

1886
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:59,386
Because while Swift can infer,  
Interface builder cannot.       

1887
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,023
It doesn't have                 
an inference engine there.      

1888
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,925
So always make sure you         
put the actual type             

1889
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:10,029
in all the IBInspectables.      

1890
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,965
Alright, that's it!             

1891
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,367
what we're gonna do is we're    
gonna add a model to our MVC.   

1892
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,701
Next time,                      

1893
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,770
And we're gonna start putting   
some gestures in here.          

1894
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:20,707
And then we'll start talking    
about multiple MVCs.            

1895
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:31,384
