Stanford University.

00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:12,978
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193p,  
Developing Applications for     

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,448
IOS, this is Winter             
quarter 2017.                   

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,886
Today we are going to           
talk about a few things.        

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,588
We're gonna start though        
giving a demo about what I      

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,225
talked about last time          
which is multiple MVCs.         

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,928
After that I'm gonna do some    
slides on the view controller   

9
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,931
lifecycle, really important     
mechanism for finding out       

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,002
what's going on with your       
MVC as time goes flows by.      

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,671
And if I have time left at      
the end, I'm gonna start        

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,740
talking a little bit            
about memory management,        

13
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,776
which is basically managing     
the memory of reference types,  

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:45,777
things that are in the heap.    

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,845
How do they get managed?        

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,914
How do they know when           
the stay in the heap, or        

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,616
leave the heap?                 

18
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,219
But first, we're gonna          
start with this demo.           

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,690
I'm calling this demo           
emotions in FaceIt.             

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,758
If you remember last time,      

21
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,094
we built a nice MVC that        
knows how to draw a face.       

22
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,130
It was a pretty                 
generic MVC and                 

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,833
how to model,                   
which is a facial expression.   

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,602
So now we're gonna build a      
more complicated app that has   

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,204
two MVCs.                       

26
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,140
One MVCs is going to let        
you choose an emotion.          

27
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,942
Like happy or sad.              

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,678
And then the other MVC is just  
gonna be our generic face       

29
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,048
view, and                       
it's gonna show that emotion.   

30
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,183
we're gonna learn how to use    
the split view controller and   

31
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,250
By doing that,                  

32
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,020
navigation controller, combine  
MVCs, to make a big graph.      

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,857
It's a simple example because   
of time constraints but         

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,693
you should get the idea.        

35
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,697
So here I'm back in FaceIt,     
this demo we had last time.     

36
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,531
One thing before I start,       

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,134
I wanted to show you something  
you're going to need for        

38
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,169
your homework, which is how     
to rename a ViewController.     

39
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,338
I have this                     
ViewController here.            

40
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,674
This is the ViewController      
that shows the face.            

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,443
Remember, here's the faceView   
var and here's it's model.      

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,880
So I don't like this            
name ViewController.            

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,050
It's really quite too generic.  

44
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,684
It's almost like                
it's super class,               

45
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,486
which is UIViewController.      

46
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,155
Really this wants to be         
some specifically named         

47
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,025
view controller, and in this    
case it shows a face so         

48
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,429
this probably best called       
it faceviewcontroller.          

49
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,231
So I wanna just type            
face right here, and            

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,199
hope that's enough.             

51
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,769
But of course as I mentioned    
in like lecture number one      

52
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,705
that's not enough.              

53
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,740
You can't just                  
rename right there.             

54
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,310
You actually have to rename     
a couple of other things.       

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,412
One, the file that it's in,     
you see the file,               

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,747
is still called                 
viewcontroller.swift.           

57
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,719
We almost always want           
to have our name of             

58
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,689
our file be the same as the     
primary class that's in there.  

59
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,091
Now, it's not required in       
swift, the name of the file     

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,694
could be completely different   
than any class in there.        

61
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,113
to kinda help people find the   
code that they're looking for,  

62
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,464
But generally,                  

63
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,234
we wanna have the name of       
the file pretty much match      

64
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,235
the name of the main class.     

65
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,404
It could be multiple            
classes in a short file,        

66
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,372
that's perfectly                
allowed as well, but            

67
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,974
especially if it                
is the main one.                

68
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,043
You might think,                
well that's enough, but         

69
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,244
there's one more very,          

70
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,947
very important piece of this    
which is in the story board.    

71
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,350
We haven't really talked        
too much about this- well       

72
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,186
actually, we did see it,        
with the Face View.             

73
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,122
We did this with Face View,     
but                             

74
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,591
we need to inspect this         
controller, and I'm             

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,094
gonna click on the controller   
by clicking this orange thing   

76
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:20,097
up here, that represents the    
controller for this whole MVC.  

77
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,001
'm gonna go over to this same   
inspector we went on when we    

78
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,104
changed the face view from      
being a generic UI view to      

79
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,340
being a specific face view.     

80
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,642
'm gonna do the exact           
same thing here.                

81
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,378
So 'm picking this whole        
view controller and             

82
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,147
'm going to the identity        
inspector up here and           

83
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,150
'm gonna change the class       
from ViewController,            

84
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,021
that's what it was the generic  
name to Face view controller.   

85
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,057
So if you forget                
to do this piece,               

86
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,292
than none of your outlets       
are gonna be hooked up.         

87
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,360
And iOS is gonna be very        
confused because you're         

88
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,097
gonna be asking it to couple    
outlets to a different class.   

89
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,033
SomeClasses doesn't exist       
anymore cuz I renamed it away.  

90
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,603
You'll need to do that for      
your homework.                  

91
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,572
You'll have to change           
your current calculator         

92
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,541
MVC from being called           
View Controller                 

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,710
to being called something like  
Calculator View Controller and  

94
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,446
that's because you're gonna     
have this new MVC- the graph    

95
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:12,651
view controller- and you wanna  
make clear which one is which.  

96
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,087
Now I'm not gonna touch my      
Face View Controller or         

97
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,557
MVC at all in this              
demo from here on.              

98
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,861
I'm gonna build this            
multi-MVC app, and              

99
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,630
I'm gonna use the face view     
controller that I just          

100
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,199
finished building last time     
as a reusable component.        

101
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,901
Just like your graph view       

102
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,505
controller is gonna be a        
reusable MVC in your homework.  

103
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,475
I said that I wanted            
to have two MVCs.               

104
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,512
One is just a list              
of some emotions.               

105
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,948
And then I'm going to use this  
MVC to show that emotion.       

106
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,751
So let's just dive              
right into this and             

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,254
put another MVC into            
our storyboard.                 

108
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:53,524
We have this one MVC,           
we get another one, in exactly  

109
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:58,496
the same way that we get a new  
button or something like that,  

110
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,367
which is to go down here        
to the utilities window         

111
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,036
at the bottom here and just     
drag out a view controller.     

112
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,004
You just pull it out and        

113
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,007
drag it right into your         
storyboard like that.           

114
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,443
Now this MVC right here,        

115
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,111
what's gonna be its class       
of it's controller?             

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,814
It's just going to be (if       
we select it by clicking on     

117
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,750
the orange thing),              
UI view controller.             

118
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,951
In other words                  
not a sub class.                

119
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,120
So we're gonna need to create   
a custom sub class for          

120
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,288
this view controller            
just like we have for           

121
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,990
our face view controller.       

122
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,693
We'll do that in a second.      

123
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,594
Before we do that though,       

124
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,095
I wanna talk about              
this little arrow.              

125
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,864
You see this arrow right here?  

126
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,434
This is the arrow that tells    
iOS when this app launches,     

127
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,104
use this MVC as the first       
thing that appears.             

128
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,875
It's like the "entry"           
into the storyboard.            

129
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,610
And so if I want it             
to be the other one,            

130
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,345
I can just pick it              
up with the mouse.              

131
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,679
And drop it on that one.        

132
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,282
And now this one                
is my entry MVC.                

133
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,419
I also want you to notice       
that we have a warning here.    

134
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,987
You see this yellow warning?    

135
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:56,888
I'm gonna click on that,        

136
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,624
and we'll see here it says      
face view controller is         

137
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,127
unreachable, because it         
has no entry points.            

138
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,930
It's saying this view           
controller right here with      

139
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,366
the face, you're never          
gonna see that in your app.     

140
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,235
Which is true, because my app   
is gonna come in here to this   

141
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,405
blank one and I can't get       
to the FaceView from there.     

142
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,075
Now of course we're going to    
add SplitView controller,       

143
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,243
and navigation controllers,     
and we're eventually gonna be   

144
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,012
able to get there, but I just   
want you to understand what     

145
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,114
this unsupported                
configuration means.            

146
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,749
It just means that              
you can't get there.            

147
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,951
If I move this back,            
this arrow off of this and      

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,287
back over to here,              
now this one, you see,          

149
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,555
view controller                 
is unreachable.                 

150
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,758
Which makes perfect sense.      

151
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,028
If I run this app by the way,   
let's go ahead and run, you're  

152
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,697
gonna see that my app's gonna   
come up completely blank.       

153
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,667
That face will not be           
there because that MVC is       

154
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,801
really not even being used.     

155
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,604
It's in the storyboard          
right now, but                  

156
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,339
since it's not accessible       
we can't navigate to it.        

157
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,175
We can't segue to it to         
use the terminology you         

158
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,610
learned last time.              

159
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,979
We get this                     
completely blank UI.            

160
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:01,653
If we want to have things       
like outlets and actions,       

161
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,956
or anything like that, with     
this View Controller, it needs  

162
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,625
to have a custom subclass       
of UI view controller,          

163
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,760
it can't just be generic.       

164
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,594
So we're gonna create that.     

165
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,230
We're gonna go to File, New     
File, remember that's always    

166
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,866
where we go when we create      
a new UI View Subclass,         

167
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,102
a new UI View Controller,       
any Calculator brain.           

168
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,370
We did all those                
from new file.                  

169
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,972
So I'm gonna click new file.    

170
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:26,210
This is gonna be a sub class    
of a UI view controller.        

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm gonna pick this one here,   
cocoa touch class.              

172
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,915
We use swift file over          
here when it was just           

173
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,285
calculator brain,               
not a sub class of anything.    

174
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,753
But here, we're gonna           
do cocoa touch class.           

175
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,589
And it says subclass of what?   

176
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,658
Okay, it's even defaulted       
here to UIVewController.        

177
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,359
Remember earlier                
we picked UIView.               

178
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,494
We're gonna leave this          
UIViewController and I'm gonna  

179
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,498
call this view controller       
my EmotionsViewController.      

180
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,802
So this gonna show              
the emotions like happy,        

181
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,402
sad, whatever, and              

182
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,604
then I'm gonna click on         
it to go show the face.         

183
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,473
So I just do that.              

184
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,908
Go over here, it says           
where do you wanna put it.      

185
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,676
Again, I do not                 
wanna put it here.              

186
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,145
You see where it says           
Group FaceIt, and               

187
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,612
it has that blue icon.          

188
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,548
We wanna put it down in here.   

189
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,549
So if you put it here,          

190
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,584
it's gonna be at                
the very top level.             

191
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,054
Down here, it's with all        
your other classes space        

192
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,856
faceview.swift, etc.            

193
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,391
So make sure you                
remember to do that.            

194
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,094
So here I popped it in there.   

195
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,329
There's my view controller      
selected in the navigator.      

196
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,198
Let's make the navigator        
a little bit wider, so          

197
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,332
you can read it, there we go.   

198
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,234
EmotionsViewController and      

199
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,237
you can see it's giving         
me a little bit of code.        

200
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,973
These right here are part of    
the ViewController life cycle,  

201
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,343
which I promise I'm gonna       
talk about right after this     

202
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,445
but not now.                    

203
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,080
There's this other thing        
that's commented out down       

204
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,583
here, which is actually really  
important to today's lecture.   

205
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,220
This is Navigation method,      

206
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,957
which you know all too          
well from last lecture.         

207
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,059
It's called prepare for segue.  

208
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,465
This is the method that's       
gonna be used when we segue or  

209
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,468
transition from this            
MVC to another one.             

210
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,736
And we have to prepare that     
other one to do its job and     

211
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,805
here's why we do it,            
prepare for segue.              

212
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,040
We'll be coming back and        
implementing prepare for        

213
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,944
segue, in just a minute.        

214
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,480
Now that we have this new       
class, EmotionsViewController,  

215
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,682
we have to do the exact         
same thing we just did.         

216
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,618
Which is to go back             
to our storyboard,              

217
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,421
click on this View controller,  
go to the Utilities window,     

218
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,657
get that identity               
inspector up.                   

219
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,560
And then pick the class in      
EmotionsViewController, so      

220
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,129
that this is now                
an EmotionsViewController,      

221
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,533
not a generic                   
UIView controller.              

222
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,801
So now that we've               
hooked that up,                 

223
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,869
we can start building           
our UI here.                    

224
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,937
What is our UI here?            

225
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,372
It's gonna be super simple,     

226
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,973
I'm just gonna grab             
some buttons, so                

227
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,609
let's get one here,             

228
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,544
let's change some               
attributes of that button.      

229
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,813
How about let's make            
the font really big,            

230
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,784
something like 40 point         
is probably good.               

231
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,753
Let's go ahead and              
make some more of them,         

232
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,255
I'm gonna copy and paste.       

233
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,092
I think three of them is        
enough for this demo.           

234
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,828
We'll have one of our emotions  
be sad, another emotion be      

235
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,798
happy and I don't know if       
this is an emotion but          

236
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,102
we'll have this                 
one be worried.                 

237
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,337
Those are gonna be our three    
things we're gonna show         

238
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,941
with our face.                  

239
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,910
view, let's put a little        
space in between them there.    

240
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,079
We'll fill equally even though  
they're all buttons, so         

241
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,750
they're all gonna be            
filled equally anyway.          

242
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,918
So we've got this nice          
stack view right here.          

243
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,522
Now, one thing about this       
stack view is, if I put it      

244
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,560
here and I go down to look at   
my various orientations and     

245
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,796
devices, if I go                
landscape here, "Ugh!".         

246
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,298
It gets cut off, right?         

247
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,001
So I really want these, this    
stack to stay in the middle.    

248
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,303
I don't wanna do the same       
thing I did with                

249
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,171
the calculator where I'm        
sticking it to the edges.       

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,539
I just want it to stay in       
the middle cuz I don't want     

251
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,974
the buttons to be kinda         
really spread out.              

252
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,743
I want them to stay             
kind of collected but           

253
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,011
I want them in the middle.      

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,146
I can still do that             
with the autolayout,            

255
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,249
the same way we did             
in the last demo.               

256
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,585
I'm just gonna pick             
up the thing and                

257
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,487
use the blue lines to           
indicate what I want.           

258
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,023
Which is I want                 
this in the center.             

259
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,057
I'm holding this, so            

260
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,759
that the blue lines             
come on in the center.          

261
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,731
And when I let go, iOS          
interface builder here knows "  

262
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,832
he wants that in the center".   

263
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,102
So that when I go down here     
to this little guy again and    

264
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,371
I say reset to                  
suggested constraints,          

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,073
just like I did in              
the last lecture,               

266
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,175
it creates constraints          
that put it in the middle.      

267
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,945
And we can verify that by       
going up to this inspector,     

268
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,281
this is the size inspector.     

269
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,548
It shows the size               
of the thing but                

270
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,919
it also shows the constraints,  
the autolayout constraints.     

271
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,255
And this is constrained to      
align its center horizontally   

272
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,857
to the superview center and     

273
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,126
it's centered vertically        
to the superview center.        

274
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,629
Now if we do the rotation,      

275
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,564
we see that it stays            
in the center.                  

276
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,234
I'm giving you a little         
taste of autolayout,            

277
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,336
I'm gonna give a whole          
lecture on autolayout           

278
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,439
in a couple weeks.              

279
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,973
But I'm just trying to          
give you a little hint          

280
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,508
about how it works for now.     

281
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,845
Alright, so we have this,       
this is our UI,                 

282
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,980
that's the entire UI            
that we're gonna do.            

283
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,116
Now let's go ahead and          
run this,                       

284
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,920
run it on iPhone briefly here   

285
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,025
Just to make sure that we've    
actually put this in our UI.    

286
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,027
There it is.                    
Sure enough if I click on it,   

287
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,597
rotation, seems to work fine.   

288
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,866
We can even check to see,       
does this work on iPad?         

289
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,769
Let's try this one              
now right there.                

290
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,008
Here it is, here's our UI.      

291
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,346
It's working fine here and      
we can rotate here as well and  

292
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,215
get this gigantic               
landscape iPad.                 

293
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,717
Is there any way                
to go smaller?                  

294
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,019
What's the smallest             
we can go scale?                

295
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,654
25%?                            

296
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,157
There we go,                    
that's small enough.            

297
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,326
So we've got all this screen    
real estate here on an iPad.    

298
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,128
It's be really great to use     
the split view to have these    

299
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,131
words on the left and the face  
that matches it on the right.   

300
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,299
So that's exactly               
what we're gonna do,            

301
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,935
we're gonna go back to our      
storyboard right here and       

302
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,503
make that happen.               

303
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,273
And to do that, again, is just  
a matter of dragging something  

304
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,642
out, I'm gonna make my          
scale really small here, so     

305
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,510
you can see this                
as we drag it out.              

306
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,879
But here we're gonna drag out   
the split view controller       

307
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,916
cuz we wanna put these          
two MVCs in an MVC              

308
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,851
that has them as                
part of its view.               

309
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,553
So when I drag this out,        
you're actually                 

310
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,022
gonna see I get more            
than just a split view,         

311
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,760
I get some other little MVCs    
that come along with it here.   

312
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,429
And I don't really              
need any of these other         

313
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,830
MVCs that come along with it.   

314
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,232
Trying to make your             
life easier, but                

315
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,267
I find that 99% of the time,    

316
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,270
you don't need these other      
things that come with it.       

317
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,372
So I'm just going here and      
select those and delete them.   

318
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,674
So let's get rid of this one.   

319
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,642
Whoops!                         
Not the whole thing.            

320
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,946
Let's just get                  
rid of this one,                

321
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:39,517
sorry, there and we're gonna    
get rid of this one and         

322
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,718
we get rid of that one.         

323
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,454
I'm just left with my           
split view controller and,      

324
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,556
of course,                      
my two MVCs are here.           

325
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,926
Let's move this little more     
over to the side here,          

326
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,095
scroll down a bit.              

327
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,799
And now I just wanna make this  
be the master of my split view  

328
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,267
controller and                  
I want this to be my detail.    

329
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,002
Whoops, other way around,       

330
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,038
this is the master,             
this is the detail.             

331
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,941
When the app starts,            
I don't want it to start here,  

332
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,444
I want it to start here,        
don't forget this step.         

333
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,945
If you want the app             
to come here and                

334
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,248
then show the split view        
controller with both things.    

335
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,318
So how do I make this the       
master and this the detail?     

336
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,287
I'm just gonna hold             
down control and                

337
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,024
drag from the split view        
controller to the master.       

338
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,360
And then in here,               

339
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,561
Only these two,                 
master and detail.              

340
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,664
So I'm gonna make               
that one the master,            

341
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,233
it makes this little            
master connection there,        

342
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,136
that's not a segue by the way,  
that's a kind of like,          

343
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,238
somewhat like an outlet         
connection but                  

344
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,675
it's a specific connection      
to that master var there.       

345
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,244
This one is the detail.         

346
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,713
So I've made my master and      
my detail here.                 

347
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,581
Zoom in a little bit.           

348
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,585
That's really all I need to do  
to get these both on screen.    

349
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,021
So let's go ahead and run and   
see what happens here.          

350
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,860
Alright, so here we go.         

351
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,262
Sure enough,                    
there's the face on the right.  

352
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,463
Here's this stuff on the left.  

353
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,866
And if I click this,            
nothing happens.                

354
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,934
The face doesn't show.          

355
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,702
Now why does nothing            
happen there?                   

356
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,838
Because we have to do           
the step of having a segue.     

357
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,307
If we want to move              
to a different MVC,             

358
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,977
we have to segue to it.         

359
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,847
Each of these is gonna have to  
have the segue to this MVC.     

360
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,683
And when it segues, it's gonna  
replace that MVC with a new     

361
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,421
one that's properly prepared    
to show that motion.            

362
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,524
Let's go do our segues.         

363
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,092
Segues also of course,          

364
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
we use our favorite gesture     
which is Ctrl + drag.           

365
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,764
So if I wanna make a sad        
segue, I'm just gonna hold      

366
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:38,436
down Ctrl and drag it to the    
MVC that I want to segue to,    

367
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,038
the MVC I want to show          
when I press Sad.               

368
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:41,705
So I do that.                   

369
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,241
Now, you notice that I          
have some choices of what       

370
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,311
kind of presentation,           
what kind of segue I want.      

371
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,913
For example, Present As         
Popover would present           

372
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,683
the thing I'm segueing to in    
a little popover window on      

373
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,819
top of everything else.         

374
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,087
Present Modally would take      
over the whole screen and       

375
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,023
show the new MVC.               

376
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,791
Then there's show and           
show detail.                    

377
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,261
Show is only used when you're   
in a navigation controller,     

378
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,831
the thing where they've got     
the cards sliding on top,       

379
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,466
like the settings               
example I showed you.           

380
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,104
Show detail is used in a split  
view setting or in a hybrid     

381
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,973
setting, where sometimes        
you're in a split view, and     

382
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,174
sometimes you're in             
navigation view,                

383
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,109
which is gonna be the case      
that we're gonna be in here.    

384
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,879
Show detail means show          
this in the detail side of      

385
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,147
the split view.                 

386
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,882
I'm gonna show detail there.    

387
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,051
I've made this segue, you       
see it appeared right here.     

388
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,185
This is a segue,                

389
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,620
looks a little different        
from this thing,                

390
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,356
a little different              
icon right there.               

391
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,323
This is a segue and             
you can click on it, and        

392
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,392
in fact you can                 
even inspect it.                

393
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,194
And you must inspect it,        
in fact,                        

394
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,565
go to the attributes inspector  
and inspect it, because you're  

395
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,367
always gonna wanna give         
every segue an identifier.      

396
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,970
This is just a unique string,   
that in your code you'll        

397
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,738
be able to reference            
in order to say,                

398
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,241
"I'm talking about              
this segue right here".         

399
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,944
So, I'm gonna call              
this my sad segue.              

400
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,982
Then I'm gonna do the exact     
same thing here for happy.      

401
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,350
I'm gonna just show             
detail on that one.             

402
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,419
I'm gonna inspect that segue.   

403
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,421
See, there's our sad one.       

404
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,688
Notice that when                
you pick a segue,               

405
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,724
it shows you what               
it's segueing from.             

406
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,093
If I pick this one, it shows    
it seguing from the other one,  

407
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,160
so we know which one it is.     

408
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,429
So this is the happy one, and   

409
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,933
then we'll have our             
little worried segue.           

410
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,034
Where's that one?               

411
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,704
It's right there, worried.      

412
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,538
Okay, so that's it.             

413
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,242
So we've created these segues,  
put them in the, we'll put it   

414
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,577
into split view first,          
then we created the segues.     

415
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,479
And now when you click          
on those buttons,               

416
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,783
it's going to segue to this     
detail and in fact in a split   

417
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,219
view it replaces the one        
that's there with a new one.    

418
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,554
Remember that segues            
always create a new one,        

419
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,923
Don't forget that, that segues  
always create a new one.        

420
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,792
Something easy to forget.       

421
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,660
Especially in the split view,   
it looks like,                  

422
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,661
" it just changed the one       
that was already there".        

423
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,099
But no, it actually just        
completely replaced that        

424
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,134
detail segue by doing that.     

425
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,271
If we run this it               
it's gonna look like            

426
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,540
it doesn't didn't even work.    

427
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,409
Even though we hooked           
these segues up,                

428
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,545
it looks like it's just         
not doing anything, watch.      

429
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,681
Okay, so is he sad, happy,      
worried, nothing is happening.  

430
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,417
Absolutely nothing is           
changing over here.             

431
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,553
Now, what's interesting is      
it is in fact seguing, and      

432
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,455
it is replacing that.           

433
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,291
The only problem is,            
we didn't prepare that thing    

434
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,127
to show the right emotion       
before it showed, so            

435
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,030
it is just showing              
the neutral emotion.            

436
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,432
It's creating a new MVC, but    
it's just showing neutral,      

437
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,303
because it has not been         
prepared to be onscreen.        

438
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,038
We have to go back to the       
emotions view controller here,  

439
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,976
and do this prepare for segue,  
and prepare that destination    

440
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,681
detail view controller to       
do what we want it to do.       

441
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,549
Let's get rid of some           
of the comments here,           

442
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,217
just to make our code           
a little cleaner.               

443
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,551
And get rid of that, as well.   

444
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,053
Actually, we can even           
get rid of that.                

445
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,588
Okay, so                        
here's our prepare for          

446
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,690
segue with this extra           
argument sender,                

447
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,494
which I'll also talk            
about in a little bit.          

448
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,195
So what do we do when           
we prepare for segue?           

449
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,164
There's usually two really      
important piece of information  

450
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,533
we need when we're preparing    
to segue to an MVC.             

451
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,170
One is we need to know which    
segue, tha's the identifier.    

452
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,739
The other one we need to        
know is what is the new MVC     

453
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,542
that this system                
just created for                

454
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,810
us that we're                   
supposed to prepare.            

455
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,380
Both of these things            
are found inside this           

456
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,349
argument right here, this       
segue, this UIStoryboardSegue,  

457
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,484
if we ALT click on it.          

458
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,319
Can't get it.                   

459
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,654
Sorry about that,               
here we go, on this guy.        

460
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,956
We have the storyboard segue,   
and                             

461
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,457
if you'll look in               
the documentation for it,       

462
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,659
you'll see that it doesn't      
have a lot in there.            

463
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,163
But one important thing is the  
destination view controller,    

464
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,398
and one is the identifier       
of the segue.                   

465
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,300
This is also the source,        

466
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,135
which would be the emotions     
view controller.                

467
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,472
That's really just              
got the information             

468
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,075
that we need to                 
prepare this thing.             

469
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,212
Let's go and first get the      
destination view controller.    

470
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,382
I'm gonna say let               
destinationViewController       

471
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,685
equal the segue's destination.  

472
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,956
So I've got that                
view controller.                

473
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,625
Now that is a type UI view      
controller, if I alt-click on   

474
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,061
that, you'll see it's           
type UI view controller.        

475
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,797
That's because segue is this    
generic UI stroyboard thing,    

476
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,199
it doesn't know anything        
about face view controllers,    

477
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,268
EmotionViewController,          
anything like that.             

478
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,670
So, we're gonna have to         
actually use that casting       

479
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,305
mechanism with as.              

480
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,375
Remember that as casting that   
we did with Any, in AnyObject?  

481
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,209
We're gonna have                
to do it here,                  

482
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,045
because this                    
destinationViewController       

483
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,214
better darn well be a face      
view controller, or             

484
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,383
I don't know how                
to prepare it.                  

485
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,018
That's the only thing           
I know how to prepare,          

486
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,487
this emotion for us,            
so it'd better be that.         

487
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:30,760
So I'm gonna say, if I can let  
a FaceViewController equal      

488
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,932
the destinationViewController   
as, and                         

489
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,870
I'm gonna do it conditionally   
here, a FaceViewController.     

490
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,272
Then, I'm good to go.           

491
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,676
So now remember, this as kinda  
conditionally checks to see if  

492
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,912
it's possible for this to       
be a FaceViewController.        

493
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,015
And if it's not, my             
preparer's gonna do nothing.    

494
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,784
And it's gonna let that         
destination view controller     

495
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,484
appear unprepared,              

496
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,953
because it doesn't              
know how to prepare it.         

497
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,989
Cuz we only know how to         
prepare, (at least so far in    

498
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,025
our app), we only know how to   
prepare a FaceViewController.   

499
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,562
Okay, in fact some would        
say don't use, as, with,        

500
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,596
if let, here.                   

501
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,666
Just use as exclamation point,  
and make your program crash if  

502
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,336
you try to segue to something   
you're not expecting.           

503
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,172
Cuz again, you'll find          
it when you're debugging        

504
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,974
before you ship your product.   

505
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,642
So I can see the argument for   
that.                           

506
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,313
But we'll make it so we'll      
just ignore it, if we can't     

507
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,816
convert that destination        
to a face view controller.      

508
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:29,353
Alright, so now let's           
check the identifier.           

509
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,655
One thing about the identifier  
is someone might have           

510
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,323
forgotten to set it             
in the storyboard.              

511
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,592
So I'm gonna do                 
an if let on it.                

512
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,696
if let identifier =             
segue.identifier.               

513
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,699
Cuz this segue.identifier       
right here,                     

514
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,967
you can see is                  
an optional string.             

515
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,336
So it might be not set,         
in the storyboard.              

516
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,540
So I'm checking to make sure    
that it is in fact set.         

517
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,309
And now I need the expression,  
the facial expression,          

518
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,211
that I'm gonna set              
in this space for,              

519
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,114
this is where I'm gonna         
do the actual preparing.        

520
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,617
And I could do a little         
switch, or an if then, else,    

521
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,254
if then, else here on all       
the different segues: sad,      

522
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,621
happy, worried.                 

523
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,825
But I'm imagining that "        
my app might have 20 or         

524
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,259
30 emotions someday".           

525
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,328
As such, I wanted to do         
something a little more         

526
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,498
extensible, similar to what we  
did with the calculator brains  

527
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,034
operation, which is I'm         
going to create a private       

528
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,569
little dictionary here          
called Emotional Faces.         

529
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,139
And it's going to a dictionary  
that has Strings as the keys,   

530
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:27,177
and Facial Expressions Facial   
expressions, FacialExpression.  

531
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,846
Oops, sorry this was            
supposed to be colon            

532
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,750
FacialExpression as             
the values.                     

533
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:39,656
I'm even gonna just put         
the values in right here.       

534
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,191
So this is just                 
a little dictionary.            

535
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,695
This string is gonna            
be the identifier here          

536
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:50,133
that comes back,                
the name of our segue.          

537
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,436
And the FacialExpression is     
gonna be the facial expression  

538
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,306
that I want to use there.       

539
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,507
What's it complaining           
about here?                     

540
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,577
Cuz I didn't have               
any in there.                   

541
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:00,678
Yeah, cuz we have               
nothing in here.                

542
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,145
So let's put some               
things in here.                 

543
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,214
Let's do sad.                   

544
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,083
What's a good facial            
expression for sad?             

545
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,050
Well let's create one,          

546
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,423
a facial expression where       
the eyes are probably           

547
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,626
closed eyes, and                
the mouth is in a frown.        

548
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,628
That sounds pretty              
sad all around.                 

549
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,830
And then for happy,             

550
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,000
it'd probably be the facial     
expression with the eyes open   

551
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,504
and we'll let the mouth in      
a big smile, of course.         

552
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,705
And I think that worried,       

553
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,440
I looked at a few               
facial expressions.             

554
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,177
I thought, worried, the best    
thing that looks like that was  

555
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:40,984
eyes open, and the mouth kind   
of in a, a little smirk.        

556
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,521
That face, for some reason to   
me, looks a little worried.     

557
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:45,889
Now I've got this table,        

558
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,825
which I can add more            
things to over time.            

559
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,827
And all I have to do is make    
a new segue for it, and         

560
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,298
have the identifier             
match the string here.          

561
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,734
Now, I might have an            
identifier that's not in here,  

562
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:02,139
so I'm gonna say if I can let   
the expression I want equal     

563
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,143
My emotionalFace is here,       
sub the identifier.             

564
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,511
So I'm looking it up there.     

565
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,246
But it might come back nil      
cuz we know that if we          

566
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,181
look something up in            
dictionary it's not there,      

567
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,082
it will come back nil.          

568
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,150
So that time we're              
doing if let.                   

569
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,952
By the way, look at this        
I have, if let this,            

570
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,588
if let that, if let this.       

571
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,623
And you can imagine to having   
four or five of these, and      

572
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,924
you start getting really deep,  
and                             

573
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,560
the code is really              
kinda messy.                    

574
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,028
You can actually just           
do these with commas.           

575
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:28,398
You can just put right here,    
this one, and then a comma,     

576
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,768
and then this one,              
and then a comma.               

577
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,737
So you can put as many of       
these things as you want.       

578
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,907
And not just lets, you know,    
if let comma, let comma, but    

579
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,276
also other expressions too,     
other things.                   

580
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,013
Like, it's almost like an       
ampersand kind of expression.   

581
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:43,647
And then makes it so            

582
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,716
that I don't need all           
these curly braces.             

583
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:49,520
I can just use this one         
top level curly brace.          

584
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,622
Now I have the expression.      

585
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,023
Here is where I'm               
gonna do the prepare.           

586
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,494
I'm gonna say                   
FaceViewController,             

587
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:02,232
prepare yourself by             
making your model,              

588
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,703
the expression equal            
this expression                 

589
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,874
that I just looked              
up in that table.               

590
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,576
So that's the actual prepare.   

591
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,245
That is where I am preparing    
this new MVC that it            

592
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,781
created, this brand new         
FaceViewController I just       

593
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,882
created with the segue.         

594
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,317
I'm preparing it to             
do what it does.                

595
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,251
So let's see if that works.     

596
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,953
The face should                 
be prepared now.                

597
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,357
When it gets created,           
we should see a face.           

598
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,191
The right face.                 

599
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:30,995
Okay, so here it is.            

600
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,162
Let's try.                      

601
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,030
Woo-hoo, happy.                 

602
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,967
Well, it looks a little         
worried, and sad.               

603
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,605
Now, let's see how happy we     
are, though, on an iPhone.      

604
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,876
Because we know that on         
an iPhone, it's kinda small.    

605
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,445
Split View, not really enough   
room for a Split View.          

606
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,781
So what's gonna happen with     
this storyboard on an iPhone?   

607
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,815
Let's find out.                 

608
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,854
Okay, well, here we go,         
Sad, Happy, Worried.            

609
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,890
Excellent, let's see Happy.     

610
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,892
All right, we're happy.         

611
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,460
Well, now we're not so          

612
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,496
happy because we can't          
get out of here.                

613
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,131
We got this happy face but      
I can't get it back.            

614
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,968
Let's try going, well, even in  
landscape, no Split View, so    

615
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,738
now there's no way to get back  
to pick any other expression.   

616
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,706
So in the iPhone, you get       
to pick one expression and      

617
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,308
you're done, and                
that's the end of the app.      

618
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,210
You have to quit                
the app now because, or         

619
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,544
turn your phone off, I guess.   

620
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,446
There's absolutely              
nothing you can do.             

621
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,647
You're stuck.                   
I guess you can make            

622
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,381
the eyes blink.                 

623
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,851
So this is not a very good      
app on the iPhone, obviously.   

624
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,185
That's about it.                

625
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,620
So what are we gonna do?        

626
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,755
Since we have no                
Split View on the iPhone,       

627
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,892
(you actually can have a Split  
View on the iPhone by the way,  

628
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,628
but you have to do a special    
stuff to kinda enable it.       

629
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,064
But by default                  
the Split View doesn't work.    

630
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, of course,                
Apple understands that.         

631
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,470
That Split View is not          
very good for iPhones.          

632
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,205
iPhone Plus is by the way,      
it does work, and               

633
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,739
I'm gonna show you              
that in a moment.               

634
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,207
They know it's not that good.   

635
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,943
So if you go back to            
your storyboard here.           

636
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,211
We're gonna go back             
to our storyboard,              

637
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,415
and we're gonna look at this.   

638
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,750
And we're gonna say,            
hmm, well, on iPhone,           

639
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,688
I'd really like this UI to be   
navigation controller instead,  

640
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,722
not a Split View.               

641
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,558
Navigation Controller where     
when I click on this emotion    

642
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,593
it chose the face by            
sliding it on top, but          

643
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,895
I'll have a back button so      

644
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,430
I can go back,                  
pick a different one.           

645
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,031
It'll slide it on top and       
I can hit back,                 

646
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,233
you see what I mean, so         
I can go back and forth.        

647
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,768
And you can do that             
incredibly simply.              

648
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,937
You just pick this view         
control right here, and         

649
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,139
go to editor.                   

650
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,241
Embed in                        
Navigation Controller.          

651
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,743
And it's gonna insert           
a Navigation Controller         

652
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,012
in the middle there, see that,  

653
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,281
how I put that Navigation       
Controller in there.            

654
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,351
And what's really cool is with  
the Navigation Controller you   

655
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,087
actually get a little title     
bar, and you can go straight    

656
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,089
here in interface               
builder if you want and         

657
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,191
put a title in there            
like maybe emotions.            

658
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,027
We could call it,               
it's the name of our app or     

659
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,928
that's what these are in        
this NVC rather, so             

660
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,497
I'll put a little title in      
there, and that's really cool.  

661
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:54,737
And so now when we run, I get   
my face coming up in neutral    

662
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,975
mode, and if I go back, now I   
can pick something like happy.  

663
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,844
Now one thing you might be      
interested in there is like,    

664
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,913
whoa, it came up                
in neutral mode.                

665
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,483
Instead of coming up on this    
page, you kinda would expected  

666
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,518
it to come up on this page.,    
wouldn't you?                   

667
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,019
And we actually made            
it extra credit for             

668
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,188
you to go to figure             
out how to do it.               

669
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,156
And what you need to            

670
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,258
do is something with            
Split View Controller.          

671
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,928
It's delegate, which I'm not    
gonna talk about the delegates  

672
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,297
until Wednesday, that's why     
we made it extra credit.        

673
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,299
But you're gonna use            
Split View's delegate and       

674
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,201
read the documentation,         
and you can make it so          

675
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,669
that it'll come up              
on either page.                 

676
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,872
Either on this detailed page    
or on this master page.         

677
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,909
But you can see that this is    
working great, in fact we've    

678
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,745
even got this nice little       
title bar up here, and we can   

679
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,315
switch back and forth between   
any emotions that we want.      

680
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,184
And let's go see what happened  
when we did that to iPad.       

681
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,187
Did we break the iPad?          

682
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:52,462
Let's hope we didn't break      
the iPad by doing that.         

683
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,497
Here we go.                     

684
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,431
It comes up.                    

685
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,532
There's the face.               

686
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,568
By the way, you can do          
Split Views in Portrait.        

687
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,602
You just slide out.             

688
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,539
You see, it slides out like     
a little shelf like that.       

689
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,875
Or you can rotate and           
see them side by side.          

690
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,044
And it's still working.         

691
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,747
So the iPad is                  
working just fine.              

692
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:11,715
Well, unfortunately,            

693
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,551
there's no zoom level           
that's a better zoom level.     

694
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,887
But the iPad has a title here.  

695
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,689
But it'd be really              
cool if there was               

696
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,958
a title over here, too.         

697
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,359
Like maybe this would say,      
sad and                         

698
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,194
if I hit happy it would say,    
happy over here.                

699
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,228
Wouldn't that be cool?          

700
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,497
To have a title on both         
sides of that, that's           

701
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,966
often in a Split View that we   
want, because you want kind of  

702
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,903
the balance between the two     
to have tittle on both sides.   

703
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,374
So no problem, let's just go    
back to our storyboard here,    

704
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,043
and select this                 
View Controller and             

705
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,446
embed it in                     
a Navigation Controller.        

706
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,983
And in fact, if we go here and  
look at an iPad.                

707
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,953
What it's gonna look like on    
iPad, especially in landscape?  

708
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:50,754
We'll see that,                 

709
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:54,090
ooh, this is looking what       
like exactly what we want.      

710
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,525
when it's in detail, its got    
a title bar, a title bar here,  

711
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,892
Look.                           
See,                            

712
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,061
title bars everywhere.          

713
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,596
It's fantastic,                 
this is gonna be great.         

714
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:05,602
Let's do it.                    

715
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,338
All right, look at that,        
title bar on the top.           

716
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:13,777
And, uh-oh, we broke it.        

717
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,545
What happened there?            

718
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,447
Why did we break that?          

719
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,816
Well, this has to do with       
the preparation piece.          

720
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,951
And I talked about this         
in the lecture last time.       

721
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,553
Because what prepare            
is doing is,                    

722
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,290
it's creating a new MVC here,   
and then we're preparing it.    

723
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,494
The problem is that now when    
it creates a new MVC here,      

724
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,494
what is the MVC?                

725
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,695
What kind of MVC is it?         

726
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,364
Anyone want to hazard a guess?  

727
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,732
Cuz it's not a face             
view controller                 

728
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:36,733
anymore, what is it?            

729
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,837
Yeah, it's a UI                 
navigation controller.          

730
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,305
That's the new MVC              
we're creating,                 

731
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,806
it has a faceView in it, but    

732
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,942
it's still a UI                 
navigation controller.          

733
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,578
So our code that                
we have back here.              

734
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,980
That's doing this prepare.      

735
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,916
It says,                        
if I can let the faceView       

736
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,552
equal the destination as        
a FaceViewController.           

737
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,354
Well, I can't do that           
because it's not.               

738
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,656
It's a UI navigation            
controller instead.             

739
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,624
And I'll show you that          
in debugging here.              

740
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,528
Let's go ahead and set          
a break point right here, and   

741
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,431
go back over here and           
pick one, like happy.           

742
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,498
Here it breaks.                 

743
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,833
And if we look at this          
DestinationViewController,      

744
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,270
those of you who came to        
the debugging Friday section.   

745
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,272
We didn't really go over        
this cool feature, but          

746
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,706
if you just mouse               
over a variable.                

747
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:17,540
You see how I just,             

748
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,043
I'm holding my mouse over       
DestinationViewController?      

749
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,378
You see it's                    
showing that there?             

750
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,479
There's two really              
cool buttons in there.          

751
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,382
You see this one                
looks like an i?                

752
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,385
And this one looks like         
the letter i for info.          

753
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,287
If you click the one that       
looks like a i, it'll actually  

754
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,191
show you that View Controller   
right there in the debugger.    

755
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,893
Which is kinda cool.            

756
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,062
And if you go over here and     
click the other little i,       

757
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,265
it'll show you                  
the class that it is.           

758
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,434
In this case, it's a UI         
navigation controller.          

759
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,103
And this works for              
all kinds of types,             

760
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,871
colors, even a map location.    

761
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,140
It'll show you a map with       
the location on there.          

762
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,910
So this little mouseover        
debugging thing is              

763
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,094
But anyway, we see that         
DestinationViewController       

764
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:56,211
really cool.                    

765
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,114
right there is a UI             
navigation controller.          

766
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,349
We know that's no good.         

767
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,950
So what are we gonna            
do about this?                  

768
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,352
Well, I'm gonna check for       
this case, okay?                

769
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,390
I'm gonna say, if I can let     
navigationController equal      

770
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:11,995
the destinationViewController   
as a UINavigationController,    

771
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,163
in other words,                 

772
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,200
if that destination is a UI     
Navigation Controller, then     

773
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,137
I'm gonna grab the visible      
ViewController out of it and    

774
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,607
use that as the                 
FaceViewController hopefully.   

775
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,911
So, I'm gonna say               
in this case I want             

776
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,347
the destinationViewController,  
which is this thing up here,    

777
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,149
which now it needs              
to be a var and so              

778
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,951
I'm gonna change                
its value here.                 

779
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,053
I'm gonna let that equal,       

780
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,591
the navigationController's      
visibleViewController.          

781
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,359
Okay, now this is great,        

782
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,062
visibleViewController is        
a really nice method and        

783
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,631
navigation control,             
it shows you whichever          

784
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,234
card stack is currently         
visible, exactly what I want.   

785
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,703
The only problem with it,       
however, is it returns          

786
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,439
an optional, because            
nothing might be visible in     

787
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,074
the navigationController        
right now.                      

788
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,876
Okay, you might have            
never put anything              

789
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,645
in the navigationController.    

790
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,547
So since that is an optional,   
I'm gonna have to give it       

791
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:08,551
some default value,             
and the default value,          

792
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,655
I'm just gonna say, just use    
the destinationViewController   

793
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,056
as is if I can't get            
the visible ViewController or   

794
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:14,925
the navigationController.       

795
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,862
So it's kinda a default to      
use what it already was.        

796
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,663
Basically, don't change it.     

797
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,234
So this little if is nice,      
because now my code works if    

798
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,170
it's in a navigationController  
or even if it's not.            

799
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,438
Because if it's not in          
a navigationController,         

800
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,574
this is gonna do nothing.       

801
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,540
That's going to fail.           

802
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,476
Alright, this as is             
not going to work.              

803
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,078
And we'll go straight           
down to checking                

804
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,079
if it's a FaceViewControllor.   

805
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,817
So if I later came along back   
to my storyboard here and       

806
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,385
eh, you know what, I don't      
really want the title on here.  

807
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,886
I decided,                      

808
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,055
And I took this                 
navigationController out        

809
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,891
of the picture, my code would   
still work, cuz my code works   

810
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,093
whether I'm going straight      
to a FaceController or          

811
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,598
through a                       
navigationController.           

812
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,734
Let's see if that indeed        
fixed our problem.              

813
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,305
Here we go, let's try it.       

814
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,509
Happy, yeah, worried, sad.      

815
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,611
Happy, we're happy              
that it's working.              

816
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,947
Okay, now we have this nice     
title bar at the top and        

817
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,515
we said, wouldn't it be cool    
if we could put a title, so     

818
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,382
let's do that.                  

819
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,184
Let's put a little title here,  

820
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,187
in fact the title I'm gonna     
put here is whichever button    

821
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,856
brought this MVC up.            

822
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,224
So if the sad button            
brought it up,                  

823
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,259
I'm gonna get its current       
title and put it up here,       

824
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,094
kinda like we did               
in the calculator.              

825
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,733
Look back to the sender and     
luckily prepare for segue,      

826
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,701
has the sender.                 

827
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,771
This is the thing that          
cause the segue to happen.      

828
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,239
Which is going to be            
one of those buttons.           

829
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,043
So right down here, I can just  
get the current title of this   

830
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,379
sender right here and           
set that to be the title.       

831
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,248
Now if you remember             
from the lecture about          

832
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,818
navigationController, the way   
that you                        

833
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,055
set things that appear when     
it's in a navigationController  

834
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,823
like the title,                 
you can also set the buttons,   

835
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,492
the back button                 
title you can set,              

836
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:58,094
or you can even put write       
buttons in the top.             

837
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:00,597
You do that with this thing     
called NavigationItem on        

838
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,297
UIViewController.               

839
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,266
So I'm gonna take               
the faceViewController's        

840
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,836
navigationItem, which,          
by the way the navigationItem,  

841
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,471
you can just kind               
of think of it as               

842
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,142
a bag of goodies that only      
UINavigationController uses.    

843
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,777
And it only looks in            
that bag of goodies             

844
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,079
when this ViewController,       
the faceViewController,         

845
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,548
is the visible ViewController   
in the NavigationController.    

846
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,683
Then it looks in this bag of    
goodies and you can see that    

847
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,084
there's a lot of things         
in the bag of goodies,          

848
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,554
like leftBarButtonItem,         
rightBarButtonItems, and        

849
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,190
of course the title.            

850
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,091
Which is what I                 
want to set here.               

851
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,127
I want to set the title of      
the navigationController        

852
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,762
when this thing is visible.     

853
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,496
And I'm gonna send it,          

854
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,733
I want to send it to the        
sender's current title, but     

855
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,135
I can't quite do that.          

856
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,069
Why can't I do that?            

857
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,138
Why is that not gonna work?     

858
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,242
This.                           

859
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:46,943
See any problem?                

860
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:50,680
Yeah, this is Any.              

861
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,650
And Any does not                
understand any messages.        

862
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,485
Because it doesn't              
know what it is.                

863
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:59,388
So we have to take this any     
and turn it into a UI button.   

864
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:06,296
And we do that by saying this,  
sender as the UIButton.         

865
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,164
Now we could almost             
send current title.             

866
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,799
The only problem is this.       

867
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,100
What is this type of,           

868
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,372
what is the type of, if I can   
select it, this expression?     

869
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,239
What's its type?                

870
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,512
No one wanna guess              
on this one?                    

871
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,982
No one?                         

872
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,917
It's an optional, right?        

873
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,821
Because "as?" returns           
an optional, so this is         

874
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,557
an optional, so we can't send   
an optional current title.      

875
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,394
We need to either               
exclamation point it, or        

876
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,663
a little safer,                 
we could optional chain it.     

877
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,532
Because we know that optional   
chaining is just going to       

878
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,336
ignore the rest of this         
expression if that happened to  

879
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,236
not be a button.                

880
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,638
And this as returned nil,       

881
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,775
because this couldn't be        
turned into a button.           

882
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,944
So we'll just optional chain    
in which case the title here    

883
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,981
will be set to nil, because     
this whole thing will be nil    

884
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,483
if this optional                
chaining doesn't happen.        

885
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,284
And that's okay,                

886
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,920
because we look at the title    
of a navigation item.           

887
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,988
It's an optional.               

888
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,322
So we can send it to a nil.     

889
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,859
And then this will, it will     
have no title up there.         

890
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,394
I intentionally put             
this thing in here for          

891
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,229
lot of things going on here.    

892
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,431
We have the any cast going on.  

893
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,533
We have optional                
chaining going on here.         

894
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,068
We use the navigation item.     

895
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,570
So there is a lot in            
this line of code.              

896
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,138
So make sure you kind           
of understand what's            

897
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,406
all the pieces going on there.  

898
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,177
Now we should be getting        
hopefully the title of          

899
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,647
the button appearing as the     
title on the right-hand side.   

900
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,782
So happy, sure enough,          
there's happy.                  

901
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,051
Worried, there's worried.       

902
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,819
Sad, happy.                     

903
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,855
And of course if we rotate,     

904
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,156
we're still getting             
the title up there.             

905
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,191
We can slide this thing         
out and pick sad,               

906
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,594
and it happens back there.      

907
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,496
Slide that thing out            
of the way if we want.          

908
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,496
Rotate back.                    

909
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,165
How about iPhone 7?             

910
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:54,971
Let's see if we've              

911
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,408
broken that.                    

912
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,378
It appears with this split      
views detail coming up first    

913
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,812
in this neutral mode.           

914
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,214
We'll go back to emotions.      

915
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,216
Pick Happy.                     

916
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,151
Sure enough, it's setting that  
title fine there as well.       

917
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,386
If we go here.                  

918
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,155
Since it's an iPhone,           
can't do split view,            

919
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,659
it's still working fine in      
navigationController mode.      

920
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,929
Let's go look at a 7 Plus.      

921
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,765
There is a 7 plus which         
is kind of a high breed         

922
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,568
between iPhone 7 and an iPad.   

923
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,003
And in portrait mode,           

924
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,839
an iPhone 7 plus works          
just like an iPhone.            

925
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:30,406
So it's gonna be the            

926
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,707
navigationController back and   
forth.                          

927
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,111
But in landscape,               
it'll work like an iPad.        

928
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,614
Okay, so obviously an iPhone    
7 plus in portrait mode,        

929
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:42,184
it is not big enough to do the  
slide-out thing like an iPad    

930
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,621
does in portrait mode, but      
in landscape mode it is, so     

931
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,758
let's make it so                
this thing fits.                

932
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,527
That's close                    
enough to fitting.              

933
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,662
I'll go small here.             

934
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,398
All right, so this is a plus.   

935
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,266
And you can see it comes        
up in portrait mode.            

936
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,536
It's acting like                
it's an iPhone.                 

937
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,471
See that, okay?                 

938
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,371
It's just doing that.           

939
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,341
But look what happens if        
I go to landscape mode,         

940
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,209
I get a split view.             

941
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,078
Tha's working fine.             

942
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:15,518
So see how we built in the      
storyboard this hybrid UI and   

943
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,154
it works on all the different   
kinds of devices.               

944
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,856
No matter whether they          
control with you or             

945
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,290
not it'll default               
go back to using                

946
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,859
navigationController,           
whatever.                       

947
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,594
And the only thing we           
had to do in our code           

948
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,029
as a concession to the          
cross-platform is checking for  

949
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,864
that navigationController and   
only for                        

950
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,367
the thing we were segueing to.  

951
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,239
Back to the slides.             

952
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,915
Our next topic here is          
the View Controller Lifecycle.  

953
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,351
Now, everything                 
has a life cycle,               

954
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,987
even we have a life cycle:      
we're born, we live our lives,  

955
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,289
things happen, and we die.      

956
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,224
Well, that happens to           
a View Controller as well.      

957
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,093
It's just born, things happen   
to it, and then it dies,        

958
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:58,995
it leaves the heap.             

959
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,230
That's what happens             
on its death.                   

960
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,533
Why do we care about the view   
controller lifecycle?           

961
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:07,637
Because we often wanna          
do things at various key        

962
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,373
inflection points               
in its lifetime.                

963
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,175
The start of a lifecycle        
is really simple.               

964
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,678
It gets initialized,            
and 99.99% of                   

965
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,815
the time a view controller is   
coming out of a storyboard.     

966
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,086
Its initializer is this         
special initializer coming out  

967
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,387
of a storyboard.                

968
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,621
In your reading assignments,    

969
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,156
I actually explained            
how this works.                 

970
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,226
But we don't usually override   
the initializer of a view       

971
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,695
We're going to use the other    
ways we know to initialize      

972
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,096
controller.                     

973
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,198
each variables.                 

974
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,401
I'm not even gonna talk about   
how to make one in code.        

975
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,236
Because we just,                
just don't do that.             

976
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,471
You can see why, right?         

977
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,773
Because view controller         
is complicated.                 

978
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,441
It's got all the UI, the        
buttons, and all the stuff.     

979
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,912
You're generally not gonna      
be making that in code.         

980
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,648
What happens then               
after it's created?             

981
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,750
The next thing that happens     
is if it's being segued to,     

982
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,819
it gets prepared.               

983
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,188
Like when we prepared the       
FaceView Controller there by    

984
00:40:59,257 --> 00:40:59,956
setting it to model.            

985
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,490
That's the next thing           
that happens after it's         

986
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,426
initialized.                    

987
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,329
The next thing that happens     
is its outlets get set.         

988
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,196
So, for the FaceView,           

989
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,366
its FaceView outlet got         
set after it got prepared.      

990
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,670
Then, it appears and            
disappears on screen.           

991
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,541
In our example right there,     
the master                      

992
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,343
was constantly appearing and    
disappearing on screen.         

993
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,979
Every time, on the iPhone, for  
example, that we hit happy or   

994
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,481
sad, it would disappear.        

995
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,149
And the face one                
would come on.                  

996
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,252
And then, we'd hit back and     
it would reappear.              

997
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,922
By the way, when that happens,  
the face one didn't disappear.  

998
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:33,723
Well, it disappeared and        

999
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,425
it also got thrown              
out of the heap.                

1000
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,526
Because we reuse                
the things we segue to.         

1001
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,662
But that master,                
we don't segue to it.           

1002
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,632
It sits there as the master in  
the split view all the time.    

1003
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,533
But it's appearing and          
disappearing on screen.         

1004
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,169
So that's a big thing that      
happens its lifecycle.          

1005
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,237
Another thing that happens      

1006
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,407
during the life time of it is   
it's changing its orientation.  

1007
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,342
We're rotating the landscape.   

1008
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,210
We're on a iPad and             

1009
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:58,013
we're sliding it out as         
a tray in portrait mode and     

1010
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,082
then we rotate to landscape     
and it's sitting on the side.   

1011
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,785
So it's changing its shape.     

1012
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,187
Even the face view of the iPad  
when we're in portrait,         

1013
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,623
it's big, tall and big.         

1014
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,391
But then we switch to           
landscape it's kind of more     

1015
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,592
like a square, and              
a little smaller.               

1016
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,628
So it's always                  
changing geometry.              

1017
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,831
And then it could be in a low   
memory situation as well where  

1018
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,899
we need to recovery             
some memory,                    

1019
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,368
this almost never happens,      
but I have to mention it.       

1020
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,404
It's really maybe not even      
part of the view controller     

1021
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,273
lifecycle but it's a good       
place to talk about it,         

1022
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,608
cuz it's not really             
that important.                 

1023
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:31,714
Let's talk about                
the messages that               

1024
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,383
are sent to invoke methods      
in your view controller         

1025
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,086
when these various              
things happen.                  

1026
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,623
So you already know about       
your outlets being set.         

1027
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,625
And you can watch that          
with your did sets,             

1028
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,959
the property observer,          
did set.                        

1029
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,594
And you already know            
about preparing,                

1030
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,996
I just showed you about that.   

1031
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,164
So after those two              
steps are done,                 

1032
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,834
you're gonna get this message,  
viewDidLoad.                    

1033
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,936
Super important method.         

1034
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:57,106
You're only gonna ever receive  
it once in the lifetime         

1035
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,007
of a viewController.            

1036
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,878
And it's really where           
you're gonna put                

1037
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,780
almost all of your              
initialization.                 

1038
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,950
For example, a lot of times     
here's where you'll call your   

1039
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,554
update UI method, the thing     
that updates your UI from your  

1040
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:16,025
model, very often you're gonna  
call that in viewDidLoad.       

1041
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,728
Cuz now your model is set       
because it got prepared         

1042
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,330
probably, and your outlets      
are set because this is how it  

1043
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,299
always happens after            
outlet setting.                 

1044
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,534
Now, one thing not to           
do in here though.              

1045
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,136
Very careful,                   
listen carefully.               

1046
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,805
Do not do geometry-based        
things in viewDidLoad.          

1047
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,173
Because when                    
viewDidLoad happens,            

1048
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,711
you have not yet had your       
final geometry established.     

1049
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,814
You don't quite know if         
you're portrait, landscape,     

1050
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,649
what device you're on,          
you don't know yet.             

1051
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,353
So do not do things with        
your bounds in viewDidLoad.     

1052
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,890
Many of you will make this      
mistake so perk up those ears.  

1053
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,924
Do not do that.                 

1054
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,759
I'm gonna show you other        
methods in the new controller   

1055
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:54,663
lifecycle for doing that but    
do not it in viewDidLoad.       

1056
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,199
The next thing I said to you,   
appear and disappearing.        

1057
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,902
You're always appearing and     
disappearing on screen.         

1058
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,071
When you appear,                
you're gonna get two messages.  

1059
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,306
The first is viewWillAppear.    

1060
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,410
And that's sent to you before   
you're actually on screen, but  

1061
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,613
just very very                  
soon going to be,               

1062
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:13,315
guaranteed you're going         
to be on screen soon.           

1063
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,951
So, what is                     
viewWillAppear for?             

1064
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,653
What are you going to do        
in a view will appear?          

1065
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:21,023
Well one thing is if there's    
anything that changes in your   

1066
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,891
model when you're               
not on screen,                  

1067
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,060
maybe your model is             
a network database or           

1068
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,496
something and                   
it's changing on the screen.    

1069
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:30,332
Then when view appear happens   
you're going to usually update  

1070
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,901
your UI from your model.        

1071
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,537
So maybe you wouldn't do        
update UI in viewDidLoad,       

1072
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,539
you might do it here.           

1073
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,540
That's if it could change       
when it's not onscreen.         

1074
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,475
A lot of MVCs,                  

1075
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,743
their model only changes        
when they're onscreen, so       

1076
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,312
you wouldn't have to            
do anything here.               

1077
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,181
But if your model can be        
changed out from under you      

1078
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,316
while you're off screen,        
then you, when you reappear,    

1079
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,685
obviously you wanna show the    
current state of your model.    

1080
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,920
So that's a good one.           

1081
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,821
Another thing you might         
do in viewWillAppear            

1082
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,557
is start something expensive.   

1083
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,060
Because in viewDidLoad you're   
not guaranteed that you're      

1084
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,628
ever gonna come on screen.      

1085
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,264
There are MVCs that             
occasionally get loaded up,     

1086
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,500
but then the user clicks        
away somewhere else and         

1087
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,868
you never get shown on screen.  

1088
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,102
But if viewWillAppear happens,  

1089
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,404
you know you're                 
going on screen.                

1090
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,073
So here you could kick          
off something expensive.        

1091
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,608
Especially kick off             
a thread that goes and          

1092
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,309
does something expensive        
in the background.              

1093
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,745
Cuz we're gonna talk about      
multithreading next week and    

1094
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,314
you're gonna see that anything  
that takes any amount of time   

1095
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,584
or energy on the part of        
the processor or the network,   

1096
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,619
you're gonna wind up            
doing a separate thread.        

1097
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,455
So you might kick off such a    
thread here in viewWillAppear.  

1098
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,323
There's also                    
an another method,              

1099
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,727
viewDidAppear which gets into   
after you're fully on screen.   

1100
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,596
The animation to get you        
on screen is on screen so       

1101
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,598
you're there.                   

1102
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,899
And what would you do here?     

1103
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,668
There's usually not             
a lot to do here.               

1104
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,438
You might start                 
an animation though.            

1105
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,374
You've got some MVC that        
has some animation going.       

1106
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,677
And it doesn't make any         
sense to start it before it     

1107
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,578
So once it gets on screen       
then you start it going.        

1108
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,412
gets on screen.                 

1109
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,214
ViewWillAppear and              
viewDidAppear happen so         

1110
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,117
close together, it's probably   
not gonna save much to wait     

1111
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:56,752
until viewDidAppear to          
start the animation,            

1112
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,354
but eh,                         
a lot of people will do that,   

1113
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,356
just to kind of for             
clarity of programming.         

1114
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:01,924
And then, of course,            

1115
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,060
you can disappear, and          
get the same thing there,       

1116
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,495
a viewWillDisappear and         
a viewDidDisappear.             

1117
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,999
One thing you notice in all     
of these view controller        

1118
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:12,701
lifecycle is that               
I'm calling super.              

1119
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,402
You see that?                   

1120
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,405
super.viewWillDisappear, and    
I did it for                    

1121
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:20,509
superViewDidLoad, and           
superViewWillAppear.            

1122
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,312
All of them, all of the view    
controller lifecycle methods,   

1123
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,681
always call super.              

1124
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,083
You always wanna give your      
super class chance to do it.    

1125
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,253
You'll see actually in          
the demo why you do that.       

1126
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,254
Always do that.                 

1127
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,589
Always do super there.          

1128
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,060
So in viewWillDisappear,        
a lot of times here you're      

1129
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,663
undoing the things you          
did in viewDidAppear.           

1130
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:42,030
Like if you had                 
an animation going,             

1131
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,065
you're gonna stop it here,      

1132
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,400
because you're                  
about to disappear.             

1133
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,870
Here you might also             
start some cleanup.             

1134
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,138
Your MVC disappeared, and       

1135
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,641
so, if you allocated some       
resources or something that     

1136
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,344
you don't need, network         
connection open or something.   

1137
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:58,080
That only makes sense to be     
open while your MVC is on,      

1138
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,749
then here is a good place       
where you can shut it down,     

1139
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,052
and there is a did              
version of this as well.        

1140
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,555
A lot of times people           
look at viewDidAppear and       

1141
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,691
viewWillDisappear as matched,   
you know, one undoes            

1142
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,295
the other, and then the same    
thing with viewWillAppear and   

1143
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,498
viewDidDisappear, those         
are gonna undo each other.      

1144
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,736
I still haven't talked          
about geometry until now.       

1145
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,904
You don't want to be doing      
geometry in viewWillAppear.     

1146
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,007
Your geometry actually          
probably is set                 

1147
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,042
in viewWillAppear, but          
you shouldn't count on that.    

1148
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,311
You shouldn't do geometry       
in the view wills and           

1149
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,313
did appears and                 
disappears either.              

1150
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:35,050
Geometry changes: there's       
methods especially for it.      

1151
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,686
One thing to consider is, you   
almost never need to write any  

1152
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:40,122
code when your                  
geometry changes.               

1153
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,023
That's cuz you                  
have auto layout.               

1154
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,792
I mean,                         
look at the app I just wrote.   

1155
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,129
I've got that sad, happy,       
worried block of text, and      

1156
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,497
when I rotate it it             
stays in the middle.            

1157
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,632
I didn't have to write          
any code for that.              

1158
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,568
And even more                   
complicated UI's.               

1159
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,336
You're usually using            
auto layout and                 

1160
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,804
it's doing it for you.          

1161
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,206
So most time you                
don't need any code.            

1162
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,242
But if you did feel like        
you needed to do some code      

1163
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,411
Let's talk a little bit         
about how you do that.          

1164
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:06,982
There's two methods,            
viewWillLayoutSubviews and      

1165
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,550
viewDidLayoutSubviews.          

1166
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,019
And these are sent to you.      

1167
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,656
In between these being sent     
to you, Autolayout happens.     

1168
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:18,994
So if you wanna get involved    
in the geometry change of your  

1169
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,898
view, before                    
Autolayout starts,              

1170
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,399
you can do it in view           
will layout subviews.           

1171
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,534
If you wanna wait until         
Autolayout does what it does    

1172
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:26,568
and then you wanna              
get involved,                   

1173
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,037
you can do it in                
viewDidLayoutSubviews.          

1174
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,474
So when did these get called?   

1175
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,378
When a bounds of                
a view changes,                 

1176
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,714
all of its subviews might       
have to be moved around.        

1177
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,582
Maybe the view                  
is know tall and                

1178
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,052
thin, instead of short and      
wide.                           

1179
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,521
It's views are gonna have to    
be moved to be in the right     

1180
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,490
place, just like again we       
rotated the emotions thing and  

1181
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,559
we need to move that            
stack view up or                

1182
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,762
all over a little bit           
sustained in the middle.        

1183
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,197
That's primarily                
what's going on here,           

1184
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,334
that's why this method is       
called viewWillLayoutSubviews.  

1185
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,668
Its bounds changed and          

1186
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,837
now all its subviews            
need to be laid out.            

1187
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,307
What about the things the view  
actually draws itself like      

1188
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,207
the face?                       

1189
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,842
That has nothing                
to do with this.                

1190
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,743
That's a view thing.            

1191
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,647
That face view, when the        
bounds change, if it's content  

1192
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,950
mode is redraw like we set it   
for the face view, it's draw    

1193
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:18,720
method's automatically gonna    
get called at the new bounds.   

1194
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,455
So you don't have to            
do anything there.              

1195
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,224
So viewWillLayoutSubviews,      

1196
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,659
is what happens,                
when you have subviews.         

1197
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,596
This happens at the view        
level, so views have a method   

1198
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,199
for laying out their subviews,  
called layoutSubviews.          

1199
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:33,102
Subviews, and the               
ViewController also gets to     

1200
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,905
find out when its view,         
and by this I mean the var      

1201
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,241
view in ViewController,         
you remember what that var is?  

1202
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,410
That's that top level view.     

1203
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,212
There's a var for               
that in your ViewController,    

1204
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:46,615
it's saying that view is going  
to layout its subviews, and     

1205
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,718
that happens when that top      
level view changes, usually     

1206
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,488
due to rotation but other       
things can change it as well.   

1207
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,728
One thing about these methods   
is you should expect that they  

1208
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,198
may be called all the time.     

1209
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,299
Don't try to anticipate when    
they're going to be called.     

1210
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,735
Just, whenever they're called,  
you do what you're supposed,    

1211
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:07,702
you're supposed to do,          

1212
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,372
and they might be called        
repeatedly with the same        

1213
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,373
bounds.                         

1214
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,375
So the bounds might not         
actually have changed,          

1215
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,578
because this is not called      
view bounds changed this is     

1216
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:18,280
called viewWillLayoutSubviews   
and viewDidLayoutSubviews.      

1217
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,682
And there are other things      
besides bounds changes that     

1218
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,152
might cause that top-level      
view to have to layout it's     

1219
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,020
sub views.                      

1220
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:26,488
So expect this to be            
called fairly often and         

1221
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:29,458
you should always               
react to it correctly.          

1222
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,026
Even if it's called             
repeatedly with the same        

1223
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:31,927
bounds or whatever.             

1224
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,297
Now, auto rotation,             

1225
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,466
the bounds changing by          
rotating the device, actually   

1226
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,603
has a couple of little extra    
pieces of interest to it.       

1227
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,473
The most notable is animation.  

1228
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,942
So normally when you rotate     
it's just going to be           

1229
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,011
ViewWillLayoutSubviews and      
everything's just going to,     

1230
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,949
auto layout's going to happen,  
everything is happening fine.   

1231
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:57,519
However that changes, all       
those changes are animated.     

1232
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,289
If you look closely when        
you rotate your device, all     

1233
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,892
the views are kind of flying    
across to their new location.   

1234
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,394
It's really kinda               
cool actually.                  

1235
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:07,630
They're being animated.         

1236
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,698
They don't just pop             
appear in the new place,        

1237
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,100
they slide over.                

1238
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,068
Well, you can participate       
in that animation,              

1239
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,336
now we haven't talked           
about animation.                

1240
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,905
We will in about three weeks.   

1241
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,407
But you can participate         
with this method,               

1242
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,576
ViewwillTransition to           
size with coordinator.          

1243
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,246
And that coordinator has a      
little closure you can set on   

1244
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:27,016
it that will cause some         
animation you want to do        

1245
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:31,052
to happen alongside             
the rotations animation.        

1246
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,822
So if you want to animate       
moving some user doing          

1247
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,224
something else that doesn't     
happen automatically for you,   

1248
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,959
which most stuff does           
with autolayout,                

1249
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,728
you can do that here            
with this method.               

1250
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:48,337
Low-memory:                     
didReceiveMemoryWarning         

1251
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,671
will be sent to your            
view controller when            

1252
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,840
the system's low on memory,     
it's trying to get some back.   

1253
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,409
This almost never happens.      

1254
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,311
I just can't remember the last  
time this happened because      

1255
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,379
the devices have so             
much memory these days.         

1256
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:01,116
Usually if this happens         
though, you wanna pay           

1257
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,419
attention because you're        
using a lot of memory.          

1258
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,055
If the system is sending this   
to you, either you are or       

1259
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,922
some other app is               
using a lot of memory.          

1260
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,926
By the way, if you are an app   
that uses a lot of memory, and  

1261
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,094
you don't keep it               
under control,                  

1262
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,263
the system has the right        
to just kill you.               

1263
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,531
Just kill your app.             

1264
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,400
And it will do it, absolutely.  

1265
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,901
Even if you're in               
the background,                 

1266
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,805
if you've allocated a ton of    
memory and you're being a bad   

1267
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,909
citizen they just kill you off  
to get your memory back what    

1268
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,679
kinda memory would you free     
up if you got this method.      

1269
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,082
Let's say you had an image      
that's not currently on         

1270
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,284
screen, and you can create      
it from a file on disk.         

1271
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,321
We haven't really talked about  
this, but your phone has        

1272
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,625
permanent storage,              
flash memory, and you have,     

1273
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,627
let's say a JPEG image,         
you can just recreate it.       

1274
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,461
Well, you would definitely      
release that here.              

1275
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,529
Cuz it's not on-screen, and     

1276
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:48,997
you can create it real          
fast from the disk,             

1277
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,165
so there's no reason            
to keep it around.              

1278
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,967
So that's something             
you could release.              

1279
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:55,003
Basically any memory that       
you can quickly recreate.       

1280
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,205
Or that is not currently        
on-screen, and                  

1281
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,808
you can create it when          
that comes back on-screen.      

1282
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:02,177
That's a good                   
thing to release.               

1283
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,678
But only big things.            

1284
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,947
Don't release little            
tiny 100 byte things.           

1285
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,984
No, we're talking images,       
sounds, videos,                 

1286
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:13,355
big ol' things.                 

1287
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,556
There's one other               
little thing:                   

1288
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,992
it's not part of the            
UIcontroller life cycle, but    

1289
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,662
every single object that comes  
out of a storyboard: views,     

1290
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:24,165
view controllers, everything    
gets sent awakeFromNib and      

1291
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,634
they can send it pretty early.  

1292
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:27,936
Like right as                   
soon as they come               

1293
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,938
out they get sent               
awake from nib.                 

1294
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,974
Now you can't use it to like    
satisfy the requirement that    

1295
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,811
all vars are initialized.       

1296
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,947
But you can use it do early,    
really early initialization.    

1297
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,350
For example remember I          
mentioned about you want your   

1298
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,819
split view controller to        
come up showing the face or     

1299
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,855
come up showing the emotions    
instead of showing the face?    

1300
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:48,257
In your calculator,             

1301
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,524
it would come up                
showing the calculator,         

1302
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,828
instead of the calculator's     
graph, and                      

1303
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,863
I said you needed to do that    
by setting the delegate.        

1304
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,932
This delegate of                
the SplitViewController,        

1305
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,500
that's something you            
might wanna do to make          

1306
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,702
get that delegate               
involved early.                 

1307
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,738
We'll talk about                
delegates on Wednesday.         

1308
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,108
So awake from nib, rarely       
used and sometimes overused.    

1309
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,878
I would say if you could put    
it in another method like view  

1310
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,713
did load or                     
view will appear or view.       

1311
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,181
Did layout put it there first.  

1312
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,717
Don't put it in away fromNib,   

1313
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,185
that's kind of a last           
resort place to put things.     

1314
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,722
It's probably better            
than overriding in it.          

1315
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,824
But that's the only             
thing it's better than.         

1316
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,661
So here's the summary of        
the entire view controller      

1317
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,561
lifecycle.                      

1318
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,232
You can instantiated,           
created out of the storyboard.  

1319
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,734
You get awake from              
nib sent to you.                

1320
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:33,969
Segue prep happens.             

1321
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:36,471
Somebody prepares you if        
you're being segued to          

1322
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,407
which most MVC's are.           

1323
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,508
Outlets get set.                

1324
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,176
Your face view, and             
your calculator.                

1325
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,412
It's your display and           
things like that get set up.    

1326
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,015
ViewDidLoad gets called.        

1327
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:49,551
Again, with viewDidLoad,        
look at all the things that     

1328
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,453
happened by the time            
viewDidLoad gets called.        

1329
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,255
It's a great place to           
put initialization.             

1330
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,058
You enter kind of               
the normal life cycle           

1331
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,460
where you're getting            
appearing and disappearing.     

1332
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,413
disappearing with the the will  
and did appear and disappears.  

1333
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,298
Appearing and                   

1334
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,501
Along the way, and              
at any time actually,           

1335
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,070
even before viewDidLoad,        
you can get these sent to.      

1336
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,571
Although that would be rare.    

1337
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,472
But anytime you can be,         

1338
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,308
actually I'm not sure you can   
get it before viewDidLoad.      

1339
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:16,144
Take that back But any time     
when view will appear and       

1340
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:19,314
disappear is happening,         
whether you're on-screen or     

1341
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,050
not, you could get              
viewWillLayout subviews and     

1342
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,854
viewDidLayout subviews sent to  
you, auto-layout happening.     

1343
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,389
By the way, why would you       
ever be sent these methods      

1344
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,591
when you're not on-screen?      

1345
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,327
Well, the system might be       
preparing to animate you        

1346
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:33,429
coming on-screen.               

1347
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,364
When the system                 
animates things,                

1348
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,135
one of the ways it can do       
it is having you draw one       

1349
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,537
orientation, have you           
draw in the other, and          

1350
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:45,307
then it kind of moves the bits  
from one to the other.          

1351
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:47,142
That's one kind of              
animation can do.               

1352
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,977
So you might be off screen,     
and it's asking you for         

1353
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:49,544
both of those.                  

1354
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,712
So it sends you this twice,     

1355
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,547
once to get this                
orientation and draw, and       

1356
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,950
then once to get this into      
orientation and draw.           

1357
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,017
And then when you               
come on screen,                 

1358
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,786
it animate you from             
one to the other.               

1359
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,022
So, that's why you can          
get this at any time            

1360
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,757
on screen or off.               

1361
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,995
Also at any time you could      
get a low memory warning.       

1362
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,197
And then you're done.           

1363
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,033
It leaves the heap when it      
goes off screen if it was       

1364
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:18,706
segued to, as long as it's not  
itself segued into something.   

1365
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,709
But when it's done              
it gets thrown out.             

1366
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,278
Okay, so                        
I'm gonna show you a demo that  

1367
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,247
will make all of this           
a lot more concrete.            

1368
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,417
Let me go through the rest      
of this in case I don't get     

1369
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,984
back to the slides,             
I think we will, because        

1370
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,588
I think we're gonna have time   
to do this other, topic.        

1371
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,123
After the demo,                 
I'll come back and              

1372
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,025
start to talk about memory      
management, hopefully.          

1373
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,995
On Wednesday, extensions,       
protocols, delegation,          

1374
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,463
that thing I was telling        
you you'll need to know for     

1375
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,932
your split view thing, if you   
wanna do that extra credit.     

1376
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,034
And we'll start talking         
about scroll view,              

1377
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,302
more complicated object.        

1378
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,137
On Friday,                      
important one on Friday,        

1379
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,805
if you want to do               
the extra credit,               

1380
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,241
about performance in            
the calculator graph.           

1381
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,377
So you definitely wanna         
show up for that one.           

1382
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,813
And then next week we'll        
start into multi threading,     

1383
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,615
table view,                     
a whole bunch of cool stuff.    

1384
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,084
Alright, so                     
let's do this demo here.        

1385
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,788
I'm gonna go to our face view,  
same thing we were just in,     

1386
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,156
this face it app.               

1387
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:10,959
And I'm gonna drag in a little  
piece of code I wrote,          

1388
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,428
which I'm gonna show you here.  

1389
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:17,299
Let's get out navigator back    
here, put this in here.         

1390
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:18,600
So I'm just gonna               
drop this in here.              

1391
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,202
By the way when                 
you drag in code,               

1392
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:22,537
you probably want to do         
copy items, if needed.          

1393
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,639
Otherwise, it's gonna be kind   
of linked to the other one,     

1394
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,874
if you change it in             
the other place,                

1395
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,242
it's gonna be changing here.    

1396
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,712
Can be kinda causing            
unexpected results often.       

1397
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:32,781
I put this in here.             

1398
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,782
Let's look at this little       
class I just dropped in here,   

1399
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,951
it's called                     
VCLLoggingViewController.       

1400
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,054
It's a subclass of              
UIViewController.               

1401
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:44,292
Logging view controller and     
it logs the VCL methods.        

1402
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,661
View controller                 
life cycle methods.             

1403
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,431
So it basically just            
overrides every single one.     

1404
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,435
View will appear, view layout   
subviews away from nib.         

1405
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:55,436
It even tells you when          
it left the heap.               

1406
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,372
It's overriding init here, and  

1407
00:57:57,441 --> 00:58:00,942
it just prints out where it,    
what happened.                  

1408
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,210
So it just sits there           
on the console,                 

1409
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,179
printing out everything         
that happened.                  

1410
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,147
It's a little bit cool,         

1411
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,048
because it shows you            
the instance of each of them.   

1412
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,351
So you can see instances        
coming and going,               

1413
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,054
as they get segued to,          
and then come off.              

1414
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,390
It also kinda indents it over   
time, so you can, when you      

1415
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:18,259
click some, you can see         
a bunch that happen together.   

1416
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,196
Now the way we're gonna use     
this is we're just gonna make   

1417
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:26,868
this class be the super class   
of both of our controllers.     

1418
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:29,304
So we're gonna make that into   
a VCL login view controller.    

1419
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,674
And we're gonna make this into  
a VCL login view controller.    

1420
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:36,411
And right there, you can see    
why we always wanna call super  

1421
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,713
in all of our view              
control methods.                

1422
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,648
Cuz if we did any of            
these view controller           

1423
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,850
life cycle methods, and         

1424
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,385
we were subclassing from        
VCL login view controller,      

1425
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,788
if we don't call super,         
it not gonna get logged.        

1426
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,890
And it's not unusual to         
come along later and            

1427
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,759
pop the different kind of view  
controller in between you and   

1428
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:52,894
UI view controller.             

1429
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,264
Some view controller that does  
something like logging or       

1430
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,732
something else.                 

1431
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:58,867
All right, so that's it.        

1432
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,501
That's all we need to           
do to make this work.           

1433
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,369
So I'm gonna go ahead and       

1434
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,137
run, we'll stick                
with iPhone 7 plus.             

1435
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:07,009
Let's go ahead and              
get the console up here.        

1436
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:11,546
Here we go.                     

1437
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,414
This came up, and               
we're already seeing a lot of   

1438
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,783
view controller lifecycle       
stuff happening here.           

1439
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,852
All right, we have our          
EmotionsViewController and      

1440
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,920
our FaceViewController,         

1441
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,623
these two view                  
controllers get emitted.        

1442
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,458
They come out of                
the storyboard, and             

1443
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,426
they initialize with            
this init with coder.           

1444
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,594
And that's the one that things  

1445
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:27,862
come out the interface          
builder.                        

1446
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:31,033
They both get awakeFromNib,     
you see that?                   

1447
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,435
And then the emotions one,      
first, gets viewDidLoad.        

1448
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,371
Then it gets                    
viewwillAppear(animated =       

1449
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,990
That's because we're just       
starting up our app, so it's    

1450
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:40,541
false).                         

1451
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,678
not sliding in on a navigation  
controller or something.        

1452
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,848
It's just appearing,            
so it's not animated.           

1453
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,919
Then notice, it gets laid out   
twice, both at the same size,   

1454
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:54,622
295 x 414,                      
which is this size right here.  

1455
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,624
It gets look, done twice.       

1456
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:57,642
Some animation,                 
I don't know wha's going on,    

1457
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:58,592
Again, Why?                     

1458
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,494
why i's doing that.             

1459
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:00,662
But you don't care,             

1460
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,466
just be careful that those      
layouts can happen repeatedly.  

1461
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,902
Now here is face view           
controller, it gets loaded.     

1462
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,838
It's told it's going to         
appear, it will appear.         

1463
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,274
And it gets laid out once.      

1464
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:17,479
Then they both get DidAppear,   
and now they're on screen.      

1465
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,181
So this is kind of exactly      
what you'd expect.              

1466
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:24,252
Now let's rotate this thing,    
so                              

1467
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,821
that we go to portrait mode.    

1468
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,090
And we're not gonna             
see the master.                 

1469
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:33,428
We're only gonna see            
the details here.               

1470
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,765
So here,                        
the master disappears.          

1471
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,334
So this is, see the dash?       

1472
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,570
That's what happened            
when I did that rotation.       

1473
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,839
So this is all the new stuff.   

1474
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,374
Now notice that                 
the EmotionViewController       

1475
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:47,142
immediately is                  

1476
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,678
told that there's going to      
be a rotation animation.        

1477
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,049
And it gets a chance to         
participate in the animation.   

1478
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:58,719
The FaceView gets re-laid       
out in its new size.            

1479
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,322
It's tall now, so               
it gets laid out, so            

1480
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,124
it gets                         
viewWillLayoutSubviews.         

1481
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:05,927
The Emotions Controller is      
told that it will disappear.    

1482
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,164
So it's going to disappear.     

1483
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,766
Notice the animated faults,     
that's cuz the animation in     

1484
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,403
that rotation case is handled   
by the rotation animation.      

1485
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,373
So it's not sliding in or       
out but it is getting animated  

1486
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,109
out of there but                
by the rotation animation.      

1487
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:21,943
Then we have                    

1488
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,212
the face view controller        
being laid out again.           

1489
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,952
Now we're getting               
the EmotionsViewControllers     

1490
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,487
being getting it's chance to    

1491
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,389
animate alongside               
the rotation, right here.       

1492
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,693
We've got a couple of           
spurious things here from       

1493
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,829
the iOS new UIKit,              
we can get rid of those.        

1494
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:46,134
And then the animation ends     
for both of those controllers.  

1495
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,069
Make sense?                     

1496
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,604
Now I'm gonna click this        
emotions thing, and             

1497
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:52,941
go back to the master and       
watch what happens.             

1498
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,743
Okay, so                        
we go back to the master.       

1499
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:57,812
FaceViewController was          
told it would disappear,        

1500
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,382
of course, cuz it did,          
does disappear.                 

1501
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,718
The emotions one is told        
that it will appear,            

1502
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:05,553
it's laid out in this           
new tall arrangement.           

1503
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,154
And then the face view          
controller told it,             

1504
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,623
was disappeared and             

1505
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,759
the emotion view controller     
was told it disappeared.        

1506
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,829
Now let's go, bring one back.   

1507
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,633
You can see, look,              
FaceViewController(2).          

1508
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,835
A new FaceViewController        
was created,                    

1509
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,138
because we segued to it,        
so it created it.               

1510
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,139
You see that?                   

1511
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,676
And in fact, if we go back and  
forth, we'll see that we're     

1512
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,413
getting new                     
FaceViewControllers each time,  

1513
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,148
FaceView three.                 

1514
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,984
And look at the old one's,      
FaceViewController              

1515
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:39,254
3 left heap, they're            
gonna thrown out beneath.       

1516
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:43,725
So I'll be posting              
all this code.                  

1517
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,693
You can drop this               
logging view controller.        

1518
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,162
Actually you can drop it        
into your calculator,           

1519
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,899
if you wanted, and try and      
watch it bring things on and    

1520
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,033
off screen etc.                 

1521
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,439
Let's go back to                
the slides here.                

1522
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,243
Let's talk about                
our next topic,                 

1523
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:06,214
which is memory management.     

1524
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,983
We've kind of avoided           
this topic so far but           

1525
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,918
i's an important                
topping topic.                  

1526
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,154
If you have a reference         
counted data structure,         

1527
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,822
a class tha's                   
the only reference,             

1528
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,458
well i's not the only data      
counting reference structure    

1529
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,994
as you'll see in a second.      

1530
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:22,263
But if you have a reference     
counting thing, and it lives    

1531
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:26,167
in the heap, how do you         
know when to get rid of it?     

1532
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:29,136
We saw in that demo I just      
did the faceview controller     

1533
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,505
left the heap.                  

1534
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,507
How did it know to              
leave the heap?                 

1535
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:35,810
Because we don't do anything    
to tell it to leave the heap.   

1536
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,645
We just are using it, and       

1537
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:40,147
when we're not using it         
anymore it goes away.           

1538
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:43,217
Well, of course, you know       
one way to make things leave    

1539
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,419
the heap, it's called           
garbage collection.             

1540
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,021
How many people know what       
garbage collection is,          

1541
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,890
have heard that phrase before?  

1542
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,225
So, more than half of you,      
so that's good.                 

1543
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:55,330
Runtimes like Java,             
do garbage collection.          

1544
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,065
It's a perfectly                
fine way to do it.              

1545
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,767
It involves going               
through the heap and            

1546
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,602
kind of marking the use         
of everything and               

1547
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,804
then sweeping through and       

1548
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,740
getting rid of stuff            
that's not used.                

1549
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,376
Swift doesn't do any of that,   
it uses a totally different     

1550
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,613
mechanism called                
Automatic Reference Counting.   

1551
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,815
Basically every time            
you create a var or             

1552
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:16,551
a let that points to            
something in a heap,            

1553
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,754
Swift goes over somewhere and   
makes a mark.                   

1554
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:21,322
And another one,                
there's another one.            

1555
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,025
And it keeps track of it until  
there aren't anymore of those   

1556
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,426
lets and vars.                  

1557
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,629
It erases them as               
those vars go away.             

1558
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,664
Like, maybe they're             

1559
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,066
a var in another object         
that leaves the heap.           

1560
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,735
So now that var is no longer    
pointing to this other object.  

1561
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,438
So it's basically keeping       
track of all the vars unless    

1562
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,539
they point to                   
something in the heap.          

1563
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,475
And when no one                 
points to any more,             

1564
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,477
it lets it out of the heap.     

1565
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,045
Now why is this good?           

1566
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:45,880
It's very predictable           
memory usage.                   

1567
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:48,249
You know exactly when things    
are gonna leave the heap.       

1568
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,519
They leave the heap as soon as  
nobody points to them anymore.  

1569
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,821
What's also great about it,     
is that you almost have to      

1570
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,389
do nothing in your              
code to make this work.         

1571
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,657
It's just automatic.            

1572
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,293
That's why it's called          
automatic reference counting.   

1573
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,262
You can get involved however.   

1574
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,131
And the way you can get         
involved is by influencing      

1575
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,501
the way that arc works.         

1576
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,003
And you do that with            
three keywords in Swift         

1577
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,072
called strong,                  
weak and unowned.               

1578
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,876
And I actually told you and I   
was gonna tell you about these  

1579
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,445
back in the very first          
lecture, you remember when we   

1580
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,081
made the outlet for             
display, it was weak.           

1581
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,615
Remember that?                  

1582
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,850
That's this weak right here.    

1583
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,619
So the strong,                  
weak and unknown.               

1584
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,287
So let's talk about             
each of those.                  

1585
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:29,390
Strong, this is normal          
reference counting.             

1586
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,692
If you have a strong var or     

1587
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,629
strong let to something in      
the heap, then that thing       

1588
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,398
will stay in the heap,          
as long as that var exists,     

1589
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,968
it's strongly holding           
that thing in the heap.         

1590
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,102
This is the default.            

1591
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:45,773
You don't even ever type this   
keyword, cuz it's the default.  

1592
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:49,244
Every var, unless you say it's  
weak, is going to be strong.    

1593
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:51,913
So it's simple.                 

1594
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,448
Works magically.                

1595
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:54,215
Then there's weak.              

1596
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,652
Now weak is a really            
interesting keyword in Swift.   

1597
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,188
When you put weak               
on top of a var,                

1598
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,193
it says, well I'm looking at    
this thing in the heap but      

1599
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,762
if no one else is               
interested in the heap then     

1600
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,298
you can throw it out of         
the heap and set me to nil.     

1601
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,034
So weak only works              
with what type?                 

1602
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,372
>> Optional.                    
>> Optional, exactly,           

1603
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,907
cuz you have to be              
able to set it to nil.          

1604
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,376
So only optionals can be weak.  

1605
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,514
So the display outlet           
in your calculator,             

1606
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:31,486
it was a weak UI label          
exclamation point,              

1607
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,722
which means it was              
an optional UI label.           

1608
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:35,523
And so it was weak.             

1609
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,357
So what does that mean?         

1610
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,326
That means if                   
that UI label for               

1611
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:41,929
some reason ever,               
everyone else threw it out,     

1612
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,167
then that display var would     
be set to nil, automatically.   

1613
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:50,138
Now, why does that display      
var set itself weak?            

1614
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,672
Why does it say weak?           

1615
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,442
Well, because the thing it's    
pointing to is that view        

1616
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,376
hierarchy.                      

1617
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,778
The view hierarchy that has     
all the calculator buttons and  

1618
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,013
the display and all in there.   

1619
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:02,149
And if that view hierarchy      
stops pointing to it,           

1620
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:06,020
that means it's gone, and       
so the display outlet is no     

1621
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:09,457
longer interested in trying     
to set numbers in it, and       

1622
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,393
things like that,               
because it's gone.              

1623
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,297
So, when you have a var that    
points into a very strongly     

1624
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,033
held data structure that you    
completely depend on for        

1625
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:21,702
your semantic meaning           
to mean anything                

1626
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,670
then you can make it weak.      

1627
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:28,442
And so we're perfectly fine if  
that display gets at the nil    

1628
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,679
if the view hierarchy no        
longer points to that UI label  

1629
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,815
because it's probably           
meaningless at that point.      

1630
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,053
So we don't usually             
use weak that much.             

1631
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,989
A lot of times we'll use        
it to keep from having          

1632
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,159
one object pointing to          
another strongly and            

1633
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,361
having that object point        
back to this one strongly.      

1634
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,829
That's very bad situation.      

1635
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,365
That's called a memory cycle.   

1636
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,101
That's gonna keep both of       
those objects in the heap       

1637
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,304
forever, because there's        
always gonna be a strong        

1638
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,806
pointer to each of them.        

1639
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,108
Cuz they each point             
to each other.                  

1640
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,776
So either of them can           
leave the heap and              

1641
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:03,210
free up their pointer           
to the other one.               

1642
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,245
Unless you set one,             

1643
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:06,647
like they're optionally set     
one to nil or something.        

1644
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:07,882
So if you had                   
a situation like that,          

1645
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:10,018
you could use weak to break     
that cycle by having one        

1646
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,487
of the pointers be              
a weak pointer.                 

1647
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,089
That would allow it             
possibly to happen.             

1648
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,024
And I'm gonna show you          
an example here of another      

1649
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,928
case where making that kind of  
memory cycle is super easy.     

1650
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:21,929
And that's bad that it's easy.  

1651
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:23,865
Because you can get the cycles  
where things are being          

1652
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,099
held in memory.                 

1653
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:27,034
The last one is unowned.        

1654
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,471
Unowned means, "Hey, automatic  
reference counter, Don't worry  

1655
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,708
about this one, I'll take care  
of it, I'll make sure I never   

1656
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,477
use it when it's not pointing   
to something in the heap".      

1657
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,746
This one can be                 
quite dangerous.                

1658
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,381
We almost never use this.       

1659
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,916
It would really only be used    
to break one of these memory    

1660
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,586
cycles, and it can only be      
used to make a memory cycle     

1661
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:48,723
when you're 100% sure           
that you know who's             

1662
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,292
using that pointer, because     
automatic reference counting    

1663
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,694
is not going to be counting     
it as a strong reference, and   

1664
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:55,296
it's also not going to check.   

1665
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:58,099
And so if you use it, and       
that thing you're pointing to   

1666
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:01,702
has left the heap,              
it will crash your program.     

1667
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:02,970
So that's what unowned is.      

1668
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,206
Now, since unowned just         
crashes your program if you     

1669
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:06,474
try to use it and               
it's not in the heap,           

1670
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,108
it's not an optional.           

1671
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,344
There is no setting to nil,     

1672
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:11,479
it's always assumed             
to not be nil.                  

1673
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:12,980
And if it's ever nil and        

1674
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,716
that code executes,             
bam, it crashes.                

1675
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,018
So unowned,                     

1676
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:18,987
I will show you how we          
use unowned in a moment.        

1677
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,890
It's only to break cycles.      

1678
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:26,927
Now, closures have              
an interesting attribute        

1679
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,530
about them, which hopefully     
you read about in your reading  

1680
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,867
assignment, that really has     
a lot to do with this strong,   

1681
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,369
weak, and unowned business.     

1682
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,839
And then what goes on inside    
of a closure is that a closure  

1683
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:44,678
captures all the references     
inside of it.                   

1684
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,983
It captures them, and makes     
a strong pointer to them.       

1685
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:51,219
So, if you reference            
something inside a closure,     

1686
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,954
remember what closures are.     

1687
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:53,821
Open curly braces, and          

1688
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,557
we have some code in            
there like we had in our        

1689
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,093
operations table of             
our calculator brain.           

1690
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,294
So inside that closure,         

1691
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,597
inside those curly braces you   
reference some reference type,  

1692
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,066
something that's in the heap.   

1693
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,968
That closure is itself          
a reference type.               

1694
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,737
It lives in the heap and        

1695
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,573
it's going to keep a strong     
pointer to the other thing.     

1696
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:15,142
And the problem comes if that   
other thing has a strong        

1697
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,378
pointer back to that closure.   

1698
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,846
Because now you have            
a memory cycle.                 

1699
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,148
The closure is keeping that     
object in and that object that  

1700
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,350
has a pointer to the closure    
is keeping the closure in.      

1701
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,119
They are keeping each           
other in memory.                

1702
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,422
Now neither of them             
can ever leave.                 

1703
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,392
It's called a memory cycle and  
it's really easier memory       

1704
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,928
cycle in a closure,             
as you'll see.                  

1705
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,463
So, here is an example          
with our calculator.            

1706
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,466
Let's say I added a new method  
to my calculator brain called   

1707
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,469
addUnaryOperation where         
I allow people to               

1708
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,072
add new operations to           
my operations table.            

1709
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,941
Right now we don't allow that   
because it's all private.       

1710
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,344
But let's say I had a public    
method, addUnaryOperation.      

1711
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,846
You could add a new operation.  

1712
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:52,680
Wouldn't that be cool?          

1713
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,449
Yeah, that would be cool.       

1714
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:56,917
Let's see what it               
would like for                  

1715
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,953
a view controller               
that wanted to, for             

1716
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,523
example, add a unary operation  
which is square root, but       

1717
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,192
it turns the display green.     

1718
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:06,794
I call it green square root.    

1719
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,963
So, what will it look like to   
write something like that?      

1720
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:11,598
Well, I would call              
addUnaryOperation,              

1721
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,967
give it some symbol.            

1722
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,636
I'm gonna have it look like     
a green square root but         

1723
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,139
it's pushing it there but it's  
kind of what it looks like.     

1724
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,742
And it would pass in            
the operation for               

1725
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,110
green square root.              

1726
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,213
Now just a couple of cleanup    
things before that here.        

1727
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,783
This is that operation          
argument to addUnary            

1728
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:29,816
operation.                      

1729
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:34,755
And as we know,                 
we could use trailing           

1730
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:38,626
closure syntax here to get      
rid of that operation colon.    

1731
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,328
We just close it, and           
since the closure is the last   

1732
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,464
argument, we just put it after  
the end of the parenthesis.     

1733
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,033
Remember that from when I       
talked about filter and map?    

1734
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,102
So we could do that here,       
so that cleans it up.           

1735
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,871
Also, of course,                

1736
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:55,709
we could let Swift infer the    
types here and just use $0.     

1737
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,311
Everyone understand             
this code up here?              

1738
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,446
Could not be simpler, right?    

1739
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,282
I'm just adding this Unary      
operation, green square root.   

1740
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,851
And all it's doing is setting,  
this, I'm doing this from       

1741
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,387
my view controller, so it's     
setting the displays color to   

1742
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,021
green And                       
returning square roots,         

1743
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,458
the same as square root, but    
the display is just green.      

1744
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:11,859
Now, this will not compile.     

1745
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,528
Why will this not compile?      

1746
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:16,263
Let us look and see why not.    

1747
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,035
It's because it's gonna say     
you have to explicitly say      

1748
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:25,072
self dot there because I want   
you to understand that you      

1749
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:32,113
are capturing a strong pointer  
to yourself In this closure.    

1750
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:37,618
So that in case somehow         
you point to this closure,      

1751
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,353
which our view                  
controller does,                

1752
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,388
because our view controller     
has the calculator brain,       

1753
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,224
calculator brain has            
the operations table,           

1754
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,493
the operations table            
has this closure in it.         

1755
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,363
So I'm pointing to              
that indirectly                 

1756
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:52,333
from my View Controller, and    
it's pointing now back at me.   

1757
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,702
Self dot,                       
it's gonna capture self.        

1758
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:57,371
Self is a pointer to myself,    
my own View Controller.         

1759
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,338
Now I've created                
a memory cycle.                 

1760
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,007
Yep.                            

1761
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,476
Everyone understand             
what's going on there?          

1762
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:03,810
The closure lives in the heap.  

1763
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,279
The View Controller             
lives in the heap.              

1764
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,547
They're now pointing            
to each other.                  

1765
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,049
The closure's pointing          
directly to the view            

1766
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,717
controller and the view         
controller's indirectly         

1767
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,453
pointing to the closure         
through the calculator brain,   

1768
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:13,721
through the operations table.   

1769
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,092
This operation                  
they've gotta add in.           

1770
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,794
So let's talk about how         
we break this cycle             

1771
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:20,628
because since it's so           

1772
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:23,231
easy to do we need to be able   
to break it easily as well.     

1773
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,167
Well first thing                
we're going to do,              

1774
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,670
is we're going to create        
a special local variable.       

1775
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,973
So closures allow you           
to before the word in,          

1776
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:36,177
put open square bracket,        
a list of special variables.    

1777
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,479
These are just little local     
variables that just live for    

1778
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,580
this closure only.              

1779
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,650
Now these variables             
can have any name.              

1780
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,353
And you can set them to any     
value you want that's in        

1781
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,554
the scope here.                 

1782
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,922
So I've created a local         
variable called me and          

1783
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,691
I've set it equal to self.      

1784
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:54,161
So that's fine,                 
"me" is a local variable,       

1785
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,430
it's going to be of             
type view controller,           

1786
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,866
it's added to myself and so     
now I can use me in there and   

1787
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,702
you already used self so        
I've replaced self with me.     

1788
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,704
That doesn't help break         
our cycle at all.               

1789
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,442
However, what if I              
made that me variable,          

1790
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,711
not self but me, be unowned?    

1791
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,615
If I make that                  
thing be unowned,               

1792
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:17,652
now it's not going to           
create that strong pointer.     

1793
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,488
Because me It lives             
in the heap, but                

1794
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,024
automatic reference counting    
doesn't reference count it, so  

1795
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,592
it pays no attention to it.     

1796
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,294
Now what that                   
would mean though,              

1797
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:30,397
is that if this code            
were executed, and me,          

1798
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,133
which is the view controller    
cuz I set it equal to self, if  

1799
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,570
the view controller were out    
of the heap, this would crash.  

1800
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,838
But that's perfectly            
fine here.                      

1801
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:40,207
Do you see why that's fine?     

1802
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,511
When would a calculator         
operation ever be executed      

1803
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,846
if the view controller          
is not even in the heap?        

1804
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:46,814
It's impossible.                

1805
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,450
The view controller provides    
all the UI that causes this     

1806
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:50,284
thing to be executed.           

1807
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:52,286
There's absolutely no           
way that can happen, so         

1808
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:55,122
it's perfectly fine             
to say unowned here.            

1809
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,891
And that would break            
the cycle nicely.               

1810
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,194
But let's talk about            
another way to do it.           

1811
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,396
By the way, it doesn't          
have to be called 'me',         

1812
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,531
I could say 'unknown            
self' equals 'self'.            

1813
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
In other words, the local       
variable can shadow or          

1814
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,804
have the same name as the more  
global variable 'self'.         

1815
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,972
So I could say unknown          
self equals self, and           

1816
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,508
in fact if I just say unknown   
self that's the same as         

1817
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,344
saying 'unknown                 
self equals self.               

1818
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:18,245
So this is a lot of times       
how we'll break a cycle,        

1819
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,815
we'll say unknown self and      
that basically means inside     

1820
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,385
this enclosure, you can assume  
that self is in the heap.       

1821
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,190
Now let's talk about            
breaking it with weak.          

1822
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:32,293
So I can also say weak self.    

1823
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,062
And that means that self is     
now a local variable in this    

1824
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,964
closure that's an optional      
view controller.                

1825
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,935
And if it's not, if that view   
controller is not in the heap,  

1826
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,872
this variable self, which is    
different from the global cell  

1827
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,107
is going to be nil.             

1828
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,875
So this is a safe               
way to do it.                   

1829
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,111
But of course since             
it's an optional,               

1830
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,147
we can't just say               
self.display,                   

1831
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,617
right there we have to say      
optional chained self.display.  

1832
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:58,385
So that if this                 
closure executes and            

1833
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:01,288
the view controller is not in   
the heap, self question mark    

1834
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:04,792
will be nil and it will not     
execute the rest of that line.  

1835
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,093
It'll still return              
the square root,                

1836
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,695
but it won't turn               
the thing green because         

1837
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,031
this view controller's          
not even there.                 

1838
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,867
So that's how we can            
use weak to do it.              

1839
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,604
And sometimes we use weak,      
and we could create anther      

1840
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,071
variable, and                   
often we'll do this.            

1841
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,907
This might be the most common   
way to do it right here,        

1842
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,877
is to say weak                  
weakself equals self.           

1843
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,045
And so,                         
weakself is this Argument,      

1844
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,514
is this local variable          
inside the closure only         

1845
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,216
that is a weak                  
version of Self.                

1846
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,819
Okay, that's kind of clearer    

1847
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,687
what's going on than if         
you just say weakSelf.          

1848
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,290
Then it's like self is          
an optional, it's weird.        

1849
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,791
Now at least you have           
a different variable called     

1850
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,927
weakSelf, all right.            

1851
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,130
Okay, so let's go in            
the last couple minutes and     

1852
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,464
just do this in                 
the Calculator.                 

1853
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,334
Let's do exactly what I talked  
about, this green square root.  

1854
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:50,437
I'm just gonna go back          
to our calculator here.         

1855
01:16:50,506 --> 01:16:52,173
Where is our calculator?        

1856
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:53,474
Here somewhere.                 

1857
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:54,708
There it is.                    

1858
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:55,943
We haven't seen this            
code in a while.                

1859
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,011
You've seen it a lot.           

1860
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,712
I haven't seen it               
in a long time.                 

1861
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,946
All right, so                   
here's our calculator, and      

1862
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:03,483
I told you I'm just going       
to add this new func.           

1863
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,886
Add unary operation.            

1864
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:11,124
And it's going to take          
the symbol that we              

1865
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,660
want to have it be this in      
there, so it's gonna be like    

1866
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,564
the green square root, or       
whatever we call it there.      

1867
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,033
And actually, probably we       
wanna say something like named  

1868
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,902
symbol, that's probably be      
a little better naming there,   

1869
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,136
and that's a string.            

1870
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,439
And it's going to               
take an argument,               

1871
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:28,976
let's make more space here,     
which is the operation.         

1872
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:31,111
We don't really need to have    
an external name because we're  

1873
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:36,416
probably gonna use trailing     
closure syntax there to do it.  

1874
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,887
But this is just a Double,      
returns a Double function.      

1875
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:43,256
Hopefully, you're all very      
familiar by now with using      

1876
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,493
a function just as              
a type right there.             

1877
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,061
So we have this                 
UnaryOperation.                 

1878
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,564
And all we need to do           
to make this work is            

1879
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,366
we have our operations          
table down here.                

1880
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:57,304
I'm just gonna say              
operations sub that symbol =    

1881
01:17:57,373 --> 01:18:00,541
Operation.unary operation,      

1882
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:04,978
where this operation            
is the argument.                

1883
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,680
I mean,                         
it couldn't be simpler.         

1884
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:09,383
Really, that was so simple      
because we built such a good    

1885
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,786
data structure here to store    
all of our operations.          

1886
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:15,388
Now notice we have              
an error here.                  

1887
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,424
You see this has an error.      

1888
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:18,124
What's it saying?               

1889
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,660
Mark this method mutating.      

1890
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,895
Okay, why is that?              

1891
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:23,663
Well that's because we're       
changing this operations table  

1892
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,499
so of course that               
has to be mutating.             

1893
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:28,635
But that's not the only error,  
we've got another error.        

1894
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,837
What's this saying?             

1895
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:33,173
It's saying here that           
this parameter operation        

1896
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,508
Is "escaping".                  

1897
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:38,011
What that does that mean,       
it's escaping?                  

1898
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,613
Let's go ahead and fix it.      

1899
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:43,417
It puts this word in here,      
@escaping.                      

1900
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,753
Escaping means that             
this function,                  

1901
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:50,558
is escaping these               
curly braces.                   

1902
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,128
It is in fact escaping.         

1903
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,362
Where is it escaping?           

1904
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:56,497
It's jumping into here.         

1905
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,602
Anytime you have a function     
that you pass in, and           

1906
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,338
it gets put in some other data  
structure, in other words,      

1907
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:08,208
it escapes out of the curly     
braces of the method it's in,   

1908
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:11,344
you have to mark it escaping    
so that you understand and      

1909
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,682
swift understands that you      
are storing that somewhere.     

1910
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,750
And that's because it might     
create a memory cycle           

1911
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,785
if you do that.                 

1912
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,954
So fix it will automatically    
remind you about this so        

1913
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:22,790
you don't have to               
remember that so much.          

1914
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:24,691
We've got this nice             
cool new feature and            

1915
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,962
let's go to our view            
controller and add it.          

1916
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,431
Hey how about we                
use view did load.              

1917
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,201
Here's view did load,           
super dot view did load.        

1918
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,002
I never want to forget that.    

1919
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,738
So that's going to happen       
we're all initialized,          

1920
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,140
our outlets are set.            

1921
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,143
Let's just go ahead and call    
that addUnaryOperation here.    

1922
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:49,182
Let's call it brain             
addUnaryOperation.              

1923
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:50,984
Is that what I called it?       

1924
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:55,522
addUnaryOperation, I don't      
know why that's not,            

1925
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,357
there it did it.                

1926
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,692
It's just a little slow.        

1927
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,263
addUnaryOperation takes         
the symbol which is named.      

1928
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:04,631
And I'm gonna go ahead and      

1929
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:09,036
do that green exclamation       
point if I can find it here.    

1930
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,372
Where is that thing?            

1931
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,843
It's probably pictograph,       
maybe, no.                      

1932
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,712
Anyone know where               
that would be?                  

1933
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:20,814
Let's try, what's it called,    
checkmark or something.         

1934
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:21,948
There it is.                    

1935
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,152
There's our nice                
symbol right there.             

1936
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,953
And let's go and                
add that to our UI as well.     

1937
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,522
Let's go over here              
to our story board,             

1938
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,824
we'll add it instead of Pi.     

1939
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,661
So, we'll get rid of Pi         
instead we'll put that          

1940
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:35,830
operation in there.             

1941
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,866
What was it called again?       

1942
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:39,500
Check.                          

1943
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:46,406
Oops, two of them.              

1944
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,775
We've got this new              
green square root.              

1945
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,144
We still have the old           
square root as well.            

1946
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,813
But we have to add              
this operation and              

1947
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:57,550
I'm gonna use that trailing     
closure syntax right there.     

1948
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:01,154
And of course we know this is,  
it's a double takes a double.   

1949
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:05,025
And this would be where         
the stuff goes in there.        

1950
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:09,830
But we can let Swift infer      
this, and just use $0,          

1951
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,899
square root of $0.              

1952
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:15,035
So we've done everything        
except for the green.           

1953
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:18,004
Does everyone agree with this?  

1954
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:21,174
I'm adding the unary Operation  
named this symbol and here is   

1955
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,578
the second argument put on      
the trailing closure there.     

1956
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:25,479
So how do we turn it green?     

1957
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:28,315
Well, we just say               
display.textColor.              

1958
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:34,121
Turns out UILabel has a text    
color = UIColor.green.          

1959
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,222
Now, when we put this           
in here like this,              

1960
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,790
it's gonna complain.            

1961
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:38,792
Why?                            

1962
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:41,428
Because, reference to           
property display and            

1963
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,097
closure requires                
an explicit self dot            

1964
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,300
to make the capture             
semantics explicit.             

1965
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,837
This is Swift                   
saying watch out.               

1966
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,040
If you do this, you're going    
to capture self right here.     

1967
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,176
And that is going to            
create a memory cycle.          

1968
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,714
This closure right here,        

1969
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:03,550
which lives in the heap,        
is pointing to self.            

1970
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,786
This addUnary operation         
is going to cause it,           

1971
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,422
this closure, to be put in      
the operations table which is   

1972
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,689
pointed to by                   
the View Controller.            

1973
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,692
Now they point at each other.   

1974
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,262
Let's see,                      
what else did I forget here.    

1975
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,230
Missing return.                 

1976
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,065
Yes.                            

1977
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,468
Return square root.             

1978
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:25,772
Everybody cool with that?       

1979
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,513
Now, to break that cycle,       
we could say, unowned self in.  

1980
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,915
That's one way to               
break the cycle.                

1981
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:40,888
We could say, weakSelf = self,  
if we do this                   

1982
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:45,491
one though we're gonna have     
to go here and say weakSelf?    

1983
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,026
Either of those will            
break this cycle.               

1984
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,597
In your homework, I've updated  
your homework to say you        

1985
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:54,167
cannot have any of these        
cycles in your homework.        

1986
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,303
Okay, in assignment three.      

1987
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:58,572
It's in the evaluation          
criteria down there.            

1988
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,774
So I put, posted it on          
the forum for that too.         

1989
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,109
So let's go see if this works.  

1990
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,248
By the way, what happens if     
we don't break that cycle,      

1991
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:12,019
view controllers will just      
start accumulating in memory.   

1992
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:13,921
Because they'll be keeping,     

1993
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,956
these closures will be          
keeping them on our memory.     

1994
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,193
If you, for example,            
had a CalculatorViewController  

1995
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:22,028
that was being pushed on        
to you know segue two and       

1996
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,465
then segue away from, it would  
not go into out of the heap,    

1997
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,467
it would stay in                
heap in that case.              

1998
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,736
Right here is our calculator.   

1999
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:32,906
So 81 square root is            
9 green square root?            

2000
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:33,640
Woo hoo.                        

2001
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:34,842
Square root and                 
turned to green.                

2002
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:39,279
Okay, that's it,                
see you next time.              

2003
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,784

questions, I'm here as always.
