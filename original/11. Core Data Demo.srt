00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:08,339
Stanford University.            

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,075
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P,  

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,978
developing applications for     
iOS.                            

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,414
It's winter of 2017.            

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,083
This is lecture number 11 and   

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,654
today we're gonna do            
one gigantic demo.              

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,390
Last time I made you suffer     
through basically doing         

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,625
all slides.                     

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,895
Now, you get to enjoy all       
demo for the whole time.        

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,464
And it's all gonna be about     
Core Data and applying all      

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,268
the things that we learned in   
the last lecture into a demo.   

13
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,870
And then we'll be coming        
back to the slides, so          

14
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,374
let me just give you a heads    
up of what's happening here.    

15
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:45,043
On Friday, we have this         
other database mechanism for    

16
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,712
storing data in iCloud.         

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,248
I highly recommen this one,     
at our Friday section,          

18
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,883
normal place and time.          

19
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,918
Monday's a holiday, so          

20
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,353
don't show up here on           
Monday cuz I won't be here.     

21
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,356
And then next Wednesday,        
I'll be going over the final    

22
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,226
project requirements,           
including the rubric, and       

23
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,795
also we'll be doing the topic,  
autolayout.                     

24
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:09,200
Now, your assignment            
five has been                   

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:14,439
posted already,                 
and it's due one                

26
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:19,544
week from today                 
before lecture.                 

27
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:23,882
So here's Smashtag              
from last week.                 

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,952
Remember we have this one MVC   
where we type in a search       

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,354
string, #Stanford or            
whatever else,                  

30
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,790
and it pulls down               
a bunch of tweets.              

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,592
Now we're just gonna            
add another MVC,                

32
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,961
a core data driven MVC.         

33
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,198
And when this MVC is gonna      
show all the Twitter users who  

34
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,035
tweeted all the tweets that     
are showing in this MVC         

35
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,069
right here.                     

36
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,072
So, if you type a certain       
search term like #Stanford,     

37
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,674
Stanford gets                   
a bunch of tweets.              

38
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,342
And then there's gonna          
be a button on this MVC,        

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,878
we're gonna put it              
up in the title bar,            

40
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,780
we're gonna show you            
how to do that as well.         

41
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,881
And you're gonna                
click that button.              

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,483
It's gonna bring a new MVC      
with all the users, and         

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,552
we'll also put in               
there how many times,           

44
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,187
how many tweets they tweeted.   

45
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,990
When we do that, we're only     
gonna be looking at the tweets  

46
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,593
that are in this result,        
this search result right here,  

47
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,329
or that have ever come from     
typing this search term.        

48
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:15,233
All right, so this is           
all gonna be core data.         

49
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,469
So we need core                 
data in our app.                

50
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,805
When we built Smashtag we       
didn't click use core data, so  

51
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,708
we're gonna have to go through  
the procedures that I talked    

52
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:28,514
about last time for             
adding core data to our app.    

53
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,916
And we're gonna do that         
by creating a dummy             

54
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,749
app right here.                 

55
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,885
Let's go to New > Project.      

56
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,454
So we're gonna create           
a dummy project,                

57
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,189
you can call this project       
anything you want.              

58
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,057
I'm gonna call it Foo.          

59
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,528
Just make sure that Use Core    
Data is clicked right there.    

60
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,397
We can put it anywhere we want  
cuz we're just gonna turn       

61
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,866
around and                      
delete it in a moment.          

62
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,702
And you can see that it has     
created this dummy project.     

63
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,738
And all we're really            
interested in here is           

64
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,507
the code from the AppDelegate   
that does core data.            

65
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,610
You can see that this           
AppDelegate imports CoreData.   

66
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,345
Now we haven't talked about     
the AppDelegate, and we will.   

67
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,115
It's part of                    
the application lifecycle.      

68
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,016
But, for now,                   

69
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,452
all we need to know is that     
we're gonna go down here and    

70
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,754
get this stuff or core data,    

71
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,157
you recognize this              
from the slides.                

72
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,094
And notice also this            
applicationWillTerminate calls  

73
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,295
saveContext.                    

74
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,366
SaveContext is one of the Core  
Data methods that you get for   

75
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,051
So I'm actually gonna select    
that as well as all the rest    

76
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,669
free here.                      

77
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,906
of this stuff is marked         
Core Data right there.          

78
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,307
And I'm just gonna copy it.     

79
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,776
I'm gonna close this project    
cuz I don't need it.            

80
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,547
And I'm gonna go over to        
the AppDelegate in my Smashtag  

81
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:36,447
right here.                     

82
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,017
And you can see it doesn't      
import core data right there    

83
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:39,584
at the top.                     

84
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,919
Nor does                        
applicationWillTerminate call   

85
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,390
SaveContext, nor does it have   
any of other stuff down there.  

86
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,393
So I'm just gonna take that     
code and paste in here.         

87
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,197
And this code is generic,       
it works in all applications.   

88
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,768
The only thing that's specific  
about it is this string right   

89
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,938
here, which tells you the data  
model, the thing that           

90
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,575
describes the schema of your    
object or in a database.        

91
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,044
Now you notice we have          
an error right here, that's     

92
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,780
because it doesn't recognize    
NSPeristentContainer.           

93
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,784
Because NSPeristentContainer    
is in a different framework     

94
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,019
than UIKit, it's in CoreData.   

95
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,657
So every time you're using      
CoreData in a swift file,       

96
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,494
you need to import CoreData or  
it won't recognize in this      

97
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:27,466
managed object or any of the    
other symbols from core data.   

98
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,303
So that's one thing we have     
to do that we use Core Data     

99
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,004
The other one is actually       
create the data model itself.   

100
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,638
button did.                     

101
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,641
And that we do with             
File > New > File, so           

102
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,276
I'm gonna go File               
> New > File.                   

103
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,080
And we, normally we're picking  
things up here but we're gonna  

104
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,651
scroll down to where it says    
Core Data and pick Data Model.  

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,787
We don't want Mapping Model,    
we want Data Model.             

106
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,324
This is just gonna be that      
thing where we describe all     

107
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,026
our entities and attributes.    

108
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,528
And we can call it              
anything we want.               

109
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,330
Just to be kind of different    
I'm gonna call it Smash.        

110
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,567
That's gonna be the name        
of my Data Model.               

111
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,935
And I'm not gonna put           
in Supporting Files.            

112
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,305
I'm gonna put it in             
Smashtag in a higher,           

113
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,308
this level up here and          
click Create.                   

114
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:10,908
And here it is.                 

115
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,277
You can probably                
recognize this, right?          

116
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,311
This is our entities and        
attributes.                     

117
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,046
We haven't put any              
of them in there.               

118
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,583
Now, since I call this          
Smash and not Foo,              

119
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,719
I've to go back to              
my AppDelegate and              

120
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,625
change this Foo string          
in here to be Smash.            

121
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,494
So I've pretty much now         
reproduced everything that      

122
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,263
the use core data               
button would do.                

123
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,631
The only difference would be    
the use core data would have    

124
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,966
called my xcdatamodeld file.    

125
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,868
It would have                   
called it Smashtag,             

126
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,205
cuz that's the name of my app,  
but I like to call it Smash.    

127
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,210
All right, so now that we have  
this nice data model file,      

128
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,678
let's go ahead and              
create our schema.              

129
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,383
Now, I'm gonna do this really   
quick because I already showed  

130
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,151
you how to do all this          
which you can just watch it     

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,487
happening real fast.            

132
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,756
I'm not gonna show you          
anything that I didn't show     

133
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,391
you in the last lecture.        

134
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,027
I'm gonna start by adding       
an entity down here at          

135
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,980
All right, this entity          
I'm going to rename it.         

136
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,865
the bottom.                     

137
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,368
And I'm gonna do tweets and     
Twitter users cuz I'm gonna     

138
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,204
have that table that            
follows Twitter users.          

139
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,073
But obviously those Twitter     
users are determined by         

140
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,108
a bunch of tweets, so           
those are two entities I need.  

141
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,945
So let's put Tweet here first,  
and                             

142
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,446
we'll add attributes for        
the tweet.                      

143
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,382
I'm gonna add them by clicking  
this little plus right here.    

144
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,953
So we have the Text Attribute   
which is a String.              

145
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:33,157
We have our tweets,             
what if we search for           

146
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,792
#Stanford twice in a row?       

147
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,694
We might get                    
the same tweet back.            

148
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,763
And we want our database        
to have unique tweets,          

149
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,865
we don't wanna every time we    
search we're getting more and   

150
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,400
more of the same                
tweet in there.                 

151
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,702
So I need some sort of unique   

152
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,472
attribute in my database        
which is gonna a string.        

153
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,743
Luckily, the Twitter info       
that comes in the Twitter       

154
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,911
framework, it has a unique      
identifier in there for         

155
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,481
tweets so it'll be              
really easy to set that.        

156
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,982
And I'm not gonna use this but  
for                             

157
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:02,286
example, if I wanted a created  
attribute it would be a date.   

158
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,287
I would just click Date.        

159
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,490
I'm putting this in here cuz    
I just wanna show you what      

160
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,426
it's like to set                
a date in code.                 

161
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,461
This looks slightly tricky.     

162
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,528
So I'm gonna add another, or    

163
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,596
actually we could look          
here in the Editor Style.       

164
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,332
So this is the exact            
same thing here in              

165
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,500
the Editor Style.               

166
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,334
When you're in Editor Style,    

167
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,170
you're almost always            
gonna have your inspector       

168
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,140
open right here so that you     
can click on things and         

169
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,742
change their types and          
things like that.               

170
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,378
I'm gonna create another        
entity here and it's going to   

171
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,215
be our Twitter user, I'm        
gonna call that Twitter user.   

172
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,752
And notice when I               
move these around,              

173
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,422
it moves it around whatever     
other entities there are.       

174
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,357
And I'm gonna be                
connecting these two and        

175
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,160
creating a relationship, and    
you're gonna see it's gonna     

176
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,829
keep drawing it                 
as we draw there.               

177
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,697
So let's add some               
attributes here.                

178
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,200
So I'm gonna click              
Add Attribute.                  

179
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:57,475
Sorry.                          

180
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,244
It's not deleting, let's go     
back to Editor Style here.      

181
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,019
By the way, I do notice         
sometimes that when selecting   

182
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,356
things, it's not                
always that great,              

183
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,657
it doesn't do                   
that great a job.               

184
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,927
I'm not sure what it is about   
the data modeler that makes it  

185
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,629
that way, but                   
you'll click on something,      

186
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,564
and it doesn't click            
on that thing,                  

187
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,232
it clicked the entity or        
something else.                 

188
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,268
So there is an example where    
I was clicking on that          

189
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,503
attribute, but                  
it wouldn't let me delete it.   

190
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,171
Here I have Twitter             
user chosen,                    

191
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,539
hopefully add attribute.        

192
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,741
Yes, it adds it to              
the Twitter user.               

193
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,078
The only attributes I'm gonna   
have on my Twitter user         

194
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:38,683
are the handle, that's your     
@whatever, and then your name.  

195
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,021
And those are both              
going to be strings, so         

196
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,524
we'll go over here and          
make this be of type string.    

197
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:51,595
And we'll also make             
the handle be type string.      

198
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,499
So that's it for                
the attributes.                 

199
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,834
And the only thing we have      
left to do is the relationship  

200
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,735
between these two.              

201
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,437
And I'm gonna hold              
down Ctrl and                   

202
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,540
drag between                    
the two right here.             

203
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,544
And you see it creates a new    
relationship on both sides.     

204
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,344
But we don't want that,         

205
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,615
the Twitter user here, this     
relationship is the tweets      

206
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,850
that this Twitter               
user has tweeted.               

207
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,887
And for the tweet, this         
relationship is the tweeter,    

208
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,157
the person who tweeted it.      

209
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,826
This tweets relationship right  
here we know is a "too many"    

210
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,729
relationship because a Twitter  
user gonna have multiple        

211
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,930
tweets.                         

212
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,599
That's why get the little       
double arrow there.             

213
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,403
That's our entire data          
model that we need now.         

214
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,637
For your homework assignment,   

215
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,540
you're gonna need               
more things in here.            

216
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,742
This is not gonna be            
sufficient to the task, so      

217
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,378
you're gonna have to            
add some more stuff.            

218
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,914
But for our simple example,     
this is all we need.            

219
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,852
Now, we know that we wanna      
access all this stuff,          

220
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,988
not using value in for          
key and set value for key.      

221
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,256
We wanna have subclasses,       

222
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,958
a subclass called               
TwitterUser and a club,         

223
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,392
subclass called Tweet.          

224
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,061
And we want them to             
have the vars for               

225
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,063
all of these attributes and     
relationships.                  

226
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,099
And so, we need that            
code to be generated.           

227
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,769
And the way we do that is we    
just select the answer to,      

228
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,472
you see I've selected Tweet     
right here, entity Tweet.       

229
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,040
And you go down here            
to Codegen, and                 

230
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,442
this says, by default,          
Class Definition.               

231
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,244
That means that it's done it,   

232
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,814
it has generated a class        
called tweet, and               

233
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,782
it's gonna work with all        
the vars in relationship.       

234
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,184
But that's not                  
actually what we want.          

235
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,987
We want to pick this one,       
where it only                   

236
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:27,826
creates an extension to tweet   
that add to the vars stuff.     

237
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,127
That's because we wanna         
write the class tweet and       

238
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,796
be able to put our              
own code in there.              

239
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:35,066
It's very common to one will    
write the class herself         

240
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,100
the main class.                 

241
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,069
But you still want              
the var magic, so               

242
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,104
you want those                  
extensions in there.            

243
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,840
Another thing that I didn't     
really mention in lecture, and  

244
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,376
really, I don't think really    
matters unless you're in        

245
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,845
a workspace like we are,        
you know, we have Twitter and   

246
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,248
smash dot org space, is this    
module name right here.         

247
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,950
If you don't have               
anything in here,               

248
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,719
then it's gonna use a global    
namespace for these classes,    

249
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,055
like tweet, so it's gonna       
call the class tweet.           

250
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,391
But actually, we already        
have a Twitter.tweet, and       

251
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,960
now we're gonna have            
Smashtag.tweet.                 

252
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,564
So we want to change this to    
be current product module.      

253
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,532
So don't forget this.           

254
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,367
Wake up, if you're              
not paying attention.           

255
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,069
If you don't put                
this right here,                

256
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,772
you're likely to                
get tons of errors.             

257
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,074
All kinds of conflicting        
class names,                    

258
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,077
and even if your app builds,    
it won't run.                   

259
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,145
Terrible things will happen,    
so                              

260
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,446
you definitely wanna do this.   

261
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,782
I don't believe you need        
to do this if you're not in     

262
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,416
a workspace.                    

263
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,552
I think if you just             
have an app by itself,          

264
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,288
you can leave that unset,       
and it'll work fine.            

265
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,292
So that, we did that for        
tweet right here, so            

266
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,261
let's do it now for             
Twitter user.                   

267
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,929
Twitter user is default         
in class definition,            

268
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,699
I want that to be extension     
also, and of course,            

269
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,336
I want current                  
product module there.           

270
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,305
So that's all we need to do,    
and behind the scenes,          

271
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,408
Xcode has furiously written     
out this extension to make      

272
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,310
the vars work.                  

273
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,946
But we have said that we're     
gonna write the class.          

274
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,348
So let's do that,               
let's create the class for      

275
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,616
twitter user and for tweets.    

276
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,918
So we're gonna go to            
File > New > File,              

277
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,255
it's just how we create any     
class, it's no different than   

278
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:08,092
any other class we've created,  
Cocoa Touch Class.              

279
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,427
It's not                        
a TableViewController,          

280
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,698
it's an NSManagedObject, so we  
go down here, it's in somewhat  

281
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:19,103
alphabetical order, so, or      
is it here, NSManagedObject.    

282
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,739
We know that Twitter user and   
tweet are representing          

283
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,607
the database as                 
NSManagedObjects or             

284
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,010
subclasses thereof,             
which we're creating.           

285
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,847
So we'll create the tweet       
one first and we hit Next.      

286
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,282
It says,                        
where do you wanna put it, and  

287
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,718
we'll put it in the same        
place as everything else.       

288
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,821
And here it is, we know that    
we're gonna have an error here  

289
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,124
immediately once this thing     
gets around to building that,   

290
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,792
and that's                      
the NSManagedObject.            

291
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,095
It's not gonna identify, it's   
not gonna know what that is     

292
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,132
until we say import CoreData.   

293
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,036
Don't forget this little        
piece in your subclass.         

294
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,273
But now we can put anything     
we want inside these curly      

295
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,976
braces, and we're going         
to put a method in there.       

296
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,347
So let's do the same thing      
here for Twitter user.          

297
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,851
Twitter user, in the same way,  

298
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,688
put everything in               
the same place.                 

299
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,193
Here it is,                     
let's import CoreData.          

300
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,096
Now when you're first           
creating your model file and    

301
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,198
you choose that                 
extension thing, and            

302
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,435
hopefully you remember to do    
current project model, and      

303
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,503
all that stuff,                 
the first time you build, and   

304
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,007
I'm gonna build here,           
you might get some errors.      

305
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,411
We didn't get any of the kind   
of errors that you get from     

306
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,713
things being out of whack, but  
if things are out of whack,     

307
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,115
one thing you can do is go      
up to the product menu,         

308
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,518
and clean,                      
just clean everything out.      

309
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,087
That'll cause XCode to          
regenerate those extensions,    

310
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,188
for example.                    

311
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:48,225
You can even hold down Option   
when you go to the Product      

312
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,594
menu and                        
then Clean Build Folder.        

313
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,997
And that will clean out         
all your drive data and         

314
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,466
rebuild absolutely everything.  

315
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,668
So, those are options.          

316
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,536
And sometimes those             
are options just to do anytime  

317
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,372
something's kinda not           
really working right.           

318
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,207
Now we do have some errors,     
though, let's click and         

319
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,175
see what this error             
is right here.                  

320
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,010
What is this saying?            

321
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,946
It's saying cannot convert      
value tweet to specified        

322
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,981
value tweet.                    

323
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,150
Can anyone see what might be    
the problem with this line      

324
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:13,818
of code right here?             

325
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,823
>> Exactly.                     

326
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,627
Yes, this is saying tweet,      
it doesn't know which one we    

327
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,532
want, twitter.tweet or          
the smashtag.tweet.             

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,502
So we have to, in Swift, fully  
specify which one we want.      

329
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,572
So this one is                  
the twitter.tweet from our      

330
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,339
old code.                       

331
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,807
And once we fix that,           

332
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,045
then now it knows what we're    
talking about and all is well.  

333
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,948
All right, so                   

334
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,884
now we've really got our core   
data stuff all ready to go.     

335
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,922
We've got the classes, we've    
got our data model explained,   

336
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,289
all that stuff.                 

337
00:14:52,358 --> 00:15:00,598
What we're gonna do next is     
have our main MVC right here,   

338
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:05,136
Every time it fetches tweets,   

339
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:12,776
we're gonna have it put         
that tweet in the database.     

340
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,012
Once it loads up the database,  
then we can build this other    

341
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,981
MVC that will query             
the database.                   

342
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,916
So this is gonna be kind        
of the loading one.             

343
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,318
That's gonna be                 
the querying one.               

344
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,854
Now, I might be quite           
tempted to add this code to     

345
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,357
TweetTableViewController.sw-    
ift.                            

346
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,627
Remember the thing we spent     
the last lecture doing all      

347
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,728
this wonderful stuff?           

348
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,298
This would be an obvious        
place, for example in search    

349
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,599
for tweets where I'm            
getting the tweets back,        

350
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,669
this would be an obvious place  
to load up the database.        

351
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,472
However, I don't                
wanna do that here.             

352
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,674
And why don't I                 
wanna do that here?             

353
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,577
Because I have                  
a perfectly good tweet          

354
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,815
table view controller here,     
an awesome MVC, very reusable.  

355
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,518
You give it a search term,      
it'll load up with tweets.      

356
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,219
I don't really wanna            
pollute it and                  

357
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,823
make it non-reusable by tying   
it to my data model here,       

358
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,892
by making it                    
a core data thing.              

359
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,629
So how do I resolve that        
conundrum where I wanna keep    

360
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,497
this thing reusable,            

361
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,600
but I still need to put         
this stuff in the database?     

362
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,938
The answer is, I'm gonna        
subclass this controller.       

363
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,308
I'm gonna make another MVC      
that is going to inherit        

364
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,944
all the capabilities of         
this nice generic one, and      

365
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,145
add the core data stuff.        

366
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:26,850
So I'm just gonna               
go File > New File.             

367
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,854
Cocoa Touch class, I'm gonna    
make it not a subclass of any   

368
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,324
iOS class, but a subclass of    
TweetTableViewController.       

369
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,627
This is my nice                 
generic reusable one,           

370
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,861
I'm gonna make this             
a subclass of that.             

371
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,533
I'm gonna call it               
SmashTweetTableViewController.  

372
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,536
Cuz it uses my                  
smash data model.               

373
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,138
So I'm just gonna create that,  
here we go,                     

374
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,542
put it in the same place        
as always other things.         

375
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,810
I mean we're gonna just delete  
all these code out here.        

376
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,010
Here it is,                     

377
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,980
I always do that just to make   
it clearer to you what I'm      

378
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,816
actually adding                 
in this things.                 

379
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,086
So I have this                  
SmashTweetTableViewController   

380
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,055
and I can go to my story        
board for example and           

381
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,890
select this controller.         

382
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,892
And go to Identity,             

383
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,661
and instead of making it        
a TweetTableViewController,     

384
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,698
I'm gonna make it a             
SmashTweetTableViewController.  

385
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,234
So now, this is going to        
do all the things that          

386
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,802
TweetTableViewController does,  

387
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,239
plus anything I put             
in this sub class.              

388
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,642
Now, unfortunately, we didn't   

389
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,614
get all the way to designing    
our generic reusable one,       

390
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,249
so that it was really nice and  
subclassable.                   

391
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,253
Specifically, it will be        
really hard to subclass search  

392
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,923
for tweets and then get inside  
here, in this closure and       

393
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,026
do something when               
these tweets happen.            

394
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,729
So I'm gonna make my generic    
TweetTableViewController        

395
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,130
a little more subclassable.     

396
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,099
What I'm gonna do is take       
this code right here and        

397
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,968
make a little                   
method out of it,               

398
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,171
insert tweets I'm               
gonna call it.                  

399
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,477
Okay, I'm just gonna create a   
new method called insertTweets  

400
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,980
that's gonna do what that       
code I just cut out there is,   

401
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,414
we'll put it up here.           

402
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,253
Func insertsTweets,             
it can take some new tweets     

403
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:13,824
which is gonna be in            
array of Twitter.tweet.         

404
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,861
It's gonna have that same code  
in there, obviously I don't     

405
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,830
need this weak self business    
here, because I'm not inside    

406
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,200
the closure here, and           
it's going to do it.            

407
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,737
I'm gonna leave this            
essentially internal,           

408
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,906
remember that in                
default internal,               

409
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,542
which means it can be           
overwritten or called.          

410
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,710
If I made that private,         

411
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,346
subclasses would not be         
able to overwrite it.           

412
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,616
Unfortunately there's nothing   
like protected in Swift where   

413
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,586
it's like subclassers can       
override it but people can't    

414
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,424
call it, unfortunately there's  
no such thing as that.          

415
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,260
All right, so we have to leave  
this internal and but now       

416
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,364
I can take this method in my    
subclass here and override it.  

417
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,733
So I just put it here and       
say override, so                

418
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,470
Swift knows that I'm            
overriding this thing.          

419
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,839
Then I'm gonna let              
Super do its work.              

420
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,745
And then I'm going to           
call a method on myself.        

421
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:18,389
updateDatabase(with             
newTweets), all right?          

422
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,893
And that's going to update my   
database, so I'm gonna have     

423
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,531
a private func here called      
updateDatabase (with tweets),   

424
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,167
it's gonna be a Twitter.tweet.  

425
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:36,373
Sorry, I keep hitting this      
tiny button right there.        

426
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:40,678
That's just going to put        
these tweets into Core Data.    

427
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,881
And of course it's complaining  
because import Twitter and      

428
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,416
I'm starting using              
Twitter now.                    

429
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,935
I might as well put it now      
import CoreData because this    

430
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,386
By the way,                     

431
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,189
SmashTweetTableViewController   
is obviously is                 

432
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,292
going to be doing a lot of      
core data stuff as well.        

433
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,960
Everyone see what I did there?  

434
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,298
I just subclass this and        
I'm putting all my smash tag,   

435
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,033
smash core data stuff           
into this subclass, so          

436
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,537
that the super class            
remains completely generic.     

437
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,306
I just had to make my           
super class a little            

438
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,942
more subclassible.              

439
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,043
Now, as with any MVC,           

440
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,879
we want to think about          
the model of this SmashTable,   

441
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,182
SmashTweetTableViewController,  
of course it's going to         

442
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,251
inherit the model               
of its super class.             

443
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,021
But I'm also gonna              
add a model here,               

444
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,791
which is the database to use.   

445
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,862
And I'm gonna do it by passing  
in a PersistentContainer.       

446
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,766
Now normally we probably want   
this to be the app delegate     

447
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,270
view, the app delegate          
persistence container.          

448
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,905
But I wanna allow people        
who are using my MVC,           

449
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,540
to use any database they want.  

450
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,876
I don't wanna force them to     
use that app delegate one.      

451
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,613
Having said that, I am gonna    
have the default value of       

452
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,649
this, go ahead and be that.     

453
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:57,254
So I'm gonna say                
(UIApplication.shared.delegate  

454
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:01,859
as?,                            
AppDelegate)?.persistentConta-  

455
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,094
iner.                           

456
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,095
That's just                     
the default value but           

457
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,897
this is a non-private var, so   

458
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,334
I'm using this ViewController   
could set the container and     

459
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,604
cause it to show things         
in a certain database.          

460
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,673
That is essentially my model,   
my model is this database.      

461
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,975
All this class does though      
is write to the database,       

462
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,912
it's just updating              
the database.                   

463
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,716
All its UI it inherits from     
the super class which is non    

464
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,685
database oriented.              

465
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,987
So how do we update             
this database?                  

466
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:30,988
What do we need to do?          

467
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,325
Well, one thing is, I don't     
really wanna update this thing  

468
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,959
on the main queue, because,     

469
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,396
I don't know if my super class  
might fetch a thousand tweets.  

470
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,865
And do I really wanna be        
blocking the main queue while   

471
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,034
I go write a thousand           
tweets into my database?        

472
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:48,506
No way, so I'm gonna take my    
container right here, and       

473
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:52,943
I'm going to ask it to perform  
something on a background       

474
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,278
thread.                         

475
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,281
A background queue, and you     
can see, here's the argument,   

476
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,383
it's a closure and              
it takes one argument.          

477
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,285
I double-clicked on it there,   

478
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,987
I'm gonna use trailing          
closure syntax even.            

479
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,356
So this one argument            
right here.                     

480
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,994
This is the manage object       
context for that other queue,   

481
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,331
the one that I'm allowed        
to use inside here.             

482
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,066
In order to update              
my database.                    

483
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,802
So I'm just gonna use that      
context and put these tweets,   

484
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,704
these new tweets that           
I got right here,               

485
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,940
I'm gonna put them in           
the database one by one.        

486
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,509
I'm just gonna say for          

487
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:31,048
twitterInfo in this tweets and  
then add tweet.                 

488
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,618
So, how do I do                 
this piece of it.               

489
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,319
How do I add a tweet?           

490
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,256
And by tweet there, I mean      
the tweet in our data model.    

491
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,523
That's what I wanna do.         

492
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,828
Add a tweet in our data model   
that matches this Twitter info  

493
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:45,729
that I got.                     

494
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,732
All right, so we're gonna       
put the method in tweet in      

495
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,601
our subclass of tweet that      
we created right here,          

496
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,170
that's currently empty.         

497
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,306
We're gonna put a static        
method in there to either go    

498
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,409
out and find a tweet that       
matches that twitter info or    

499
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,279
to create one if                
there's not one there.          

500
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,581
So that way they'll keep being  
unique, because if we get       

501
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,984
the same tweet we'll find it    
and just return the one that's  

502
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,652
already there versus            
creating a new one.             

503
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,755
So I'm gonna call this thing,   

504
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,693
it's gonna be static or         
if its a class,                 

505
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:21,065
we can say class func           
findOrCreatTweet, matching,     

506
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:26,937
twitterInfo and that's going    
to be a Twitter.tweet.          

507
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,906
That's the info that's          
gonna be passed into it.        

508
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:33,577
And I need to know what         
context to go look in, so       

509
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:39,783
I'm gonna say, in context,      
NSMan, I need some more space,  

510
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:44,120
MSManagedObjectContext, right   
there.                          

511
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,724
And it's just going             
to return a tweet.              

512
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,496
So this static method, class    
method is just going to go and  

513
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,798
look in the database and        
find this thing and             

514
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,634
if it can find it, then         
it'll just create a new one.    

515
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,104
So, we have to import Twitter,  
(let's get rid of this), and    

516
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,507
so how are we                   
going to do this?               

517
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,574
Well this method,               

518
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:09,313
pretty straight forward based   
on all you know in Core Data.   

519
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,449
First, I'm going to create      
a fetch request to go find      

520
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,083
this tweet.                     

521
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,723
Le's do that tha's easy how     
about let request equal and     

522
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,891
remember I have to statically   
type this actually so           

523
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,893
this is going to be an NS.      

524
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,331
Fetch request.                  

525
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,932
The fetch is what?              

526
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,767
Tweets.                         

527
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,870
So I'm gonna use this           
nice Tweet.fetchRequest         

528
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,938
method to get one.              

529
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,540
So that got me                  
a fetch request.                

530
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,142
A fetch request                 
that's on tweets.               

531
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,943
That's what I have there and    

532
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,046
then I have to have             
a predicate for this.           

533
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,482
So I'm gonna say the request    
predicate this is the thing     

534
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,520
that gonna say which tweets     
do you want in the database?    

535
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:53,624
So predicate here, and          
which tweets do we want?        

536
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,994
Well, we want a tweet           
where the unique key,           

537
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,464
remember the unique key         
is in our data model,           

538
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,132
I'll be going back to           
this data model often.          

539
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,601
But see here's that             
unique key right there.         

540
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,338
We wanna know when that         
unique key matches what         

541
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,373
the person passed in here.      

542
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,774
The twitter info of             
what they passed in.            

543
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:17,113
So that's %@", and              
that's twitterInfo.identifier.  

544
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,650
So it turns out identifier      

545
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,720
that in our twitter             
info dot tweet.                 

546
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,356
That's the thing that you need  
for all time for a tweet.       

547
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,658
It's always the same for        

548
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,460
the tweet even if you           
download it multiple times,     

549
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,961
it's always the same.           

550
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,397
Now what about our              
sort predicate here, or         

551
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,499
our sort descriptors rather?    

552
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,434
We actually don't need          
any sort descriptors            

553
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:41,704
because this better match       
exactly one or zero.            

554
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:45,542
So you don't need to put zero   
things or one thing in order.   

555
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,810
So you don't need               
a sort descriptor and           

556
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,812
if you don't specify a sort     
descriptor you'll get them      

557
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,813
back in random order.           

558
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,550
But again, we don't care        
what that is because it         

559
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,552
better be zero or one or        
we've got problems.             

560
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,754
So how do I fetch this thing?   

561
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,657
Very easy, I'm just gonna       
say let the matches in          

562
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:07,163
the database equal              
context.fetch(request).         

563
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,034
Now the only thing about        
this is it throws.              

564
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,470
Cuz it might not be able        
to access the database.         

565
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,838
It could be all kinds           
of problems, whatever.          

566
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,475
So I'm gonna put this in        
a do try, a do catch here.      

567
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:24,348
So we'll do do and              
put try here.                   

568
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,350
And we'll put catch, (I'll      
talk about what we're gonna do  

569
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,286
when we catch an error there).  

570
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,854
All right, so                   
we got the matches.             

571
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,458
So these matches what's         
the type of this match.         

572
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,060
We got an error here,           
some error.                     

573
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,030
Context.                        

574
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,064
Sorry.                          

575
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:46,269
NSManageObjectContext.          

576
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,872
So what is the type of          
this matches right here?        

577
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,840
Anyone wanna guess?             

578
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,479
Let's look,                     
it's array of tweets.           

579
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,615
Of course I dispatched.         

580
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,584
I get it back                   
an array of Tweet.              

581
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,552
Excellent.                      

582
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,989
And it should be that           
the matches count               

583
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,326
if it's greater that zero,      
then I found my tweet.          

584
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,494
In fact I can just return it.   

585
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,129
Return matches(0).              

586
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,599
So I found that unique tweet.   

587
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,335
I'm actually gonna put          
an assert here though           

588
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,972
that if the matches.count       
is greater than one,            

589
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:26,910
then some kind of               
database inconsistency,         

590
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:31,581
because somehow in              
that unique field               

591
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,950
there's more than one of them   
in there so that will be bad.   

592
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,222
Maybe I'll put the name of      
the method in here tweet dot    

593
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,094
that database inconsistency or  
something like that so,         

594
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:44,928
I'm putting a little assert.    

595
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,197
Now that should never happen    
if I've written my code         

596
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,366
properly, it should             
never be possible for           

597
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,333
two tweets to get in there.     

598
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,202
There would have to be a bug    
somewhere else in my code,      

599
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,336
that's why I'm asserting here,  

600
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,374
cuz I want it to crash if that  
happens so that I notice it.    

601
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,977
Things aren't being duplicated  
without my knowledge.           

602
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,246
Now what about this             
catch right here?               

603
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:07,484
What if we tried to do this     
fetch to get those tweets and   

604
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,385
it fails?                       

605
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,353
Some problem with               
the database or something.      

606
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,088
What should we do in here?      

607
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:17,093
Well, we could fatal error and  
crash.                          

608
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,495
That's what save context does,  

609
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,397
by the way, in the App          
Delegate, it just crash.        

610
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,934
We could look at the error and  
try to figure out what it is,   

611
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:24,968
things like that.               

612
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,871
But you know, I don't actually  
know what the person who's      

613
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,108
calling this find your          
create tweet wants me to do     

614
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,910
if there's a database error.    

615
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,577
I'm not sure,                   
do they want me to ignore it?   

616
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,013
Do they want me to crash?       

617
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,481
Do they want me to try          
again or something?             

618
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,515
What do they want?              

619
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:43,620
So when you don't really know   
what your caller wants to do,   

620
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:49,025
why not just                    
rethrow the error.              

621
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,261
When you rethrow,               
that means this method throws.  

622
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,333
Everyone understand             
what I did there?               

623
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,736
I mean this method              
findOrCreateTweet throw.        

624
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,406
And the only where it throws    
is a rethrows if this           

625
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,476
generates an error.             

626
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,446
So when we call this            
findOrCreateTweet back in our   

627
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,049
other class where we have to    
be careful cuz it throws now.   

628
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:12,816
So I like to use try.           

629
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,653
But if we get down here,        

630
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,323
then we made it passed here     
without finding a match, so     

631
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,225
here's what we need             
to create the tweet.            

632
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,594
So I'm gonna say let            
tweet equal, and                

633
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,862
how do we create a tweet?       

634
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,365
We just say                     
TweetContext context.           

635
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,935
So that creates a tweet         
in the database.                

636
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,737
Now I can just set the tweet    
fields by setting the vars,     

637
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,741
like the tweets, that's         
actually do that unique first,  

638
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,309
that's important one.           

639
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,113
So that's                       
TwitterInfo.identifier.         

640
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,148
We're gonna make sure we said   
that, if we don't said that,    

641
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,684
then we might start getting     
problems here because every     

642
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,653
body is unique is gonna be      
the same zero or blank,         

643
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,988
either or something.            

644
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,690
How about the tweets text?      

645
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:00,296
Let's set that to               
the twitterInfo.text.           

646
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,533
Here's created tweet.created.   

647
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:09,306
That's twitterInfo.created and  

648
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:14,411
then we'll return the tweet.    

649
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,913
Now, this line over here        
is gonna give us an error,      

650
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,414
as soon as it catches up.       

651
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,016
And this error's                
kinda weird one.                

652
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,353
It says cannot assign           
a value of type 'Date' to       

653
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,388
type 'NSDate?'.                 

654
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,524
And I mentioned on one of       
the slides from last time,      

655
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:31,094
that in the database,           
dates are NS dates.             

656
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,431
But I also mentioned that       
you can automatically bridge    

657
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,032
a date to an NS date.           

658
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,734
And you can do that with as.    

659
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,002
So I can say as NSDate.         

660
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:40,937
And that will always work.      

661
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,474
This as will always work as     
long as this Is an NSDate,      

662
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,544
then this as will always work,  
it always can bridge across.    

663
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,246
So this is kind of unfortunate  
that you have to do this for    

664
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,049
your dates, but you do, sorry.  

665
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,452
Okay, there's one more          
thing in tweet, though.         

666
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,620
What's the missing              
thing in tweet?                 

667
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,623
Tweet.tweeter.                  

668
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,925
I've got to set                 
my tweeter here.                

669
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:04,694
I just created this tweet, I    
gotta set who the tweeter is.   

670
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,497
So to do the tweeter,           
I'm gonna go do this exact      

671
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:12,201
same method over                
in TwitterUser.                 

672
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,572
So that I can create a Twitter  
user the exact same way.        

673
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,474
So we'll call it find or        
create Twitter user.            

674
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,944
I, kind of pre canned right     
here cuz you're not gonna       

675
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,479
learn anything from             
me typing this,                 

676
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,583
basically this exact            
same thing in again.            

677
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,718
Gotta import twitter.           

678
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:32,022
But it's exactly the same,      
it has the same exact logic.    

679
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,055
I'm doing exactly               
the same thing.                 

680
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,758
I'm even rethrowing,            

681
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,828
just creating the twitter       
user if I can't find it.        

682
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,997
And for a twitter user, it's    
handle, the person's handle,    

683
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,600
@ whatever,                     
is the unique identifier.       

684
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,071
So now that we know how         
to create a Twitter user        

685
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,141
using that I can say Tweeter    
equals Twitter user.            

686
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,477
Find or there it is,            
finally recognize it.           

687
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,147
Okay, find or                   
create Twitter user, and        

688
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,317
we wanna use the Tweets         
user field, Twitter.            

689
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,955
Lowercase Twitter info dot      
user, that's the user.          

690
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,258
Then we'll do it in             
the same context of course.     

691
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:14,364
Now this throws, so             
we have to try this.            

692
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:18,201
And if it can't do it,          
I'm just going to fail again.   

693
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,505
Here maybe I want to maybe      
re-throw again, possibly.       

694
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,308
I might even wanna crash or     
something, I don't know.        

695
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,310
It's not clear to me,           

696
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,913
what to do if I can't           
create the twitter.             

697
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,716
If Tweeter is something         
that has to be set for          

698
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,519
a tweet to make any sense in    
the database, then I probably   

699
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,155
do wanna re-throw or            
do something terrible here.     

700
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:43,426
But by just saying try,         
instead I'm just giving up,     

701
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,794
okay I'm just not               
setting the tweeter.            

702
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:49,399
So, there could be tweets that  

703
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:54,704
are created with                
no tweeter there.               

704
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,740
Twitter user, yeah,             

705
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,977
twitter user doesn't need       
to be an optional there.        

706
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,312
Sorry, I made that              
accidentally.                   

707
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,349
So It's just going to           
return a twitter user.          

708
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,219
And the try makes it into an    
optional twitter user which is  

709
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,587
okay because tweeter,           

710
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,422
this relationship,              
is an optional twitter user.    

711
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,860
It comes out of                 
our data model.                 

712
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,099
So, that's it,                  
that's how we create a tweet.   

713
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,734
We need to use this             
method right here to put        

714
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:25,868
those tweets in the database.   

715
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,572
So, let's go back to here.      

716
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:34,210
Let's go to our                 
SmashTweetTableViewController.  

717
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,147
And here, where we wanna add    
the tweets, we'll just say      

718
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,753
Let a Tweet equal               
Tweet.findOrCreateTweet.        

719
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,722
We'll pass it,                  
the Twitter info.               

720
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,358
That's this Twitter info right  
here that was passed to us and  

721
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,560
these Tweets.                   

722
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:54,798
And in context, we're gonna     
use our containers context.     

723
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,069
Sorry, we're not using          
our container context.          

724
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,672
We're using this                
context right here.             

725
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,407
So we use this little           
context right here.             

726
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,444
Now of course we know this      
thing throws right here.        

727
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,080
So we'll just do try            
question mark here.             

728
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,282
Because here I do know          
that when I'm updating          

729
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,884
if I can't create that tweet,   
I'm just gonna drop it.         

730
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,418
the database,                   

731
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,588
It's not gonna hurt anything    
if just not collecting          

732
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,455
the data it needs too.          

733
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,891
There's really nothing I        
can do about it whatever        

734
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,827
the database error is it's in   
there maybe I could report      

735
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,464
an error to the user and say    
couldn't update data base but   

736
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,332
a lot of times user are like    
what the heck is that.          

737
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:34,971
So here dropping it             
is probably fine.               

738
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,674
Now notice we have a warning    
here, see this warning?         

739
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,744
It says let tweet equals and    
you never use tweet, and        

740
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,113
in fact I don't                 
wanna use tweet.                

741
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,917
So what do you do in this       
case where I found and          

742
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,552
create this tweet but           
I actually don't want it.       

743
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:50,587
I don't wanna do anything,      

744
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,989
I just wanted it to get         
created if it wasn't there.     

745
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,257
Well here you can say,          
"Under bar".                    

746
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,829
If you say _ =" something it    
means I'm ignoring the return   

747
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,831
value, which is fine.           

748
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,301
I don't need the return value   
I just want this thing created  

749
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,403
in the database,                
doesn't have to do anything.    

750
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,539
Everybody following me so       
far here?                       

751
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,776
So now we have loaded           
up the database.                

752
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,544
That's it.                      
That's all of the code we need  

753
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,646
to load our database up         
with all these tweets.          

754
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:20,383
Now let's go ahead and print    
some database statistics here   

755
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,852
just to see if this is          
working before we go off and    

756
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,755
do our UI for a new MBC.        

757
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:30,293
So I'm gonna say,               
printDatabaseStatistics and     

758
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:34,630
I'm gonna create a new          
private func here called        

759
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,734
printDatabaseStatistics.        

760
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,370
Copy, paste.                    

761
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,874
And what I want this thing to   
do is tell me how many tweets   

762
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,076
and how many twitter users      
are in the database.            

763
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,446
That's all I                    
wanted to do here.              

764
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,383
So if I wanna do anything       
in the database, if             

765
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,452
I wanna look in the database    
I obviously need a context.     

766
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,121
I have to have a context to     

767
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,357
look inside the database or     
whatever.                       

768
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,192
So what context                 
am I gonna use?                 

769
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:08,064
I'm gonna say, if I can let     
my let context equal my         

770
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,234
containers?.viewContext.        

771
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:15,104
Now the viewContext Is          
the mainqueue context for       

772
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,006
this database.                  

773
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,342
So, I'm gonna have              
printDatabaseStatistics.        

774
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,811
It's not inside this closure,   
so                              

775
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,613
it's not gonna                  
use this context.               

776
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,448
We'll have it use               
the main viewContext.           

777
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,752
This is pretty much, unless     
you had it perform background   

778
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,754
tasks, this is pretty much      
the only context you have, so   

779
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,623
we'll have it do on             
the main context.               

780
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,692
So how am I gonna find out      
how many tweets there are?      

781
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,629
Okay, I'm gonna create          
a request and do a fetch.       

782
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,464
So NSFetchRequest.              

783
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,934
And this one is a request for   
tweets.                         

784
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,571
Equals Tweet.fetchRequest.      

785
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,206
So now I got this request,      
the fetch request               

786
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:54,844
I need no predicate here        
because I want all the tweets.  

787
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:58,214
If you have no predicate        
that means give me them all.    

788
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:02,151
So that's what I want, and      
so now I'm just going to        

789
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,390
say here if I can let           
the tweetCount equal            

790
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:12,629
trying to access the context    
to fetch this request.          

791
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,831
Which it may or                 
not be able to do.              

792
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,302
But if it can then you          
understand what I did there?    

793
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,138
Then I'm going to               
get the count.                  

794
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,943
What's the type of              
that expression?                

795
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,381
Optional array of tweets.       

796
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,384
Because this returns            
an array of tweets if it        

797
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,386
doesn't throw and               
this turns into an optional.    

798
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,589
So this is an optional          
array of tweets.                

799
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,857
Here I'm optional chaining.     

800
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,194
So if that's not new then       
I get to continue and           

801
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,328
get the count.                  

802
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,565
This is just array's count,     
this is a method count in       

803
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,535
array a var for                 
the count in array.             

804
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:58,408
Now I've got the tweetCount,    
now I'm just gonna say print,   

805
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,979
tweetCount, tweets,             
and that's it.                  

806
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,383
I fetch them all.               

807
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:10,353
I just fetched every tweet      
in the entire database,         

808
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,188
just to find out how            
many there were.                

809
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,323
What if there's a 100,000       
Tweets in there?                

810
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,792
I'm really gonna fetch and      
that, of course we know that    

811
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,328
it's only gonna fault sum of    
min until I ask for the data.   

812
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,163
So it's not that bad but        

813
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,599
there's a better                
way to do this.                 

814
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,801
By the way here's another,      
before I show that.             

815
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,270
See this request I made this    
separate variable, right here.  

816
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,006
That's not actually necessary.  

817
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,475
I can just take this            
request right here and          

818
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,976
put it right in.                

819
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,044
To here.                        

820
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:35,978
Watch this.                     

821
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:40,283
Cut, paste, and                 
get rid of that.                

822
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:43,285
That's because                  
the fetch method takes          

823
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,354
any kind of fetch request.      

824
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:49,492
It takes anything whose type    
is a fetchRequest result        

825
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,294
basically, which                
is a protocol.                  

826
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,129
And so I didn't have to         
create that other variable.     

827
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,232
And notice I don't have to      
statically type this because    

828
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,501
this would take anything        
that returns a fetchRequest.    

829
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,602
It'd return something.          

830
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,071
So anyway, so                   

831
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,274
what's the better way to        
do counting right here?         

832
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,276
Is I'm gonna say if             
let tweeterCount, so            

833
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,880
I'll count the tweeters in      
this better way, equals try     

834
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:16,719
to get the context.count for:   

835
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:22,992
TwitterUsers.fetchRequest,      
okay, all twitter users.        

836
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,263
Then I can print                
the twitterCount.               

837
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:36,605
Twitter users.                  

838
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,143
So this method count is         
very much like fetch but        

839
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,913
it doesn't is still kinda       
evaluating this fetch request,  

840
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:44,913
it's getting the same things.   

841
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,882
In this case we're              
counting users, but             

842
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,851
it's really just                
asking the data base.           

843
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,256
If I were to fetch this,        
how many would you give me?     

844
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,158
So it's all done on             
the database side,              

845
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,827
nothing actually                
has to get fetched.             

846
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,563
So it's just another            
method count.                   

847
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,899
But it does throw, as well,     
in the same was as Fetch does.  

848
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,366
So we still have to do try.     

849
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,138
So this whole expression        
right here, isn't option int.   

850
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,609
So I'm unwrapping it with if    
let, and printing it out.       

851
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,111
Got all that?                   

852
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,282
Let's cross our                 
fingers here that this          

853
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,751
all works that we've got        
all this database learning.     

854
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,122
And we gonna print              
our database                    

855
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:34,197
statistics and                  
it all gonna work.              

856
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:40,002
Here we go and this is just     
some junk from IOS there so     

857
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,871
we'll ignore that.              

858
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,739
Right here let's search for     
some.                           

859
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,642
Let's search for,               
how about hash tag stan,        

860
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:49,178
well let's do hash tag stan,    
yeah, that's a good one.        

861
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,882
All right, it wants to          
use my Twitter account.         

862
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,851
Sure, here it is, and.          

863
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,755
Uh-oh, look on                  
the console there.              

864
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,992
Zero tweets,                    
zero Twitter users.             

865
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,296
Maybe let's pull some more.     

866
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:10,833
No, it's still zero tweets,     
zero Twitter user.              

867
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,402
Well it's not working.          

868
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,738
Anyone see anything             
in this code for                

869
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,208
why this is not working.?       

870
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah, we're doing a good job    
of loading up that database,    

871
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,982
but we never save it.           

872
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,886
So all that is just             
waste of time,                  

873
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:34,356
we need to say try,             
context, save.                  

874
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,924
Now again I'm ignoring          
the error here.                 

875
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,494
In a demo a lot of the time I   
use try, question mark because  

876
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,229
I just don't have time          
to do the due catch and         

877
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,531
handle all the errors.          

878
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,632
That's something you should     

879
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,033
be looking at                   
the option of doing.            

880
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,168
So here I'm just                
gonna save and                  

881
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,136
ignore any errors, alright?     

882
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,671
So that should fix it right?    

883
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:57,346
Let's go see.                   

884
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,447
All right, here we go.          

885
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,218
Hash tag Stanford.              

886
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,020
No.                             

887
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,421
Zero tweet.                     

888
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,555
Zero Twitter users.             

889
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,524
I put that save in there.       

890
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,324
What is going on?               

891
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,827
I had to pull again.            

892
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,697
Look, I pulled and it worked.   

893
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,233
What the heck is going on?      

894
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,902
When I first loaded up          
it said zero tweets and         

895
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,837
then now it's saying 57th.      

896
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,773
Something weird going on here.  

897
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,174
What's happening?               

898
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,877
Well, this is actually          
a multi threading problem.      

899
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,881
Can anyone see the              
multi-threading problem here?   

900
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,583
No?                             
I'm gonna put some print in,    

901
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,384
so you can see it.              

902
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:42,258
So watch this, print,           
starting database load.         

903
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,328
And then down here, when I'm    
done with the save here,        

904
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,566
I'm gonna just print,           
done loading database.          

905
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:56,472
And there, so                   

906
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:03,012
now let's run.                  

907
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:08,451
All right, hash tag Stanford.   

908
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,755
Got a crash there, database     
inconsistency, interesting.     

909
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,324
So this is why we put           
this inserts in here.           

910
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,193
Asserts in here, so let's       
see why do we think we have     

911
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,163
a data basing                   
consistency here?               

912
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:22,899
Yeah?                           

913
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:29,772
>> That's what it is.           

914
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,208
Yes, my search is backwards,    
there.                          

915
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,643
I'm inserting here that         
matches.count == 1.             

916
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,580
So that's why that's crashing,  
okay.                           

917
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:42,718
Good.                           
Let's                           

918
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:47,723
go back.                        

919
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,993
Now let's try again,            
hashtag Stanford.               

920
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:55,030
Let's see what's                
going on down here.             

921
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,568
Starting database load,         
it prints the statistics, and   

922
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,170
then it's done loading.         

923
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,671
That's bad.                     

924
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,273
You see, it's not waiting for   

925
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:07,143
it to be done loading before    
it prints the statistics.       

926
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:08,744
You see?                        

927
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,813
Now why is that happening?      

928
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:14,583
Because we're putting print     
databaseStatistics here after   

929
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,117
downloading.                    

930
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:17,419
So why isn't it saying          
starting, done,                 

931
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,687
and then printing?              

932
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:22,391
Because this right here,        

933
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,263
happens on a different queue.   

934
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,098
So the way that                 
this code goes is,              

935
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,102
starting, this execute          
returns immediately.            

936
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,603
Because all it                  
does is put this                

937
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,640
closure onto                    
the background task queue.      

938
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:38,775
Then this happens.              

939
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,612
Then, this closure starts       
running on that background      

940
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,714
queue, loads up these things.   

941
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,649
And it prints.                  

942
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,619
Do you see what's               
going on there?                 

943
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,221
Everyone understand             
the multi-threading?            

944
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,224
So the way to make this work    
is to take print database       

945
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,627
statistics, and                 
put it inside here.             

946
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,799
All right, cuz now it's not     
going to print the database     

947
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,701
statistics until it's done.     

948
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,836
Now this has a problem though.  

949
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,838
Okay, this is very bad.         

950
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,575
First of all, we're gonna have  
to do, I'm not sure why it's    

951
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:14,577
not complaining here,           
there we go, now it is.         

952
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:18,281
It wants to know,               
it wants self dot here, so      

953
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:22,652
I'm gonna do weak self to       
break that memory cycle.        

954
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,988
Hopefully everyone understands  
that now, what's going on.      

955
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:26,588
Okay.                           

956
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,656
But that's not                  
the problem here.               

957
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,191
There's an even worse problem.  

958
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,459
And in the interest of time,    

959
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:34,664
I'm going to put a print down   
in here to show you something.  

960
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,034
If I'm gonna check              
to see if this code             

961
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,302
is running on the main thread.  

962
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,637
So I'm gonna say IF,            

963
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:46,342
and the way you do that is      
you say thread.ismainthread.    

964
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,743
Okay, if I'm in the main        
thread it'll be true.           

965
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:51,280
So I'm gonna say                
on main thread.                 

966
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:57,920
And if it's not true,           
I'm gonna say off main thread.  

967
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:01,289
So let's see if this            
statistics is happening         

968
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,992
on the main thread or not.      

969
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,195
I think many of you know        
which one it's going to be.     

970
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,331
By looking at the code here.    

971
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,135
All right, here we go again,    
hash tag Stanford.              

972
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,304
Here we go.                     

973
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,672
Off main thread.                

974
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,842
Okay, why is it off             
the main thread?                

975
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,511
Because I called print          
database statistics inside      

976
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,548
this closure, it happens on     
a background thread thus this   

977
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,117
entire method is happening      
off the main thread.            

978
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,152
Now, is that a problem?         

979
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:34,824
That's a huge problem, because  
what context am I using here?   

980
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,192
The mainQueue context.          

981
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,129
ViewContext is                  
the mainQueue context.          

982
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:44,333
I cannot be using the           
mainQueue context off the main  

983
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,200
thread.                         

984
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,303
You see the problem here?       

985
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,572
So it worked, but               
could have easily crashed or    

986
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,674
done something terrible.        

987
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,876
So how do we fix that?          

988
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,944
This is where we use            
that method I was telling       

989
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,246
you about in context            
called perform.                 

990
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:04,287
I'm gonna say context perform   
this code on your safe queue.   

991
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:11,059
When I say context perform and  
I put this code in there,       

992
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,562
it says to that context,        
do this block but               

993
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,599
whatever you do, do it on       
the right queue for you.        

994
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,068
And since this is               
the view context,               

995
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:26,175
it's going to be back           
on the main thread,             

996
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,378
watch.                          

997
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:32,814
Hashtag Stanford.               

998
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,851
Here we go back                 
on main thread.                 

999
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,688
So this perform right           
here is something that          

1000
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:41,356
a lot of people would advise,   

1001
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:45,594
always use it unless you're     
Inside one of these where it's  

1002
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,298
clearly using this context      
in this background thing.       

1003
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,232
Any other time,                 

1004
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,401
a lot of people say always      
wrap your calls in this.        

1005
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,903
That way, you'll never have     
a problem where some things     

1006
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,307
being executed on the wrong     
thread, okay, wrong que.        

1007
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,177
Understood all that?            

1008
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,346
A little crash course in core   
data thread safety there.       

1009
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:07,382
All right, so this is great.    

1010
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,284
We've got our database          
loading up, so                  

1011
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,153
we've got a database            
full of tweets.                 

1012
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:16,191
Now, we want to add some UI to  
show all this data somehow.     

1013
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,327
So let's go back to our         
storyboard and take a look,     

1014
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,061
what we got here.               

1015
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,930
And what kinda UI               
we're gonna have?               

1016
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,766
Like I said, I'm just gonna     
have another MVC over here      

1017
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,903
that I'm gonna segue to,        
with a little bar button item.  

1018
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,239
So how many of you figured out  
how to use a bar button item    

1019
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,374
as part of your homework        
assignment I think?             

1020
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,943
But if you didn't you're gonna  
see today how to do it, and     

1021
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,311
it's quite simple.              

1022
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,216
So this new MVC that I'm gonna  
segue to, let's go ahead and    

1023
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:43,385
create an MVC for it,           
Cocoa Touch Class.              

1024
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,053
It is just going                
to be a sub class               

1025
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,588
of UITableViewController.       

1026
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,392
I'm gonna call it               
SmashTweetersTableViewControl-  

1027
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,360
ler, so                         
this is showing tweeters.       

1028
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,229
Remember this table's gonna     
show all the tweeters who       

1029
00:48:54,298 --> 00:49:00,402
tweeted the tweets that         
are in the other MVC.           

1030
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,072
We'll put it up at the,         
not in the Twitter project,     

1031
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:03,805
that's for sure.                

1032
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,340
Let's put it down here, okay?   

1033
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,443
I always check this list,       
this one here or                

1034
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,611
you end up with files           
all in random places.           

1035
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,181
You don't want that.            

1036
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,181
Here it is.                     
Again,                          

1037
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,417
I'm gonna delete                
all this stuff.                 

1038
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:16,552
See it's a tableView, so        

1039
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,187
it's got all this UITableView,  
so we don't need any of this    

1040
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,790
stuff as you're                 
gonna see here.                 

1041
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,896
This is our new                 
TableViewController.            

1042
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,897
Let's go ahead and              

1043
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,267
update our storyboard           
to segue to this thing.         

1044
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,202
So we'll go over here.          

1045
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:36,138
Let's create our bar button     
item to do the segue, so        

1046
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,139
I'm gonna search here for       
button.                         

1047
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,742
You never wanna put             
a button in here,               

1048
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:45,246
it'll look like it's gonna      
working, but it's not right.    

1049
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,316
Put a bar button in a bar.      

1050
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,821
So we'll call this Tweeter cuz  
that's what it shows, it shows  

1051
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,725
the tweeters that tweeted all   
the tweets in this table.       

1052
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,995
Let's get                       
a TableViewController out,      

1053
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:04,733
here it is.                     

1054
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,203
TableViewController right       
there.                          

1055
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,805
Lets go ahead and               
segue from this.                

1056
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,606
Ctrl + drag.                    

1057
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,543
Show segue, we're inside        
a navigation controller here.   

1058
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:18,747
Let's set this segue            
identifier, we'll call this,    

1059
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:19,682
what did I?                     

1060
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:20,715
I had a good name for this.     

1061
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:25,620
Yes, Tweeters                   
Mentioning Search Term.         

1062
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,788
Cuz that's what                 
this segue does.                

1063
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,792
It show the tweeters that       
have mentioned this search      

1064
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,160
term right here.                

1065
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,964
Let's also have our little      
cell here be a subtitle cell.   

1066
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,166
So we'll change                 
that to subtitle.               

1067
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,401
And we need a reuse identifier  
for this cell right here.       

1068
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,939
We'll call this a TwitterUser   
Cell, cuz that's what it is.    

1069
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,376
The Twitter user gonna be       
shown in this cell right here.  

1070
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,077
All right, so that's it.        

1071
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,645
That's our entire UI.           

1072
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,613
Super simple.                   

1073
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,817
All we need to do now is        
implement the guts of           

1074
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,217
this controller right here.     

1075
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,153
So let's go back to that.       

1076
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,922
Here it is right here.          

1077
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,325
Let's talk about                
the public API.                 

1078
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,860
I just really want to get       
in the habit of this.           

1079
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,763
Every time we introduce a new   
MVC, let's talk about it,       

1080
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,297
its public API.                 

1081
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,767
So this                         
SmashTweetersTableViewControl-  

1082
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:14,369
ler, really has two             
parts in its model.             

1083
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:18,474
One is, it needs to know the    
mention, the search term that   

1084
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,911
its supposed to be showing      
the Tweeters for, so I'm gonna  

1085
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,748
have, I'll call it mention,     
which is just a string.         

1086
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,817
So that's part of its           
public model, and then,         

1087
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,553
what's the other                
part of its model?              

1088
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,355
The database.                   

1089
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,092
What it does is look            
up in the database and          

1090
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,661
find tweeters who mention       
this in their tweets.           

1091
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:44,166
So it's gotta have              
an NSPersistentContainer here.  

1092
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:50,139
By the way, some people,        
import CoreData.                

1093
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,574
Instead of having the database  
represented in the public       

1094
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,376
model here as a container,      

1095
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,212
they might just pass            
the context only.               

1096
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,648
If they pass the context        
only here though,               

1097
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,683
you can't do any                
background stuff.               

1098
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,119
So I like to pass,              
pass the container here.        

1099
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:07,690
Plus, this whole thing          
is a UI element,                

1100
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,625
so it wants to use              
a view context.                 

1101
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,295
No other context cuz it does    
its stuff all on the main       

1102
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:14,830
queue, it's a UI.               

1103
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,466
So it's nice when you pass a    
container cuz you're gonna ask  

1104
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,534
for the view context and        

1105
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,669
you know you're getting         
a main queue context.           

1106
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,238
Where if someone passes         
a context in here,              

1107
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,008
could be not be a main queue    
context, that could be bad.     

1108
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,612
So I think a container is a     
good wrapper when you want to   

1109
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,949
tell an MVC this is the         
database to use to do what you  

1110
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,584
do, here it is.                 

1111
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:39,788
And sure we'll do our little    
trick here where we make        

1112
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:40,723
a default,                      

1113
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:44,259
(UIApplication.shared.delegete  
as?                             

1114
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:49,264
AppDelegate)?.persistentConta-  
iner.                           

1115
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:54,770
You don't even really have      
to do this but we'll do it.     

1116
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:00,341
So that's basically             
our model and                   

1117
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,912
anytime our model changes,      

1118
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:10,719
I'm gonna have a didSet         
here that updates my UI.        

1119
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,655
We'll do the same thing.        

1120
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:14,723
If I can select it,             

1121
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,692
do the same thing with          
this guy right here.            

1122
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,331
We need a private               
func to do that.                

1123
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:30,372
So this is our model,           
and it's UI updating.           

1124
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,974
Now before I go implement       
this UI updating,               

1125
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,343
cuz it's pretty                 
straightforward,                

1126
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:38,314
I'm gonna back to my            
SmashTweetTableViewController,  

1127
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,482
the one that's gathering        
all the statistics,             

1128
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,985
because that's also             
the one I'm segueing from.      

1129
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,687
This smash,                     
this one right here,            

1130
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,356
Smash Tweet Table               
View Controller,                

1131
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,625
I'm segueing from this to       
this using this button.         

1132
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:51,893
So that's where                 
the prepare needs to be.        

1133
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,129
So I'm gonna put the prepare    
in here for that.               

1134
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,364
So let's put the prepare        
down at the bottom here.        

1135
00:53:56,433 --> 00:54:00,802
prepare (for segue:.            

1136
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:01,603
Here it is.                     
Now,                            

1137
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:04,173
I'm gonna go through this       
really fast because you guys    

1138
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,208
surely know prepare             
(for segue: by now.             

1139
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,745
I mean to say if                
the segue:identifier is what    

1140
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,045
I said which is,                

1141
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:15,217
and again I should make         
a constant here but for speed,  

1142
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,753
so this is Tweeters             
Mentioning Search Term,         

1143
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,489
that's what I                   
called that segue.              

1144
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,592
Then I'm going to               
get the destination.            

1145
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:28,363
So that is a                    
TweetersTableViewController =   

1146
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,233
segues.destination as?          

1147
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:35,604
SmashTweetersTableViewControl-  
ler.                            

1148
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:38,840
And yeah, I could probably do   
ContentViewController here,     

1149
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:41,810
because if I had that           
extension in here, because      

1150
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:44,913
maybe I want to put this in     
a split view someday and etc.   

1151
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:47,849
But first time                  
I won't do that.                

1152
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,418
So now I've got                 
the tweetersTVC.                

1153
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,954
This is my                      
TweetersTableViewController.    

1154
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,922
I'm just gonna set              
its public API.                 

1155
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,791
TweetersTVC.mention.            

1156
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,997
Mention equals my search term.  

1157
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:05,200
This is the MVC where           
you type the text in so         

1158
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,602
it has search text.             

1159
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:10,271
And then the                    
tweetersTVC.container equals    

1160
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,539
my container.                   

1161
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,640
I have the same one.            

1162
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,877
The tweeters MVC looking        
in the same database I'm        

1163
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:16,811
looking in.                     

1164
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,915
So here I am actually           
setting this thing.             

1165
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,217
We got an error here,           
what is it?                     

1166
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,452
Tweeters, okay.                 

1167
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,989
All right, so I'm just          
setting my public model of      

1168
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,393
my Tweeters, not Tweet,         
TweetersTableViewController.    

1169
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,962
SImple enough.                  

1170
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:37,332
All right, now that we are all  
ready to segue to this nice     

1171
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,668
SmashTableViewController, how   
do we update its UI?            

1172
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,138
How do we get it to             
look in CoreData,               

1173
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,975
find the Twitter users that     
have tweeted something that     

1174
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,411
matches this mention and        
show it?                        

1175
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,079
Well, there's really,           

1176
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,681
we're gonna use NS Fetched      
Results Controller, of course,  

1177
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,984
that's the main deal here.      

1178
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,954
And what are the pieces         
we need to do?                  

1179
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,823
This was the last slide         
from the last lecture.          

1180
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:05,460
I hope you all remember it,     
it was very recent.             

1181
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,264
First thing is we have to have  
this table-view controller      

1182
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,935
be an                           
NS-fetched-result-controller    

1183
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:13,836
If you're going to use          
a fetched results controller    

1184
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:14,670
delegate.                       

1185
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,505
your table needs to be          
the delegate of that fetched    

1186
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,008
controller, and I told you I    
was going to help you out with  

1187
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,212
that and provide that code and  
sure enough I am.               

1188
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,845
It's right here.                

1189
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:28,550
I'm gonna drag it in            
somewhere, copy it in, yes.     

1190
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,255
All right, and let's take       
a look at it, here it is,       

1191
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:35,824
FetchedResultsTableViewContro-  
ller.                           

1192
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,293
You can see that it             
is a subclass of                

1193
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:40,796
UITableViewController that      
implements the                  

1194
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:43,398
NSFetchedResultsControllerDel-  
egate protocol.                 

1195
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,001
So these are the methods        
right here in our protocol,     

1196
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,702
there are four of them.         

1197
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:51,139
You can see that it is just     
using table view methods        

1198
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,975
to update the table.            

1199
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,810
These controller methods        
get called whenever the NS      

1200
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:59,414
Fetched Result Controller       
notices the database change     

1201
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,650
in a way that would affect      
the NS Fetched Result.          

1202
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,652
So this is the magic            
that makes your table           

1203
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,521
automatically update when       
the database changes.           

1204
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,190
You don't have to do anything,  
it just automatically updates.  

1205
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,025
It's because of this delegate.  

1206
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,696
Now, for our thing to work we   
need to be a subclass of this,  

1207
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,399
so that we inherit              
all this stuff.                 

1208
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,335
we're just going to go back     
to our smashTweeters here and   

1209
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:21,203
So that's easy,                 

1210
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,938
instead of being                
a UITableViewController,        

1211
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,139
I'm gonna be a                  
FetchedResultsTableViewContro-  

1212
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,110
ller, simple.                   

1213
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,012
So, that's the easy             
way to become                   

1214
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,114
a FetchedResultsController      
delegate.                       

1215
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,616
Now, what was the next          
thing we need to do?            

1216
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,452
We have to implement all of     
our UITableViewDataSource       

1217
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:41,689
Methods using                   
a fetchedResultsController.     

1218
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,258
So there's two parts to that.   

1219
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,793
One is we need to               
create a var, which is          

1220
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:51,099
a fetchedResultsController      
controller.                     

1221
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,136
It's going to be a type         
NSFetchedResultsController.     

1222
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,877
It's FetchResultsController     
that fetches tweeter users.     

1223
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,615
So FetchResultsController       
is also generic type and        

1224
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,184
you have to say what kind       
of thing does it fetch?         

1225
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,053
So I've got this var,           
how do I implement all          

1226
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,721
those UI table of your data     
source methods as well?         

1227
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,890
Well, I can type them all       
in but you know what,           

1228
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,960
it's exactly the same in every  
single to every single time     

1229
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,663
you implement one of these      
the code is exactly the same    

1230
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:22,897
because                         
fetchedResultsController        

1231
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,700
always answers those questions  
in exactly the same way.        

1232
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:26,901
So you could copy and           

1233
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,404
paste it from some other        
half that you've done or        

1234
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,706
you could use this little       
beauty that I've created for    

1235
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:35,210
you right here, another         
little thing you can drag in,   

1236
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,211
which we'll take a look.        

1237
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,949
Copy that, and                  
this is an extension            

1238
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:45,354
that you can                    
extend your class.              

1239
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,188
So in this case,                

1240
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,092
it's our smash tweeters         
tableviewController.            

1241
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,359
And in this extension,          

1242
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,330
it adds all the UI tableview    
data source methods.            

1243
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,365
See.                            

1244
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,434
And implements them             
in terms of your                

1245
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,069
fetchresultscontroller.         

1246
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:04,172
Now, this extension will not    
compile if you do not have      

1247
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,508
a fetch results controller      
because extensions can't add    

1248
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,812
any storage themselves so you   
have to have the storage be in  

1249
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:14,382
your class but this class does  
have fetch result controller.   

1250
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:18,386
Now, the one thing it doesn't   
implement here though is        

1251
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:22,357
cellForRowAt cuz cellForRowAt   
add is specific to whatever     

1252
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,993
data you're showing             
in the table but                

1253
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:29,064
even cellForRowAt, if we go     
back here and do cellForRowAt,  

1254
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:33,835
let's do that so cellForRowAt   
index path more with.           

1255
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,436
And, of course,                 
we know how to do that right,   

1256
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:40,542
let the cell equal to           
tableView deque this one,       

1257
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:45,880
and the Identifier was          
"TwitterUser Cell" I believe,   

1258
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,315
correct me if I'm wrong.        

1259
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,151
And we want IndexPath there,    
so I got the cell, and          

1260
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,586
we return the cell.             

1261
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,587
And in between,                 

1262
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:57,025
I need to load the cell up      
with its various information.   

1263
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,627
Now we set our cell to be,      
if you remember,                

1264
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,196
a Subtitle cell, right?         

1265
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,231
This is a Subtitle cell.        

1266
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,668
So we can set its TextLabel     
and its detailTextLabel.        

1267
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,904
So let's just start with        
just the TextLabel.             

1268
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:14,175
So I wanna set                  
the cell.textLabels Text,       

1269
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:19,814
basically equal to              
the twitter uses handle.        

1270
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:23,051
But I have to get the twitter   
user that's in this row.        

1271
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,254
Okay, how do I find             
the twitter user                

1272
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,121
that's in the role?             

1273
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,192
I'm gonna ask my fetch          
results controller.             

1274
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,595
Let the twitter                 
user in this role,              

1275
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:37,299
in this row, equal my           
fetch results controller        

1276
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,235
which might be null             
cuz it's an optional.           

1277
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:45,640
Object(at: indexPath).          

1278
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:50,178
And since this could be nil     
because this could be nil       

1279
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:55,517
right here let's do if let,     
then we will update our cell.   

1280
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,054
Now if we didn't have           
a fetchedResultsController,     

1281
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,090
by the way, if this were nil,   
our number of rows and          

1282
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,625
sections would be               
zero all the time.              

1283
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:04,559
This would never be called.     

1284
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,095
So we can even put              
an exclamation point here.      

1285
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,730
And maybe we should put         
an exclamation point here       

1286
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,499
because this should never       
be called if this is nil.       

1287
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,702
But anyway, so it's this very   
simple method, object)at:,      

1288
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,873
is gonna return you             
the thing of the type           

1289
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,774
that it's controlling,          
which is Twitter user.          

1290
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,176
And if we look at               
the type here,                  

1291
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,179
you can see that's a Twitter    
user that goes at this          

1292
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:24,812
index path.                     

1293
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,213
So that row and that section.   

1294
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,582
So it could not be easier.      

1295
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,851
And now we can just, in here,   
update whatever you or          

1296
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,620
I want, no matter how           
complicated it is.              

1297
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,521
We've got the Twitter user      
that's showing there, so        

1298
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,424
we can his handle,              
his username, whatever else.    

1299
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,727
We wanna get on him and         
put it in there.                

1300
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:42,297
Everybody got that?             

1301
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,298
Super simple, and               

1302
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,400
yes it is super simple that's   
what's great about in fetch     

1303
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,304
results controller is that      
really the amount of code we    

1304
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,641
actually had to write           
here is absolutely tiny.        

1305
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,244
Now, there is one piece         
left which is update UI so      

1306
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:59,648
when someone sets our           
mention or sets our database,   

1307
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,584
we need to create a fetch       
results controller, obviously.  

1308
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,353
Just can't be nil               
all the time,                   

1309
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,555
we actually have to create      
one and we're just gonna say,   

1310
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:13,495
fetchResultsController = a new  

1311
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,567
NSFetchedResultsController,     
which is for Twitter users.     

1312
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:24,939
And we will use this            
constructor right here.         

1313
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,208
I'll go ahead and               
separate this out so            

1314
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:29,410
you can see a little better     
what the arguments are.         

1315
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,379
Let me see from                 
this slide as well.             

1316
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,182
So what are the four            
things we need?                 

1317
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,486
We need a request,              
I'll make a request.            

1318
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:41,923
We need a context,              
I'll make a context.            

1319
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:46,561
We need the name of             
the var in TwitterUser,         

1320
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,829
that says this section title.   

1321
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,698
Well, we don't have any         
sections all our Twitter users  

1322
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,567
are gonna be shown in           
one big like long list,         

1323
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,003
so that's nil and               
we won't cache our results.     

1324
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:58,473
Although we could, because      
we're never gonna change this   

1325
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:01,375
request--well, actually         
that's not true.                

1326
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,345
We could change this            
because someone might           

1327
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,647
bring up this MVC and           
then change the mention and     

1328
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,949
that would be changing the      
request to look for different   

1329
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,484
twitter users so it's better    
not to catch this beside        

1330
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,221
the results are hopefully       
gonna be fairly small.          

1331
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,123
So I have to do a request       
in context here.                

1332
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,257
Let's do context first.         

1333
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:19,895
I'm gonna say if I can let my   
context equal my containers     

1334
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,631
View context.                   

1335
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,634
Now, this is very               
important right here to use     

1336
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:29,837
view context because            
this is a Ui thing.             

1337
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,473
And this fetch results          
controller is gonna be working  

1338
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,909
with our table view             
controller, that's all UI so    

1339
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,778
we wanna do this all            
in the main queue.              

1340
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,881
So, you have to                 
use view context.               

1341
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,417
You cannot do that              
background thing                

1342
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:43,918
to create your                  
FetchResultController.          

1343
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:47,389
All right, so all that leaves   
is this request here so         

1344
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,758
I'm gonna let the request       
it's obviously going to         

1345
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,829
be an NSFetchRequest for        
Twitter users.                  

1346
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,633
And we use this nice            
convenience thing here          

1347
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:02,571
TwitterUser.FetchRequest and    
so what does our request need?  

1348
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,374
Well, our request needs         
sort descriptors, so            

1349
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,210
we're gonna have to have some   
array of sort descriptors.      

1350
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,279
Our request also                
needs a predicate.              

1351
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:19,153
Predicate.                      

1352
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:25,660
Whoops, gotta get format        
right here, this one.           

1353
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,831
We're gonna have to have some   
format string there, and        

1354
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,067
then some args for              
the percent at signs.           

1355
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,936
So let's do this sort           
descriptor first.               

1356
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,305
We're looking for all the       
Twitter users who have tweeted  

1357
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,507
something that mentioned        
that search for a minute.       

1358
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:43,444
Let's order them by their       
handle, at sign whatever.       

1359
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:47,848
So all we need to do then is    
say, NSSortDescriptor with and  

1360
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,084
we'll use the one               
with the key.                   

1361
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:56,957
It's not, it's going to         
make me type it, arg.           

1362
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:03,364
So we'll do the key handle and  
we'll do ascending true.        

1363
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,299
That's good enough, we'll just  
have it sort however it sorts.  

1364
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,002
We'll come back to sorting      
later and look at it.           

1365
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,704
We only need one sort           
descriptor we're not gonna      

1366
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,573
sort by the a handle and        

1367
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,041
then subsort by something else  
because the handle will be      

1368
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,345
sufficient sorting in there,    
and what about our predicate?   

1369
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,214
What tweeter users              
are we looking for here?        

1370
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,783
This is really the key to       
making anything work and for    

1371
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:23,718
your homework by the way,       

1372
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:28,990
really this homework it's       
not a lot of programming.       

1373
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,792
It's a lot of thinking.         

1374
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,294
Especially designing            
your schema so                  

1375
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:38,065
that this line of code right    
here is really simple.          

1376
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,600
If you design your schema       
properly you can make           

1377
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,501
this quite simple.              

1378
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,838
It's all about thinking about   
what am I actually showing,     

1379
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,307
and how do I calculate          
what those things are.          

1380
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:49,377
In this case I'm showing        
all the Twitter users.          

1381
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:57,718
Any of the twitter users        
here whose tweets,              

1382
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,456
the text in their tweets        
actually, contains, and         

1383
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,126
we'll go case insensitively,    
that search term.               

1384
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:06,494
Our mention.                    

1385
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:08,662
Which is optional, so           
we'd better unwrap.             

1386
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,398
And if I'm gonna                
unwrap this forcibly,           

1387
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,402
I'm actually going to check     
to make sure it's not nil.      

1388
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,940
Just to be careful there.       

1389
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,875
So this is                      
the predicate we want.          

1390
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,612
We want any Twitter user.       

1391
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,014
Because we're looking for       
Twitter users,                  

1392
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,617
any Twitter user who's tweets,  
any of their tweets,            

1393
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:34,956
texts contains this mention.    

1394
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:35,590
This is actually,               

1395
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,292
I probably said that            
a little bit wrong there.       

1396
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,895
We're looking for               
any Twitter user who have any   

1397
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:44,932
of it's tweets text             
contains this mention.          

1398
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,035
Off of any, means here,         
anything, any of the tweets     

1399
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:53,541
texts contains this, then       
show this twitter user here.    

1400
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:56,877
Everybody got all that?         

1401
01:06:56,946 --> 01:07:00,014
So now, I got my fetch          
request controller,             

1402
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,683
remember the only two things    
I need to do now is to          

1403
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:07,221
try to have my fetched results  
controller perform this fetch,  

1404
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:10,324
okay that can throw, so         
that's why we're trying there.  

1405
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,927
And we've got to tell our       
table view, time to go          

1406
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,130
call all of your UI table       
view data source methods, and   

1407
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,799
we know whose going             
to answer that,                 

1408
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,201
that extension that             
we have there.                  

1409
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,436
And it's going to ask fetched   
results controller for          

1410
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:23,838
all the information it needs.   

1411
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:33,014
By the way, notice I made this  
public, (internal, basically).  

1412
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,784
That's because I put            
that extension over here        

1413
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,119
in a different file and         

1414
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:40,755
it wouldn't be a receive        
this otherwise.                 

1415
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,691
So, if you wanna make           
this var private,               

1416
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,094
which is not a bad idea,        
actually.                       

1417
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,762
In a MVC that is using          
a fetchedResultsController,     

1418
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,365
making its controller           
public is kinda opening up      

1419
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,400
the internal guts of it.        

1420
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,703
If you wanna make this          
private, then you would just    

1421
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,605
put this extension at           
the bottom of the file,         

1422
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:58,272
in the same file.               

1423
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,875
That way they you would         
be able to see it.              

1424
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:10,718
Hopefully we've                 
remembered everything,          

1425
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:15,523
let's go give this a try.       

1426
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,393
Let's go here #stanford again.  

1427
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:21,429
Now I'm gonna press Tweeters.   

1428
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,399
And it's going to segue         
to this new MVC that            

1429
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,934
will hopefully show us          
a list of all the people who    

1430
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:27,802
have tweeted here.              

1431
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,069
And sure enough, there it is.   

1432
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,706
These are all the people        
who have tweeted one of         

1433
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,975
the tweets that was found       
by that search team.            

1434
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,310
Search term #stanford.          

1435
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,411
It even has that listed at      
the top, which is kinda cool,   

1436
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,914
because that's the same         
as the back button here.        

1437
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,850
Now, one thing I don't          
like about this,                

1438
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,786
a couple of things,             
one, subtitle.                  

1439
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:46,821
Okay that's no good,            

1440
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,423
we could put something          
better there like,              

1441
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,659
maybe we could put how many     
tweets they've tweeted          

1442
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,561
that match that search term,    
that'd be cool.                 

1443
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,763
And then, the other thing       
is the order its in,            

1444
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:59,100
look at this, all the capital   
letter's first and              

1445
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:03,004
then all the lowercase          
letters after it.               

1446
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:04,505
I want it all to be             
alphabetical case insensitive,  

1447
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:05,939
And like that,                  

1448
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,576
so let's fix those things.      

1449
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,212
So the case insensitive is      
just a matter of sorting.       

1450
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,349
We're sorting there and         
it's sorting by some default,   

1451
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:17,084
while the default is obviously  
case sensitive search and       

1452
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,185
we don't want that.             

1453
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,155
So, this is where this          
sorting selector comes in.      

1454
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:25,326
And we just say #selector and   
it's gotta be an NSString       

1455
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,628
selector because this           
is an NSString field.           

1456
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,063
And there's quite               
a few of them,                  

1457
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:32,733
if you type compare, you'll     
get to see what they are.       

1458
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,603
So, there's                     
a localizedCaseInsensitive,     

1459
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,973
this kind of thing, so,         
let's try CaseInsensitive.      

1460
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,675
Let's do localized case         
insensitive compare.            

1461
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,812
So that's case insensitive,     
and using the user's local      

1462
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:48,783
language to know what goes      
where, what the ordering is.    

1463
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:49,884
So that's a pretty good one,    

1464
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:52,420
to use localized case           
insensitive compare.            

1465
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:54,956
So that's all we need to        
do to the case sensitivity,     

1466
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,824
that was really easy.           

1467
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:01,496
How about this thing of having  
the cells detail text label?    

1468
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,065
Have the twitter account,       

1469
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,034
basically the account           
of tweet.                       

1470
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:13,407
So I'm gonna say this           
equals twitter tweet count.     

1471
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:18,980
Tweet and let's even be nice    
here and put an s if it's one.  

1472
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:23,250
Count equals one.               

1473
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:27,654
Then we'll put an s on the end  
otherwise we're nothing.        

1474
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:28,622
Okay, every one see             
what I did there?               

1475
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,690
So it will take one tweet.      

1476
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,059
What else do we                 
need to do here?                

1477
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:38,732
We'll do this.                  

1478
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,001
All right, so I just want       
to make it look nice.           

1479
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,804
One tweet, two tweets,          
zero tweets.                    

1480
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,738
How do I get this tweet         
count right here and            

1481
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,742
let tweet count                 
equal something?                

1482
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:53,580
And to do this,                 
I'm going to do a little quick  

1483
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:57,518
fast type code, because we're   
getting close to the end here.  

1484
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,588
I have a method here            
called tweet count,             

1485
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,691
with mention by right here.     

1486
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,660
And let's look at this          
method and how this works.      

1487
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:12,133
So this is gonna give           
the tweetCountWithMentionBy     

1488
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,603
this twitterUser, the           
twitterUser that we got from    

1489
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,671
our fetchResultsController.     

1490
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,739
It's gonna give us              
the tweetCount.                 

1491
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,541
And the way it's work is        
it's gonna create a fetch       

1492
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,408
for tweet.                      

1493
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:25,880
So here even in the middle      
of my cellForRowAtIndexPath,    

1494
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,083
I'm making a request perfectly  
valid to go to a fetch          

1495
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:31,285
request right in the middle     
here to find some information.  

1496
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,187
So here I'm fetching for        
Tweets this time,               

1497
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:36,557
cause I wanna count the number  
of Tweets this Twitter user     

1498
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,725
has Tweeted with that so sure.  

1499
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,126
And the predicate is,           

1500
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:44,398
"tell me all the Tweets who's   
text contains that mention".    

1501
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,335
And who's Tweeter is            
this Twitter user?              

1502
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,673
Mention and a twitterUser.      

1503
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:54,241
And I'm gonna go ahead and      
force unwrap that,              

1504
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,577
because, boy if I get all       
the way down to here,           

1505
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,246
surely the mention is not nil.  

1506
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:01,015
And then I'm going to return,   

1507
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:04,351
I'm going to use the same       
context the twitterUser is in,  

1508
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,920
hopefully that's                
a view context.                 

1509
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,224
And I'm going to count,         
use that count thing for        

1510
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:11,559
that request.                   

1511
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,993
And if that fails for           
some reason,                    

1512
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,896
I'm gonna say 0 tweets.         

1513
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,733
Have you got that?              

1514
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:23,671
So let's go                     

1515
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:29,076
take a look.                    

1516
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:32,513
Right, #stanford.               

1517
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:33,681
Right, here it is.              

1518
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:38,419
Tweeters, look at that, not 1   
tweet, 37 tweets from MEC30.    

1519
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:41,021
Let's go see if we can          
find MEC30 in here.             

1520
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,824
Sure, there's one my MEC30,     
another one, sure enough.       

1521
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,392
Look at this ME, what the?      

1522
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:49,530
Okay, what if I decide I don't  
want MEC30 in there anymore.    

1523
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,999
I don't like, this guy is       
a spammer or something.         

1524
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,534
I don't know what               
his problem is.                 

1525
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:54,868
But I don't want him in there.  

1526
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:58,706
Well, I can go back here and    
change my predicate right here  

1527
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:02,309
to say, I want all              
the tweets that have that.      

1528
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:07,881
But I don't want ones where     
the handle of that guy, let's   

1529
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:13,454
say it even begins with, just   
to be kind of interesting MEC.  

1530
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,055
What was it?                    

1531
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,156
MEC, we'll say.                 

1532
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:20,260
And we can't put this           
literal in here, so             

1533
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:26,534
we have to say %@ and then we   
put the MEC on the outside.     

1534
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:31,205
So let's see                    

1535
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:36,277
if that got rid                 

1536
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:40,981
of Mr. MEC.                     

1537
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,418
He gone!                        

1538
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,653
Got that spammer out of there.  

1539
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:47,254
No questions?                   

1540
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:48,489
Yes?                            
Question?                       

1541
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,191
Yeah, so the question is, are   
the tweets in the database,     

1542
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,861
do they stay in there for       
run to run?                     

1543
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,262
And the answer is absolutely,   

1544
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:57,264
that's one,                     
core data is kinda all about.   

1545
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,432
There's a permanent database.   

1546
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:01,535
So all those tweets, those      
#stanford tweets in there,      

1547
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,137
if we go back and run again.    

1548
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,244
And search for #stanford.       

1549
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,712
If there have, you know,        

1550
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,148
been some tweets since          
then they'll be added.          

1551
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:16,717
But every single tweet          
we ever got is still            

1552
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:17,517
going to be in here.            

1553
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,453
So you can see this list        
actually got slightly longer,   

1554
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:21,388
a few tweets were in there,     
but they're all in there.       

1555
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:26,159
we're unique-ing them so it's   
not adding them over and over.  

1556
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,761
And you gotta be careful to     
do that on your homework.       

1557
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,630
Don't add them over and over.   

1558
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,632
But yeah, that CoreData         
database is there.              

1559
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,467
By the way,                     
I'm gonna show you a trick.     

1560
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,569
We just enough time to show     
you something's really cool.    

1561
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,472
What if you want to             
delete your database?           

1562
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:40,507
Okay, now there's two           
reasons you wanna,              

1563
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,641
might wanna delete              
your database.                  

1564
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,844
One, you wanna clear the data   
out cuz you wanna get a fresh   

1565
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,880
set so you can see if           
things are working.             

1566
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:49,416
And number two, you might       
change your data model.         

1567
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:53,453
If I go back here and           
I go to my data model here and  

1568
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,323
I add some attributes or        
add an entity,                  

1569
01:14:56,392 --> 01:15:01,628
then my app will no longer      
run on that device or           

1570
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:05,833
on the simulator cuz it'll say  
your data model doesn't match   

1571
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:07,902
the data that's already         
on this device.                 

1572
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,938
So here's the magic to get rid  
of, it's not very magical.      

1573
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,206
Is on your device, or           

1574
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:15,543
on the simulator, you go to     
the home button right here and  

1575
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:19,413
you press and hold to           
make the things jiggle.         

1576
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:20,280
You all know about that?        

1577
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,648
It's how you delete apps.       

1578
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:25,018
And just delete your app.       

1579
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:28,755
And when you delete your app,   
your core data goes with it.    

1580
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:31,491
And now when you run the next   
time, you're gonna run,         

1581
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,160
it's gonna be                   
a fresh database,               

1582
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,961
it will have the new            
data model etc.                 

1583
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,664
So I'm very glad                
you asked that,                 

1584
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,599
really important to know how    
to clear out your database.     

1585
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:43,070
Now if we do #trump or          
something,                      

1586
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:48,342
see it's even asking me again,  
do I wanna allow it?            

1587
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,143
And I do.                       

1588
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,449
All right, that is it.          

1589
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:58,319
I will see you next Wednesday   
after you turn in your          

1590
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,252
homework and                    

1591
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:04,691
we'll learn all about the       
final project in Autolayout.    

1592
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:14,768
