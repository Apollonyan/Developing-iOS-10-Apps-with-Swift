00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:04,535
[MUSIC]                         

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,838
Stanford University.            

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:11,109
>> All right, well,             
welcome to Stanford CS193P.     

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:16,980
This is Developing iOS          
Application, Winter of 2017.    

5
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,983
And the only topic for          
today is a big one, Core Data,  

6
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:23,019
which is an object              
oriented database.              

7
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,821
But before I dive into this,    

8
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:28,324
I'm actually going to revisit   
that demo we did last time      

9
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:31,260
just briefly, because we        
ran out of time and so          

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,262
I wasn't able to show           
you the refresh control.        

11
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,797
Now I posted the code for       
it, so                          

12
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,066
I'm not gonna type              
all the code in here.           

13
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:40,701
But I'm just gonna              
briefly show you                

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,270
how that refresh                
control worked, okay?           

15
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:45,171
Okay, so we missed that.        

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,907
So here is the app we           
had from last time.             

17
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:50,977
By the way,                     
I have modified our app         

18
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,045
here to change our              
request a little bit.           

19
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:55,347
If you remember this line       
of code from last time,         

20
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,815
it used to just                 
have the query.                 

21
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:00,718
But I've changed it to also     
filter out retweets and         

22
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:04,188
I've also put on the safe       
filter, which hopefully will    

23
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,624
make it so                      
that when I do these look ups,  

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,227
these sort of up looks, we      
don't get stuff on the screen,  

25
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,129
you know this is                
a family show,                  

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,331
so we don't want to see         
some of that stuff.             

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,666
Anyway, hopefully,              
that'll work.                   

28
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:19,735
So let's go back here and       

29
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:22,571
take a look at what             
this looks like.                

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,272
There's my simulator            
right here.                     

31
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,273
So let's go ahead and search.   

32
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:29,710
Let's try Trump again and       
cross our fingers, all right.   

33
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:34,949
So that's not, I don't see      
anything too terrible there.    

34
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:38,752
Okay so what we added was this  
UI where we can pull down.      

35
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,153
Okay and it adds more tweets,   

36
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,888
you see how it added            
a tweet there?                  

37
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,589
We have the second              
pull right there,               

38
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:44,724
this was with the first pull.   

39
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:49,895
And we pull down again,         
no tweets this time, okay?      

40
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:52,431
So each time we pull down       
it's doing another twitter      

41
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:53,497
fetch, and                      

42
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:57,268
may get more tweets depending   
if people are tweeting or not.  

43
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:59,503
So let's take a look at         
the code to do this, again,     

44
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,004
I posted this code, but         

45
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,539
we'll just look at it,          
I'm not gonna type it all in,   

46
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,207
we're just gonna look           
at it real quick.               

47
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:07,042
First of all, let's talk about  
how do I get this UI where      

48
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,280
we pull down and it calls       
a method, or whatever?          

49
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,150
So let's go to look             
in our storyboard.              

50
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:19,787
All right, so                   
here's our storyboard, and      

51
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,691
what I did was I just selected  
my table view controller and    

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,193
I went down here to             
this refreshing.                

53
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,360
You see that                    
refreshing choice?              

54
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:30,864
And I changed it from disabled  
to enabled, and when I set it   

55
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,466
to enabled nothing              
changed here in the UI.         

56
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:36,436
You can't see any               
spinning thing, but             

57
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:40,072
over here in the document       
outline it created this         

58
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,340
refresh control right here.     

59
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,977
And so I can control drag from  
the document outline just as I  

60
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,145
can through here.               

61
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,680
So all I did to make this       
work is I just brought up       

62
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:52,082
my controller right here.       

63
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,784
And here's the method I         
did it with right here.         

64
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:58,188
I just Ctrl dragged from the    
Refresh Control to this method  

65
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,590
called refresh, okay?           

66
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,360
That's all I did to,            
to make that happen.            

67
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,627
And inside refresh,             

68
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:08,363
I just called that same method  
I had before, searchForTweets.  

69
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:10,698
This one right here, the one    
that search for tweets.         

70
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,533
And that used to                
look like this,                 

71
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,368
I only changed one              
thing in here.                  

72
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:17,805
It used to just get             
the twitterRequest by           

73
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,873
looking at our                  
search term up here.            

74
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,475
Remember this function?         

75
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:25,144
And all I did was added this,   
which says, if                  

76
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,849
the lastTwitterRequest has a    
newer version, then use that.   

77
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,319
But if it doesn't, then         
default back to doing to query  

78
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,053
request the way we used to.     

79
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,355
The only other things that I    
had to do was turn the refresh  

80
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,524
control off, you do that        
with the end refreshing.        

81
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:42,159
So I just did that when I went  
back to the main queue here,    

82
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,328
to get my results,              
so I turned it off.             

83
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:45,562
I also turned it off if for     

84
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,265
some reason I couldn't get      
any request or whatsoever.      

85
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,634
Okay, there's nothing in        
the search term field and       

86
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:53,002
I couldn't get a newer          
version of my last request.     

87
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,771
So I just said, I'm gonna       
make sure that thing is not     

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,940
spinning and spinning forever.  

89
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,374
They wanna get out              
of here with that.              

90
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:02,110
And the only other thing        
I had to do was up here,        

91
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:05,813
when the search text changes,   
someone types#Stanford or       

92
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:09,250
something like that, I need to  
invalidate that last Twitter    

93
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,152
request so that it's not        
trying to get new versions      

94
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,920
of the previous                 
one that I had.                 

95
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,589
I want it to do the new one.    

96
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,226
And the way that I made it so   
that we had these little        

97
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:24,296
titles right here, see these    
titles two, three, four, five?  

98
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,132
I implemented another UI table  
view data source method,        

99
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,900
this one down here.             

100
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,203
Called                          
titleForHeaderInSection.        

101
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,437
I just put titles               
on the sections.                

102
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,974
Remember, each section is       
another pull from Twitter.      

103
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,642
And so I just have each title.  

104
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,377
It's actually gonna be the      
count of things I had minus     

105
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,312
the section number.             

106
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,146
So the top one                  
is section zero.                

107
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:45,814
So section zero is gonna show   

108
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:47,115
the number of pulls             
that I've made.                 

109
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:48,516
tweets.count is how             
many pulls I made.              

110
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,151
And it's obviously gonna        

111
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,853
decrement as                    
the sections go down.           

112
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:57,391
Okay, so                        
that's what gave us this.       

113
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,892
And you can see that            
the longer we wait,             

114
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,661
obviously it pulls              
more information,               

115
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,829
as tweets pile up.              

116
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,334
Okay, let's go back             
to our slides.                  

117
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:10,202
All right, here we go.          

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,871
So Core Data is this big        
framework inside of iOS for     

119
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,574
doing object-oriented           
databases.                      

120
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:19,409
So let's talk a little bit      
about what that means.          

121
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,545
So, when do you                 
need a database?                

122
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,814
Well you need a database when   
you have a large amount of      

123
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:26,916
data, and especially if you     
want to kind of make queries    

124
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,153
into that data and find out     
things about that data and      

125
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,654
the relationships between       
all the things in there.        

126
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,089
You really can't                
do that by like,                

127
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:36,558
taking a big dictionary or      
a big array and                 

128
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,627
searching through it,           
you need a database.            

129
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:42,797
And so there's a lot of         
technologies for databases out  

130
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,766
there but most of them          
are not object-oriented.        

131
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:48,769
So we have this framework       
that Apple provides called      

132
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,705
Core Data, it's what we call    
an object-oriented database     

133
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:55,108
but actually, it's really not   
an object-oriented database     

134
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,976
on the inside.                  

135
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,411
It's only an object-oriented    
database on the outside.        

136
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,247
The side that you look at.      

137
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:04,950
Underneath, it's actually       
a relational database usually.  

138
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:08,987
Now Core Data is designed to    
have any backend of storage.    

139
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:11,589
But it's primary                
implementation is on top of     

140
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:13,957
SQL which is                    
a relational database.          

141
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:18,061
How many people know            
what SQL Database is?           

142
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,396
Okay, almost all of you, good.  

143
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:25,268
So, if we had to do databases   
in our iOS apps using SQL,      

144
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,870
we'd be like no, I have         
to learn this whole query       

145
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,705
language, and                   
how am I gonna do this?         

146
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,708
Not to worry, we don't have to  
know any SQL to use core Data.  

147
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,543
No SQL whatsoever- we're        
just gonna purely do this       

148
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,280
on the object side.             

149
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:39,380
So how does this work?          

150
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,380
How does core Data work?        

151
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,551
Well, first we're gonna         
create a visual mapping         

152
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,985
between things in               
our database and                

153
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,688
some objects that we're gonna   
be able to program with         

154
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,791
in our object-oriented          
code that we like.              

155
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,793
And kinda roughly, it's         

156
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:58,597
the tables in the database      
are kinda gonna be objects.     

157
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,833
And the columns in              
the tables are kind of vars.    

158
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:04,069
But we don't even really        
care what it's doing there.     

159
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,737
What we're gonna focus          
on is this visual map,          

160
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:10,607
this visual description         
basically of our schema.        

161
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,509
Okay, how many people know      
what the word schema means?     

162
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:15,812
Okay, so two-thirds of you.     

163
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,748
So schema is basically          
the description of what's       

164
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:22,218
in your database, not the       
contents of it but how all its  

165
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,687
data types are and how they     
relate to each other, etc.      

166
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:27,923
So we're gonna do all           
that graphically.               

167
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:30,325
And this is what                
it looks like.                  

168
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,428
First, if I wanna use           
Core Data in my app,            

169
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:37,498
I'm almost certainly going      
to wanna click this button      

170
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,366
that says Use Core Data.        

171
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,869
We've seen it every time we've  
created an app, and we haven't  

172
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,870
clicked it so far, but          
now we are going to click it.   

173
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,872
And clicking                    
Use Core Data there,            

174
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,875
is gonna create two things for  
us, this visual map,            

175
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:50,943
and some code in                
your App Delegate.              

176
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,878
And I'm gonna talk about        
both of those things.           

177
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,112
Now before I go to              
the next slide,                 

178
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,948
notice that the name of this    
app is CoreDataExample.         

179
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,317
That's the, just the name of    
the app that I typed in there.  

180
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:03,386
So when I create this app,      
clicking that                   

181
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:06,790
Use Core Data on, you'll see    
that it created this file,      

182
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:10,260
CoreDataExample.xcdatamodeld.   

183
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,395
So it chose the name            
of my app as it.                

184
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:16,332
And this is going to be         
our data model, all right?      

185
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,433
And so we'll, we'll talk        
about the AppDelegate           

186
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,570
code that Use Core Data also    
generated a little bit later.   

187
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,473
Right now we're gonna focus     
on this data model file.        

188
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,977
All right, but before we even   
do that, what happens if we     

189
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:32,413
have an existing app and you    
did not click Use Core Data?    

190
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,748
And now you decided, hey,       
I wanna add core data.          

191
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:38,318
Like maybe Smashtag Assignment  
5 comes out and                 

192
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,953
I tell you to add some          
Core Data to Smashtag.          

193
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,789
And you're like, woh,           
I can't go back and             

194
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,690
click Use Core Data,            
it's too late.                  

195
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,726
So you're gonna have to         
create this data model file     

196
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,827
using new file.                 

197
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,463
So you just go to File          
> New > File like this.         

198
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,830
You're not gonna pick any of    

199
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,465
the things we've picked so      
far.                            

200
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,600
You're gonna scroll down        
to the section that             

201
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,401
says Core Data.                 

202
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,669
And inside there these,         
there's two things,             

203
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,137
Data Model and Mapping Model.   

204
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:04,406
And make sure you pick Data     
Model because that's what you   

205
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:06,775
want to do here is              
create your data model,         

206
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:09,511
your schema essentially,        
for your database.              

207
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,179
It's gonna ask you              
what you wanna call it.         

208
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,948
Now, you don't have to call     
this the same as the name of    

209
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,484
your application like           
Use Core Data button does.      

210
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,584
You can call it                 
anything you want.              

211
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:20,220
So here, just to be different,  
I've called it Model,           

212
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,955
it's my model.                  

213
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,355
And by the way,                 

214
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:27,994
your core data is usually       
the model of a lot of MVCs.     

215
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:31,429
Okay, a lot of MVCs, their      
job is going to be to display   

216
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:35,167
the data in the database, and   
so this data model is actually  

217
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,568
the MVC model as well for       
a lot of MVCs.                  

218
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,737
So I'll call this one model,    
and                             

219
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,773
you can see it created          
model.xedatamodeld.             

220
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:46,477
So whether you get that file    
by doing Use Core Data or       

221
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,445
whether you get it by           
creating it yourself,           

222
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:51,281
you're gonna have               
this mapping file.              

223
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,017
Now, let me go back to          
that AppDelegate thing.         

224
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,819
I said they was gonna put some  
code in your AppDelegate.       

225
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,954
It's very small                 
amount of code.                 

226
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:01,089
But I wanted to show            
it to you right here.           

227
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,891
This is what it looks like.     

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,794
It just creates this            
one var right here.             

229
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:10,130
By the way, if you didn't do    
Use Core Data, of course,       

230
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,198
you need this code              
in your AppDelegate,            

231
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,799
how are you gonna get it?       

232
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:16,669
Just go create some             
dummy application.              

233
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,405
Call it Foo, it doesn't really  
matter what you call it.        

234
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:21,707
Click Use Core Data             
when you create it and          

235
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:24,610
then copy this code from        
that AppDelegate to here.       

236
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:27,913
Okay, the code is               
identical from every app.       

237
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:31,115
The only difference between     
any of those things is this     

238
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,549
one string right here.          

239
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:33,384
You see that string?            

240
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:36,253
That's the name of              
that xcmodeld file, so          

241
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,520
datamodeld file.                

242
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,021
So with our core data example,  

243
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,190
this string would               
be CoreDataExample.             

244
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,692
When we went back and created   
it on our own with new file,    

245
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:45,093
of course, we called it Model.  

246
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:49,130
So just make sure this string   
matches the name of the file,   

247
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:53,100
the xcmodel datamodeld file,    
okay?                           

248
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,736
So that's what you need to      
do if you didn't do the use     

249
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,805
Code Data originally            
you are going back and          

250
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,038
adding it- just copy and        
paste.                          

251
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:03,509
It's only this one var really,  
it does provide another thing   

252
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,946
in your AppDelegate which is    
a function called saveContext.  

253
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,147
It's a very simple              
little function.                

254
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:11,016
I'm gonna show you how you      
could write it yourself.        

255
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,918
If you wanna copy it in,        
you can.                        

256
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,321
Also I notice that they have    
applicationWillTerminate which  

257
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,790
is this application,            
AppDelegate method,             

258
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,592
that gets called right          
before you get terminated or    

259
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,594
you terminate it in any way     
and they call saveContext.      

260
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,129
Well, it's a kind of an idea,   
a good idea.                    

261
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:28,198
saveContext() just              
saves your database.            

262
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,566
That's what saveContext does,   
all right?                      

263
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,903
So this is how you can make     
up if you didn't do it.         

264
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:37,139
So anyway, you can see that     
the only thing in here          

265
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,641
is this lazy var                
persistentContainer, and        

266
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,209
I'm gonna talk all about        
persistentContainer,            

267
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:43,677
because that's the thing        
that essentially contains       

268
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,346
your database, all right?       

269
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,215
But let's go back and           
talk about the visual map.      

270
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,084
Cuz we have to have a visual    
map before we can do anything   

271
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:53,853
in our database because we      
have to have some things in     

272
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,556
our database, some objects and  
things like that.               

273
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,292
And Core database stores        
things in this kind of very     

274
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,027
straightforward way.            

275
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:05,764
It looks very object-oriented   
in our code because             

276
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,466
in Core Data terms              
it's storing entities,          

277
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:11,235
which look like                 
classes to our code.            

278
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:14,872
Attributes, which look          
like vars on our classes.       

279
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,242
And relationship, which just    
look like vars that point to    

280
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,279
other objects in the database,  
other entities, etc.            

281
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,181
And so we're gonna use this     
what I'm calling a storyboard.  

282
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,081
It's not, don't get confused,   

283
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,716
this is not a storyboard,       
okay?                           

284
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,319
You know what a storyboard is,  
your Interface Builder thing.   

285
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:32,087
But it's kind of                
like a storyboard,              

286
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,823
that's why it's in quotes for   
databases.                      

287
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:37,224
It's a graphical,               
visual editor to create and     

288
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:40,427
describe all these entities,    
attributes and relationships,   

289
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:42,896
okay, that's what               
we're gonna do here.            

290
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,098
So let's start by               
adding an entity.               

291
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,034
Very easy, we go down to this   
button on the bottom here       

292
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,502
called Add Entity.              

293
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,103
Okay, to add an entity.         

294
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,305
By the way, there's couple      
other things in that if you     

295
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,807
hold down on that button        
you'll see Add Fetch Request,   

296
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,774
and Add Configuration.          

297
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,642
I don't have time to talk       
about those unfortunately,      

298
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,345
but especially Add Fetch        
Request is kind of a cool one.  

299
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,247
So, if you can take what I      
teach you here and extend it    

300
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,350
by going and learning about     
that, that would be great.      

301
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,884
So you click Add Entity,        

302
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,754
it creates a new                
entity called Entity.           

303
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,822
Cuz it doesn't know what        
name you want for it yet.       

304
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,491
And like I say,                 
this analogous to a class.      

305
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,295
Now in our code we're gonna     
see any instances of this       

306
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:24,432
entity as instances of a class  
called NSManagedObject.         

307
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,235
So NSManagedObject super        
important in Core Data.         

308
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,804
It is the super class or        
the class of everything that    

309
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:32,773
comes, all these entities that  
come out of the database.       

310
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:36,142
It's like the thing that        
represents them in our code,    

311
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,710
and we'll see all about that.   

312
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,679
So for my kind of slides here,  

313
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,715
what I'm gonna do is create     
a database that would have      

314
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:45,384
stuff like we got               
from Twitter.                   

315
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:46,952
So it's gonna have tweets and   

316
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,086
we're gonna have                
Twitter users.                  

317
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,954
So those are gonna be two       
entities that we have and       

318
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:52,223
you're gonna see eventually,    
we're gonna have Tweet and      

319
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,557
TwitterUser classes             
in our code and                 

320
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,258
we're gonna access vars and     
all that stuff.                 

321
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,126
So I'm gonna rename             
this entity,                    

322
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:59,828
this, that I added that         
was defaulted to entity,        

323
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,331
I'm gonna rename it and         
call it Tweet.                  

324
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,934
So this is gonna be the first   
entity that I'm creating        

325
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,568
in the database.                

326
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,837
Now, an entity can              
have attributes.                

327
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:11,005
Those are kind of like vars,    
and relationships.              

328
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:14,108
Those are like vars that        
point to other entities.        

329
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:16,276
And I told you this fetched     
properties down at the bottom,  

330
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:17,144
I'm not gonna talk about.       

331
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,078
Very cool, but                  
not gonna talk about them.      

332
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:21,047
Not just time-wise.             

333
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,315
So let's go and add some        
attributes to this entity.      

334
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,783
Real easy,                      
you click this plus button,     

335
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,284
there's also                    
an Add Attribute button,        

336
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:28,419
see it down in the lower        
right hand corner there.        

337
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,954
But I'm gonna click             
this little plus                

338
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:33,290
button right there under        
the section called Attributes.  

339
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:36,059
And when I do there it adds a   
new attribute called attribute  

340
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,927
and I'm gonna edit              
its name directly,              

341
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,495
just like I did                 
the entity name.                

342
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:40,663
I'm gonna change                
this to be text.                

343
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:45,268
So, this is gonna be our tweet  
text, the 140 characters        

344
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:49,438
of the tweet is gonna be        
this particular attribute.      

345
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,008
Now, notice as soon as I        
did that, I got an error.       

346
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,476
In the corner there,            
this red error.                 

347
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,043
And the reason for              

348
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,846
that is all attributes          
have to have a type.            

349
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:01,182
They can't just be undefined    
type like this one is.          

350
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,350
You see where it says           
the type is undefined.          

351
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,919
So, we need to change           
that to be a type.              

352
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,721
And it's really easy, right     
there where it says undefined.  

353
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,122
We're just going                
to mouse down,                  

354
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,924
it's gonna bring up a menu and  
we can choose our type.         

355
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:15,393
Now, these are the types        
we have to choose from.         

356
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,663
A lot of different numeric      
types like 16-bit integers,     

357
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:20,164
32-bit integer, etc.            

358
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,900
Doubles, floats,                
can a be string of course,      

359
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:28,605
a Boolean value, a date which   
is going to look like a date,   

360
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:32,142
you know,                       
the date struct in our code.    

361
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,445
And binary data which is gonna  
look like the data struct       

362
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,513
inside our code.                

363
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:39,782
So, these are gonna map to      
very familiar data types        

364
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:40,849
that we see.                    

365
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:42,317
There is that one at            
the bottom there,               

366
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:44,919
transformable, another thing    
I'm not gonna talk about.       

367
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:48,322
But transformable allows        
you to store anything           

368
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,592
into the database by            
converting it to a data, and    

369
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,326
then converting it              
back on the way out.            

370
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:54,728
And so if you pick              
transformable there,            

371
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,729
you're gonna have to            
do some extra work.             

372
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:59,599
To tell Core Data about that    
transformation, and that's why  

373
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,001
I don't really have time to     
tell you about, but just know   

374
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,003
that if you wanted to store     
something like a CGRect.        

375
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:07,539
Actually, if I was going to     
store a CGRect, I might use     

376
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:09,841
the function, there's some      
function called something like  

377
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,143
NSStringFromCGRect.             

378
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,278
It gives you a string, and      

379
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,112
then there's                    
NSCGRectFromString or           

380
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:16,746
something like that.            

381
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,047
So I'd probably store           
it as a string,                 

382
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:20,482
but if I had something more     
complicated than that,          

383
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,783
then I might use                
a transformable.                

384
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:27,388
All right, these attributes     
here are going to be accessed,  

385
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:29,390
we're gonna get and             
set their values.               

386
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,159
Well actually, we're not going  
to do this but fundamentally    

387
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,595
the way you do it is you        
have these two methods,         

388
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:36,430
value(forKey) and               
setValue (forKey).              

389
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,598
And I'll talk about how         
we're gonna use that, but       

390
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:43,036
that's how we're gonna set and  
get the values on an entity.    

391
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,971
Notice the error went           
away as soon as we              

392
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,239
gave this thing, a type.        

393
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:50,709
So here I'm gonna add some      
more attributes, identifier,    

394
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,978
which is just some string       
that identifies the tweet and   

395
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,714
then created,                   
which was when it was tweeted.  

396
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:00,251
Notice I'm setting created's    
type here to be date because    

397
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,287
it is a date, obviously,        
when the thing was created.     

398
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,189
Now this is one way to look at  
our entities and attributes,    

399
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,257
this kind of table form.        

400
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,859
But we can actually look at     
it in graphical form as well.   

401
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,094
If you see down in the corner   
where it says editor style.     

402
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,829
If I click on                   
the other button there,         

403
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,965
the one that looks a little     
more like a graph,              

404
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:17,832
then it shows me                
the same thing but              

405
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:18,867
in this graphical form.         

406
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:21,335
It's even on graph paper,       
all right?                      

407
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,105
And in this form                
right here we can do            

408
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,806
all the things that we          
did in the other one.           

409
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,941
For example,                    
I can still add entity here.    

410
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,543
So I'm gonna add another        
entity for my Twitter User,     

411
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,244
this is people who tweet.       

412
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,112
And there it is,                
it called it entity again,      

413
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,280
that's the default.             

414
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:38,583
We'll set its name              
to be TwitterUser.              

415
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,986
All right, so we now have two   
entities, you see on there.     

416
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:44,289
What's kinda cool is as you     
drag these entities around,     

417
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:47,191
this, this kind of editor,      
this graphical                  

418
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:49,727
editor, will automatically      
kind of keep them spaced apart  

419
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:50,594
from each other.                

420
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,595
Which is kind of fun,           
especially since they're going  

421
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:54,497
to start having wires           
connecting them because         

422
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,332
they're going to start          
having relationships            

423
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,668
to each other as you're         
going to see in a moment.       

424
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:02,871
We can add attributes in this   
graphical style as well- you    

425
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,874
can edit those right in there   
just by double clicking on      

426
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,809
them, change                    
whatever you want.              

427
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:11,078
So, here I got a screenName,    
now of course I got an error    

428
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:14,014
again because I didn't set      
the type of that screenName.    

429
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,350
So, in this view you set        
the types by bringing up        

430
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,017
the inspector.                  

431
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,286
So you just bring up            
your normal inspector,          

432
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,553
attribute inspector.            

433
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,755
And the, here you can see       
it's inspecting screenName,     

434
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:25,357
it's got the name there.        

435
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,625
There's some other things       
in here like transient,         

436
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:28,626
indexed, optional.              

437
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:31,395
By the way, that optional       
doesn't mean this is optional   

438
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,664
like the Swift thing optional.  

439
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:37,233
This is optional like in        
SQL database terms, right.      

440
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:39,469
In relational                   
database optional.              

441
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:42,004
So I'm not gonna talk           
about any of the database       

442
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,539
You rarely need to set any of   
these properties right here.    

443
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,006
stuff of it.                    

444
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:47,942
But you do need                 
to set the type.                

445
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:49,143
So we're not gonna              
talk about that, but            

446
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,279
we have to set                  
the type right here.            

447
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,280
And the screenName,             
of course, is a string.         

448
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,116
So I'm just gonna               
change it to a string.          

449
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:59,652
I'm adding another attribute    
to the TwitterUser,             

450
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,056
this one is the name,           
the person's actual name,       

451
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,458
not their @ sign handle,        
but their actual name.          

452
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:09,327
Now we've built a couple        
of entities with a bunch of     

453
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,030
attributes on them, okay,       
and this is gonna look like     

454
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,767
classes with vars in            
our code eventually.            

455
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:19,003
But what about relationships,   
obviously a Tweet and           

456
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:22,774
a TwitterUser have              
a relationship to each other.   

457
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,209
And to create relationships     
between things we just          

458
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,145
Ctrl+drag, this is our          
favorite gesture in Xcode and   

459
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:28,945
we're using it again.           

460
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:31,780
Ctrl+drag to create             
a relationship                  

461
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,648
between two things.             

462
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:36,151
And it actually doesn't matter  
which direction you Ctrl+drag,  

463
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,820
because you're creating         
kind of a bidirectional         

464
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,388
relationship.                   

465
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,057
So here, I did Ctrl+drag, and   
it automatically created this   

466
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:47,829
relationship, which it called   
newRelationship on both sides.  

467
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:52,766
And this relationship is        
essentially just gonna be       

468
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,768
a var in our class.             

469
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:59,071
But the var's type is either    
going to be the type, if it's   

470
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,508
like a Tweet, you know,         
it's gonna be a single one, or  

471
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,343
it could be an NSSet,           
if it's many of them.           

472
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,679
Like a Twitter user might       
have many tweets, and           

473
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,781
I'll talk about                 
that in a moment.               

474
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:12,383
So, from a Tweet's perspective  
this relationship to            

475
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,419
a TwitterUser is the Tweeter.   

476
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,821
The person who                  
tweeted this tweet.             

477
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:19,557
So, I'm going to change the     
name of this relationship on    

478
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:24,027
the Tweet side to be tweeter    
instead of newRelationship,     

479
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:25,361
which was the default.          

480
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,763
But, on the other, okay, so     
that's why I call it tweeter.   

481
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,865
On the other side               
the TwitterUser from its        

482
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:33,502
perspective though, okay, the   
relationship of the tweet is    

483
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,737
the tweets that this            
Twitter user has tweeted.       

484
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,840
Okay, it's not tweeter, the     
Twitter user is the tweeter,    

485
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,342
so he would never call          
this relationship tweeter.      

486
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,277
He's gonna call this            
relationship tweets             

487
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,213
because this is the tweet.      

488
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,748
Now notice that's plural,       
okay,                           

489
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,583
we'll talk about                
that in a second.               

490
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:54,186
Notice that when we do this,    
Xcode tracks if I'm inspecting  

491
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,423
the tweet's relationship there  
on the TwitterUser side,        

492
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,858
it knows the inverse.           

493
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,759
It knows that tweeter goes      
the opposite direction,         

494
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,828
there's always gonna be         
an inverse relationship.        

495
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,264
So let's talk about that        
tweets being a plural right?    

496
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,100
So a tweet can only             
have one tweeter.               

497
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,002
Only one person can             
have tweeted it, but            

498
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,873
a Twitter user can tweet        
thousands of tweets, okay?      

499
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,474
And so                          
that's a little different       

500
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:19,374
kind of relationship.           

501
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:21,410
So how do we specify that?      

502
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,679
We call the tweets              
relationship the,               

503
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:27,915
a to many relationship          
because obviously the Twitter   

504
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,951
user can have many tweets.      

505
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,953
So that's called to many        
in database parlance, and       

506
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:34,321
you set that right              
in the Inspector.               

507
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,123
So you just click               
on that tweets and              

508
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:37,690
you go over here to             
where it says Type,             

509
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,927
and instead of having it be     
To One you're gonna change it   

510
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,962
to be To Many, okay, so now     
it's a to many relationship.    

511
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:49,568
Right there, you can see that   
it's changed a little bit as,   

512
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,336
and we'll show                  
that in a second.               

513
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:54,339
But the type of this            
relationship now on the tweet   

514
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:57,909
side is still type              
NSManagedObject,                

515
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:00,111
because it points to another    
entity in the database.         

516
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,279
And we know that                
the objects in the database     

517
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,081
are represented by              
an NSManagedObject.             

518
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,783
So that's gonna be              
the type of that var.           

519
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,118
Although we're eventually       
gonna make it even better than  

520
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:11,420
that, but                       
on the other side though,       

521
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:17,493
the type of that var is NSSet   
of NSManagedObject, okay?       

522
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:23,598
Now NSSet, there is             
a Swift struct called set.      

523
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,766
It's a generic type, it's just  
like an array where you have    

524
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:26,667
to say what's in an array,      

525
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,270
same thing with a set you       
have to say what's in it.       

526
00:22:29,338 --> 00:22:33,240
NSSet is kind of an older       
Objective-C kind of set.        

527
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,375
It's not generic,               
it's untyped.                   

528
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:39,212
The things in NSSet are any,    
which we kinda need a little    

529
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:42,214
bit here cuz we really don't    
know what kinds of things       

530
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:43,149
are in there.                   

531
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:47,619
However, in your code you       
can cast from this NSSet        

532
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:51,656
of NSManagedObject to a set of  
what you know to be in there    

533
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,158
using as question mark, and     

534
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,293
if that in fact is what's       
in there, it will work.         

535
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,462
So that's the NSSet there.      

536
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:01,164
One last thing I'm gonna        
show you here before            

537
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:04,300
we get back to the slides       
is this Delete Rule.            

538
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,268
You see the delete              
rule on the,                    

539
00:23:06,337 --> 00:23:10,005
clicked on tweets on here so    
we're inspecting tweets.        

540
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:13,608
And this delete rule            
tells you what happens          

541
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:17,979
to the pointed-to tweets if     
we deleted this Twitter user.   

542
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:19,880
Cuz if I delete                 
this Twitter user,              

543
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:23,417
does that mean I delete all     
of the Twitter user's tweets?   

544
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,287
Well, it depends on this        
delete rule right here.         

545
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:27,821
this delete rule is saying      
nullify, which would mean no.   

546
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,288
So right now,                   

547
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:32,091
Those tweets would stay in the  
database, and their tweeter     

548
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,261
will be set to nil because      
their tweeter got deleted.      

549
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,829
But there is a cascading        
delete rule, which would say    

550
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:40,332
if I delete this thing then     
delete everything that it       

551
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:42,367
points to, just go right        
down the graph and              

552
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:43,434
delete everything.              

553
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:46,170
So that's what controls what    
happens when you delete.        

554
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,405
Now I'm not gonna ask           
you to even do delete;          

555
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:51,141
I guess I might ask you an      
extra credit to do delete in    

556
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:52,141
assignment five.                

557
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,744
Because deletion kinda-         
you're really gonna know what   

558
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,612
you're doing- when you          
can delete things, and          

559
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,413
what kind of delete             
rules you want.                 

560
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:00,215
But I just want to let          
you know that you specify       

561
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:02,317
the delete rule right           
here in the inspector.          

562
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:07,955
Okay, now that you've defined   
all your entities, attributes   

563
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:11,792
in relationships, then what     
can we do with these things?    

564
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:15,462
Well to do anything with it     
we need to get a hold of them   

565
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:18,531
in our code,                    
grab onto them basically, and   

566
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,466
to do that we need              
another important class,        

567
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,502
NSManagedObjectContext, so      
I told you                      

568
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,071
all those things in the         
database are NSManagedObjects,  

569
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,206
you need                        
an NSManagedObjectContext,      

570
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:32,009
which represents a database     
to do anything with them,       

571
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,578
to get any of them,             
to create any of them, etc,     

572
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,381
this is the hub around which    
Core Data activity turns,       

573
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:38,615
as I say there.                 

574
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:41,185
So how do I get one of these    
NSManagedObjectContext?         

575
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:43,920
And the answer is, you need     
a persistentContainer.          

576
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:46,623
Woo-hoo, and you know           
where to get one of those.      

577
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,190
You just click,                 
Use Core Data, and              

578
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,858
it's gonna appear in            
your AppDelegate.               

579
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,693
You're gonna get                
that lazy var,                  

580
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:53,461
that's called                   
persistentContainer.            

581
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,262
And that is gonna be            
a persistentContainer.          

582
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,431
And from that you               
can get the context.            

583
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:00,568
Now, if you have the lazy       
var in your AppDelegate,        

584
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,636
How the heck do                 
you call that var?              

585
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,003
How do you get that var?        

586
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:05,571
And this is how you do it,      
okay?                           

587
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,009
You get a copy of the shared    
UIApplication, now,             

588
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,678
we didn't talk about this but   
your app has this one and       

589
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:16,415
only UIApplication object that  
represents your application     

590
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:19,784
and you get it by doing         
UIApplication.shared,           

591
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:20,919
it's a var.                     

592
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,887
Static var in                   
UIApplication class.            

593
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:24,955
Gives you the shared one.       

594
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,191
Then you're gonna access this   
var in UIApplication which is   

595
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,159
its delegate.                   

596
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,762
Now, its delegate is            
automatically set up for        

597
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,597
you to be this Swift class      
AppDelegate that you see        

598
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,999
always; we always put it        
off in Supporting Files and     

599
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,134
get it out of our way,          
but it's created for you,       

600
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,035
it's a nice little class.       

601
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,604
We're going to talk about the   
application life cycle, and     

602
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:46,707
where it fits in, in a little   
bit, but for now all            

603
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,542
you need to know is you can     
get AppDelegate, and you want   

604
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,845
to send persistentContainer     
to it to get that var, but of   

605
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:57,450
course you have to as it to be  
the AppDelegate class first.    

606
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,885
So this is the code             
you're going to use.            

607
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:01,120
(UIApplication.shared.delegate  
as!                             

608
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,956
AppDelegate) All that           
in one expression               

609
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,758
dot persistentContainer         
now you're gonna get this       

610
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:09,794
persistentContainer, and        
notice I'm doing as             

611
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,863
exclamation point this will     
crash if my App Delegate is     

612
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:15,866
not in fact App Delegate,       
but it's already wired up       

613
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,669
to be that for you when         
you create a new project,       

614
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,103
so that should                  
never be a problem.             

615
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:21,770
Okay?                           
So                              

616
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,640
now I have this                 
persistentContainer,            

617
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,275
I need to get                   
the context out of it.          

618
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:28,643
And, so,                        

619
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:33,281
the container has an awesome    
var called viewContext.         

620
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,684
And the viewContext is an       
NSManagedObjectContext that's   

621
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:39,620
only suitable for               
use on the main queue.          

622
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:40,520
This is in red,                 

623
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:42,956
you know whenever you see       
anything in red on my slides,   

624
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:45,191
this means pay attention,       
it will matter for              

625
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,960
your homework,                  
and in life, but                

626
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:51,029
you can only use this           
viewContext in the main queue,  

627
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:54,333
it called viewContext because   
you use it with your views,     

628
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:57,869
okay, your UI views, that's     
why we call it viewContext.     

629
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:02,773
So why do I make a point        
about this main queue?          

630
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:05,809
Well, the reason I do that is   
because NSManagedObjectContext  

631
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,744
is not thread-safe.             

632
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:10,747
But I'm gonna talk you, talk    
to you about how we can do      

633
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,883
multithreaded database stuff    
towards the end of this talk.   

634
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,552
All right, so now you have      
this viewContext then you can   

635
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,020
use it to do things.            

636
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,690
Now, it's so                    

637
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,892
{UIApplication.shared.delegate  
as!                             

638
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,027
Appdelegate).persistentContai-  
ner,                            

639
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:27,394
that's kind of                  
a messy line of code.           

640
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:30,330
There's a lot of, there's as    
and all these things in there.  

641
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,100
So at times we'll just          
create a static version of      

642
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:37,537
persistentContainer in          
our AppDelegate.                

643
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,138
Okay, we'll just call           
it the same thing.              

644
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,307
persistentContainer but         
it's static and                 

645
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,776
it's just gonna return          
that messy line of code.        

646
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:46,011
So now we can get that          
persistentContainer with        

647
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,747
AppDelegate.persistentContai-   
ner.                            

648
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,248
See what I did there?           

649
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:52,683
I just made it easier to get    
up by making that be a static,  

650
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:56,153
a class var, and we can do the  
same thing with viewContext,    

651
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:59,455
you might create a static       
called viewContext and for      

652
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:02,092
the rest of these slides you    
can assume I've done this.      

653
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,793
Which is good because typing    
that long messy thing would     

654
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:07,563
make all my slides              
spill over the edge.            

655
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,831
So I'm gonna use this           
shorter version as well.        

656
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,300
And you're welcome              
to create the static            

657
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,201
version in your                 
AppDelegate if you want         

658
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,568
to make your code               
a little cleaner.               

659
00:28:14,637 --> 00:28:17,104
Now this viewContext in         
the persistentContainer         

660
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:18,456
There's one of them that        
represents your entire          

661
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:19,740
are shared.                     

662
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:20,573
database.                       

663
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,709
So it's perfectly fine to       
create a single static          

664
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:23,643
that does this.                 

665
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:26,178
By the way, what if you         
wanted multiple databases?      

666
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,679
You could even have             
multiple databases with         

667
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,180
different schema.               

668
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,316
Very easy,                      
if you go look at the code for  

669
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:34,819
persistentContainer in          
AppDelegate,                    

670
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:37,087
you'll see it's only            
like four lines of code.        

671
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:39,289
And you could just copy         
it to create a different        

672
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:42,759
persistentContainer using       
a different xcmodeld file.      

673
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:45,295
Instead of using model          
according to the example,       

674
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:46,828
create another one with         
a different one and             

675
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:50,399
you can just go file, new file  
and create another data model.  

676
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:54,403
You could even create two       
persistent containers with      

677
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,904
the same model.                 

678
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,006
So they would be                
separate databases, but         

679
00:28:58,074 --> 00:28:59,640
have the same model,            
the same entities to that and   

680
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,674
the same relationship to that.  

681
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:02,309
It's perfectly                  
allowed as well.                

682
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:04,243
But for everything you're       
going to do in this class, and  

683
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:05,444
for really with most apps,      

684
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:08,046
you're going to have            
one big database.               

685
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,582
And you're going to have this   
one persistent container that   

686
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,384
is the container for it.        

687
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,452
All right.                      

688
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:18,055
So now I have a context in      
my hand, this viewContext.      

689
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,023
And what can I do?              

690
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,391
Well, of course, I can insert   
objects into the database.      

691
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,227
I can delete objects            
from the database.              

692
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,361
And I can query for             
objects in the database.        

693
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,662
So, let's talk about            
all those things.               

694
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,765
Let's start with insert         
because until we insert some    

695
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,267
data in the database we can't   
do any of those other things.   

696
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:35,136
And the way you insert          
an object in the database, or   

697
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,538
a way to do it,                 
and actually for                

698
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,107
the next few slide I'm going    
to kind of show you the,        

699
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,741
the essentials.                 

700
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,843
But, we're eventually going to  
move up to a high level and     

701
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,479
access this stuff in            
a much nicer way.               

702
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,414
But I'll tell you               
the basics of it first.         

703
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,117
So the basic way to put         
something in the database is    

704
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:53,252
with this really                
interesting method.             

705
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:57,923
NSEntityDescription.insertNew-  
Object(forEntityName: into:     

706
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,624
context).                       

707
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:02,260
Okay, that's a mouthful, used   
to be even more of a mouthful   

708
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,128
before they renamed it.         

709
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:08,366
And you just specify            
the name of the entity, so      

710
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:09,933
Tweet or TwitterUser.           

711
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:12,435
And you give it a context that  
is gonna be the viewContext     

712
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,570
you got from the AppDelegate.   

713
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,871
And boom, it's gonna create     
one of these in the database.   

714
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,708
Now all of its                  
attributes will be nil.         

715
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,810
Okay, although you can          
inspect the attributes in       

716
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:24,313
the data model editor and       
specify default value.          

717
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,848
And so it might start out       
with the default value.         

718
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:30,785
But if it doesn't,              
then they'll start out as nil.  

719
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:34,055
Okay, so that's great.          

720
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,323
I can now create one.           

721
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:40,460
And now I need to set those     
vars to have some value.        

722
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,496
I need to set the text of the   
tweet and things like that and  

723
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:46,465
I told you I'm gonna do         
this with value for key and     

724
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,867
set value for key.              

725
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:53,872
So for example I wanted to      
set the let's say the text,     

726
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:56,074
I could just say tweet.         

727
00:30:56,143 --> 00:31:00,212
A set value for key quote       
text, to be a string.           

728
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,117
And you can do dot notation     
here, with value for key path.  

729
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,318
That's what I'm showing         
in green right there.           

730
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:10,754
You can have, if you had        
a tweet you can actually set    

731
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:15,325
the tweet's tweeter's name,     
using this dot notation to set  

732
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,761
value for key path tweeter dot  
name and it would go through    

733
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,696
the tweeter relationship        
which is kinda fun.             

734
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:23,198
I'm kinda going fast through    
this because this is a really   

735
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,333
terrible API.                   

736
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:27,502
First of all it's               
got any in there so             

737
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,070
there's not type checking       
going on here, okay?            

738
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:37,311
You could say, set value date   
for key quote text, all right?  

739
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,480
And that would be perfectly     
accepted by Swift.              

740
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:43,617
Date is an Any and              
quote text is a String, but     

741
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:46,452
of course that's gonna fail     
miserably at run time, okay,    

742
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,087
because the text is a Atring.   

743
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,822
So we're not really gonna       
use this API but this is        

744
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:55,561
the underlying basic way that   
Core Data is doing this.        

745
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:57,695
Yes the key is just the name    
of the attribute, and           

746
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,732
the value is all the things     
we've talked about before.      

747
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,769
I do have the blue              
Use Scalar Type there which     

748
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:05,536
is interesting.                 

749
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:09,839
If the thing you're putting     
in the database is a flow or    

750
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,575
an Int32 or                     
one of these things.            

751
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:15,678
It's actually gonna be stored   
in a database as an NSNumber,   

752
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:16,879
which is a class,               

753
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:20,515
it's an object, kind of         
generic holder of numbers.      

754
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:25,320
But if you flip on the switch   
in the inspector in your data   

755
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,689
modeller for that attribute     
saying use a scalar type,       

756
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:32,360
then it'll make the type be     
double or int or whatever,      

757
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,394
instead of NSNumber, so.        

758
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,596
I know, you had a question?     

759
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,298
>> Yes, so the question is,     
does set value reject           

760
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:39,799
something where                 
the types don't match?          

761
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:41,434
And the answer is, it can't.    

762
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,702
It doesn't know the type,       
the types are any,              

763
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:46,138
as long as it matches any- and  
everything matches any.         

764
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:47,939
So, it can't.                   

765
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:52,577
There's no way for it to have   
enough information to reject.   

766
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:55,079
As long as it matches any,      
it'll accept that as the type.  

767
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,447
And then at runtime,            
it will crash.                  

768
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:59,216
If you try to set a date        
to be into a string field.      

769
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:03,553
>> So                           
when it's like [INAUDIBLE]      

770
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:06,856
save context,                   

771
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:09,125
do you have to like             
make it go through.             

772
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:10,293
Or is it.                       
>> Go and remove.               

773
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,660
>> [CROSSTALK]                  
>> What do you                  

774
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:12,794
mean go and remove it?          

775
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:13,428
Remove what?                    

776
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:23,604
Yeah, we'll talk                
about saving in this.           

777
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:24,638
So, the question is,            

778
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:26,773
when the app terminates         
it does save context and        

779
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:29,609
they're trying to save this,    
we'll talk all about saving in  

780
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,944
a minute cause that's           
an important piece of this.     

781
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:35,247
That's the keys and values,     
pretty straightforward there;   

782
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:38,150
in fact we're going to talk     
about saving right now.         

783
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:39,885
We do a nice lead in.           

784
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:43,020
All these changes that you      
make with that set value even   

785
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,123
insert entity description for   

786
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:48,125
entity name context whatever    
that thing is called.           

787
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,728
All that stuff only             
happens in memory,              

788
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,796
if you want that to actually    
happen permanently in           

789
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,998
the database you                
need to save it.                

790
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,233
And you do that by              
telling the context,            

791
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,370
like that view context thing,   
to save with the method save.   

792
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:04,240
It couldn't be simpler,         
except that it can throw.       

793
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,842
Save is a method that           
can throw because               

794
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,144
maybe there's a problem         
writing out to the database.    

795
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,880
And there's many problems       
that could happen writing       

796
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,448
out to the database.            

797
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:15,882
And you need to look            
at documentation and            

798
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,783
kind of figure out              
what they all are.              

799
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:20,687
But the take home message       
here is you do need to save.    

800
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,189
If you don't save, that         
substance is gonna be lost      

801
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:25,324
when your app exists or         
whatever.                       

802
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,558
So you definitely just save.    

803
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:29,627
And especially when talking     
about multithreaded Core Data.  

804
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:30,928
And one thread is working.      

805
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:33,531
That thread needs to save if    
it wants any of the other       

806
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,066
threads to see the work         
that it's done.                 

807
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:40,370
Okay, so you can use try        
question mark here, remember,   

808
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,604
which means try and             

809
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:44,807
if it fails,                    
just return nil and ignore it.  

810
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,310
You can do that, if you don't   
mind that it didn't save.       

811
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,946
And the kinda things that       
can happen, saving errors.      

812
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,248
You could obviously have        
file system problems,           

813
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:55,617
your disk is full or            
something like that.            

814
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:57,919
But you can also have           
inconsistencies in              

815
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:01,121
the database,                   
maybe you had conflicting       

816
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,291
data of two threads trying to   
save to the same database, and  

817
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,126
they've tried to write over     
the top of each other,          

818
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,261
those kind of things.           

819
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,496
Again, a lot of those problems  
you're not gonna have,          

820
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:12,365
unless you build                
a pretty complicated,           

821
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:14,733
multithreaded application,      
or something like that,         

822
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:17,335
but, again, you gotta check     
the documentation, I couldn't,  

823
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:19,971
it would take too long for      
me to go through all of it.     

824
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:25,776
Okay now, as I said value       
forKey and setValue forKey.     

825
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:29,713
Really ugly,                    

826
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:32,483
What we really want to do is    
be able to set these vars       

827
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,685
as vars, we just wanna          
have a var called text          

828
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,487
somewhere that we can set.      

829
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,521
And of course we're             
exactly going to do that.       

830
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,791
And the way we're going to do   
that is create a subclass of    

831
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,561
NSManagedObject, instead of     
having NSManagedObject in       

832
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:47,295
the database we doing           
set-value, get-value on it.     

833
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:51,465
Instead we're going to create   
a subclass of NSManageObjects   

834
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:54,635
and it's going to have vars on  
there for all the attributes,   

835
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:57,971
like text, and screen name and  
all those things.               

836
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,307
And Xcode will generate         
all that code for               

837
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,208
you behind the scenes,          

838
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:03,676
you don't have to do any        
work to make that happen.       

839
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,811
Quite quite simple, so let's    
look and see how we do that.    

840
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,280
You do that by                  
inspecting the entity.          

841
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:11,083
So here I've chosen tweet.      

842
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,316
Okay, not any of                
its attributes but              

843
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:15,786
tweet itself, and               
I want to make it so            

844
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:17,988
it generates this magic code,   
and how do I do that?           

845
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:20,857
Well, if you go down            
on the inspector                

846
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,260
a little ways you               
see it says Codegen.            

847
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:24,760
See that Codegen, that's for    

848
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,729
generating this code,           
this magic code.                

849
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:29,198
Now, you actually have          
a couple of choices here for    

850
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:30,299
the Codegen.                    

851
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,769
The default I believe is        
this one Class Definition.      

852
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,837
If you choose this one it will  
generate that subclass for      

853
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:38,873
you and it will just work.      

854
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:41,809
Okay, you'll be able to         
access your tweets as a class   

855
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:42,543
called tweet.                   

856
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,744
With all the vars.              

857
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:46,312
Now this sounds good and        

858
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,215
it is good; by the way if       
you do this class definition    

859
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:52,251
codegen it will not show        
up in your navigator.           

860
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,686
It's all behind the scenes-     
you never really see this file  

861
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:58,290
that is, this codegen           
file that generates.            

862
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:59,024
So don't look for               

863
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,792
it there if you put this        
on class definition.            

864
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:02,393
This might even be              
the default actually.           

865
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,028
To be Class Definition          
might be on.                    

866
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:07,030
But there's other               
choices in here.                

867
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,200
And the one we choose the most  
often is Category/Extension.    

868
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:15,271
By the way, category just       
is the Objective-C word for     

869
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:16,805
extension.                      

870
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:20,008
Objective-C has something like  
extensions called categories.   

871
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,809
So that's why it says           
Category/Extension.             

872
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:24,845
But you can think in your mind  
that this just says extension.  

873
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:28,215
And what this is gonna do is    
only generate an extension      

874
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:30,017
of your Tweet class.            

875
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:32,852
You have to actually write      
the Tweet class itself.         

876
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:35,121
But it's all gonna have         
only your code in it, or        

877
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,989
it could be empty if you want.  

878
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:40,325
The extension's gonna take      
care of all making the vars.    

879
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,061
Okay, the var                   
magic right there.              

880
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:47,165
So let's see how this works.    

881
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:48,933
Even when I switch to           
Category/Extension.             

882
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:51,268
Again, I don't get that         
extension showing up in         

883
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:52,035
my navigator.                   

884
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,838
It's kind of hidden from you.   

885
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:57,674
Here I'm gonna add the          
extension way of doing it for   

886
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,507
TwitterUser too.                

887
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,176
So both of them, both Tweet     
and TwitterUser, I'm gonna      

888
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:07,182
have an extension generated     
and, why do we like this one?   

889
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,917
Because, a lot of times for     

890
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,520
our Tweet or TwitterUser we     
want to add our own code.       

891
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:14,021
Like in a tweet.                

892
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:18,859
Imagine you wanted to add       
a static method that took data  

893
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:22,595
from Twitter and turned it      
into a tweet in the database.   

894
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:23,930
Where would you put that code?  

895
00:38:23,998 --> 00:38:26,498
Well, a great place to put it   
would be in a tweet class,      

896
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:27,699
if there was such a thing.      

897
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:30,502
And so, you're in fact,         
going to create such a thing.   

898
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,772
And the extension is going to   
handle all of the var business  

899
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:34,705
for you.                        

900
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:37,708
If you did choose Manual/None,  
right here for Codegen,         

901
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:40,544
meaning don't do any Codegen,   
then you're doing value for     

902
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:41,445
set value for key.              

903
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:45,682
Good luck with that, the        
code's gonna be a mess, okay?   

904
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,284
So, we almost always do it      
this way with this extension.   

905
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:52,721
Also, if we build our app       
using multiple modules          

906
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,523
like we have in Smash Tag,      
we have a framework module and  

907
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,158
then we have the main module.   

908
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:58,926
Then you're probably            
gonna wanna choose              

909
00:38:58,995 --> 00:39:01,228
from this pull-down here        
where it says module,           

910
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,230
current product module.         

911
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,467
I think if you have a single    
app that's not modularized      

912
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:10,470
like that you probably          
don't need to set that, but     

913
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,707
in a multi-modual app           
you probably do want to.        

914
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:18,577
So, since we've chosen here     
to create only the extension,   

915
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:22,080
we obviously need to write the  
code for the classes Tweet And  

916
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:25,017
TwitterUser, we have to create  
those classes ourselves.        

917
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,551
So how do we do that?           

918
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:28,419
Well, just like we              
create anything,                

919
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:30,220
we use file, new file.          

920
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:32,256
Then we do file, new file,      
this time we are back           

921
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:35,559
to saying it's a cocoa touch    
class because NSManageObject.   

922
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:37,660
Why is it code called           
cocoa touch class,              

923
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:40,229
we wanna make sure we set       
our super class to be in its    

924
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,030
managed object, right?          

925
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,665
So, I'm creating                
a class called Tweet,           

926
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:46,701
you see, which is a subclass    
of NSManagedObject.             

927
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,436
And is gonna create this for    
us.                             

928
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:51,539
See?                            
Class Tweet: NSManagedObject.   

929
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,706
No code in there.               

930
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:56,043
That space is for us,           
we get write anything we want.  

931
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:58,778
The code that does the vars     
is in that extension which we   

932
00:39:58,847 --> 00:39:59,746
don't even see, but but         

933
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,082
I'm gonna show it to            
yo in a second here.            

934
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:07,452
Notice that I picked            
the name of this class Tweet    

935
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:09,888
to be the same as the name of   
the entity in the database,     

936
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,290
which, you want to do.          

937
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,027
It is possible to not do that   
by inspecting the entity        

938
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,229
in the data model,              
but, don't do it.               

939
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:20,231
Just have the entity            
with the same name.             

940
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:22,699
People reading your code are    
going to expect this class,     

941
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:24,400
this subclass of                
NSManageObject that             

942
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:25,602
represents a tweet.             

943
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,371
Entity to be called tweet,      
so called it that.              

944
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:33,708
Now, we've got an error here,   
I'll just created this class,   

945
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:34,976
how I'm gonna possibly          
have an error,                  

946
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:36,944
I'm done anything how could     
I've done anything wrong?       

947
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,379
Well, the problem               
the problem here is,            

948
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:41,081
really, Xcode has               
done something wrong.           

949
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,685
When Xcode created this,        
it didn't seem to realize that  

950
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,687
NSManageObject is               
not in UIKit.                   

951
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:50,790
You see how it put              
import UIKit at the top?        

952
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:54,593
Really, what we need there      
is import CoreData, okay.       

953
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,761
All the code that you write,    

954
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,129
any time you're doing           
something in CoreData,          

955
00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:58,997
you have to import CoreData.    

956
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,032
It's a different framework      
that the UIKit so               

957
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:02,934
you must import it everywhere   
that you're going to use it.    

958
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,235
Just like we had to import      
Twitter everywhere we want to   

959
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:06,937
use that Twitter framework      
that I gave you.                

960
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,906
So, I don't know why Xcode,     
I think it's just an oversight  

961
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,306
Okay?                           

962
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,842
that Xcode when you             
choose NSManagedObject          

963
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:15,944
as your super class you should  
know, that's in Core Data so    

964
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:17,546
it should be import             
Core Data there.                

965
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:19,714
Don't know why it               
doesn't do that.                

966
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:22,784
So here I've created one for    
the TwitterUser class.          

967
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:25,352
Again you can put anything      
you want in there.              

968
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,219
This is your class.             

969
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:27,086
You can do anything you want.   

970
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:29,588
All the stuff about             
the vars is off in              

971
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,390
an extension somewhere.         

972
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:34,092
In fact, let's go take          
a look at that extension,       

973
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:34,910
Even though it's not going to   
show up in your next navigator  

974
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:35,660
what it looks like.             

975
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:37,127
you're probably never           
going to look at it.            

976
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:38,363
I thought I'd                   
show it to you so               

977
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,164
you understand a little         
bit what's going on.            

978
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:43,300
So, this is the extension,      
this generated for              

979
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:43,933
TwitterUser.                    

980
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,568
You see that is an extension    

981
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,236
of the TwitterUser class,       
right?                          

982
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:52,074
Remember extensions and         
it's got the vars.              

983
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,643
They're defined not just        
name and screenName but         

984
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,279
it's got that relationship      
var tweets as well.             

985
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:59,012
All right?                      

986
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,048
And look at                     
the type of tweets.             

987
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:03,917
As promised, it's an NSSet,     
it's an optional because it     

988
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:07,153
comes out of                    
the database as not set.        

989
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,221
It's gonna get set.             

990
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:11,022
So these are the vars.          

991
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:12,224
And I'll talk                   
a little bit about              

992
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:17,095
how these vars are actually     
implemented in a minute but     

993
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:18,463
all the vars are there.         

994
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:19,663
There's also some functions,    

995
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:20,964
now at the bottom you           
see those functions,            

996
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,967
those are kind of fun, those    
are convenience functions for   

997
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:28,438
adding and removing tweets      
from the tweets set             

998
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:33,876
because NSSet is immutable,     
okay?                           

999
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:36,913
It's not var verses             
let like swift things,          

1000
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:40,349
NS set is kind of old           
Objective-C way, and NSSet,     

1001
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:44,552
like NSAttributedString, is     
immutable, cannot be changed,   

1002
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,588
so how can I add any tweets     
to my database here?            

1003
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:50,158
Well you used these functions   
instead, add to tweets,         

1004
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,825
remove from tweets,             
add to tweets,                  

1005
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:55,896
remove from tweets, there's a   
pair for doing a single tweet,  

1006
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:58,531
and there having adding         
a whole bunch of tweets, or     

1007
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,833
removing a whole bunch          
of tweets, okay?                

1008
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:03,603
So you're definitely going      
to want those functions for     

1009
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,337
your assignment five.           

1010
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,540
Cuz you're gonna have some      
relationships where you're      

1011
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:11,609
gonna want to add them          
using these functions.          

1012
00:43:11,678 --> 00:43:12,643
Now it adds those               
functions for                   

1013
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:16,346
any too many relationship, any  
time you have a too many var    

1014
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:19,549
like tweets, it's going to add  
these functions automatically   

1015
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:21,151
It actually put it in its own   
little extension, this file     

1016
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:22,685
in the extensions.              

1017
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:26,622
has two extensions in it,       
both through TwitterUser.       

1018
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:29,825
Any questions about extensions  
there or any of that?           

1019
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:34,429
Okay, let's look at tweets      
extension real quick.           

1020
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:36,565
Couple other things to look     
at here that I didn't look      

1021
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:37,599
in the other one.               

1022
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:41,035
Notice this static func         
called fetchRequest?            

1023
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:41,735
Put that in your mind.          

1024
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:43,904
I'm gonna talk about            
that in a few slides.           

1025
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:46,640
fetchRequest is a really cool   
little static func that will    

1026
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:50,577
give you something you          
can use to fetch tweets.        

1027
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:52,245
And if you call fetchrRquest    
on twitter users,               

1028
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,213
you'll get something to         
fetch twitter users.            

1029
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:57,282
And we'll talk about all        
about fetch in a moment here.   

1030
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:01,886
Notice the type of tweeter,     
see the tweeter var.            

1031
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,589
Its type is TwitterUser.        

1032
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:06,324
Because of course that's        
what the tweeter is,            

1033
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,494
we control drag between the     
tweet and the tweeter user so   

1034
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:11,929
that tweeter var is of          
course a tweeter user,          

1035
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:15,432
not an NSSet, because it's      
a two one relationship, okay,   

1036
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,301
there's only one TwitterUser,   
who is my tweeter.              

1037
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:23,138
And what about                  
this @NSManaged?                

1038
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:27,009
Okay, @NSManaged I'm just       
gonna say it's magic.           

1039
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:28,210
It's not really magic.          

1040
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:33,181
It's essentially something      
that says to the runtime, hey.  

1041
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,083
When someone                    
accesses this var,              

1042
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,485
Core Data's gonna               
figure it out for you.          

1043
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:40,053
And what Core Data does,        
is when you try to say          

1044
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:45,058
Tweet.created equals some       
date, it gets trapped           

1045
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:48,228
at a low level in the runtime   
and Core Data swoops in and     

1046
00:44:48,297 --> 00:44:51,731
does set value for              
key for you, okay.              

1047
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:55,268
Same thing if you get the       
created var, it swoops in and   

1048
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:57,603
does value for key and          
gets it that way.               

1049
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:01,339
But it's all happening at       
a low level behind the scenes.  

1050
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:05,309
So this extension does satisfy  
the extension limitation where  

1051
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,544
it can't have any storage.      

1052
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:09,580
All of the storage for these    
vars isn't in the database.     

1053
00:45:10,616 --> 00:45:12,416
And when you ask for it.        

1054
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:14,985
Or when you set it,             
it's using its value for        

1055
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,019
key instead of value for key,   
to set it in the database.      

1056
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:18,087
Now again, it sets in memory.   

1057
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:19,021
You have to save it for         

1058
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,955
it to actually go out           
into the database.              

1059
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:25,159
But that what's happening.      

1060
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:29,130
All right, so                   

1061
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,334
now that we have these          
class so here's some            

1062
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:39,206
code that creates a tweets and  
sets it's attributes, okay so   

1063
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,875
let's look at this piece by     
piece and see what it does.     

1064
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:45,078
The first thing is to create    
a tweet, we don't have to do    

1065
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:49,449
NSEntityDescription, Entity,    
insert Entity for name into     

1066
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:52,318
contacts, or whatever that      
huge, long terrible thing was-  

1067
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:55,421
we can just say, tweet,         
parenthesis context.            

1068
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,223
You just say what context,      
which means what database you   

1069
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:00,859
want the tweet to put in and    
it creates a new tweet.         

1070
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:03,994
Okay, just use a normal         
initializer for                 

1071
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:05,496
new things so                   
that's super cool.              

1072
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,364
That's one of the coolest       
features right there.           

1073
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,666
Not having to use an            
NSEntityDescription thing, so   

1074
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:13,002
no more NSEntityDescription,    
we'll not have to do that.      

1075
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:13,769
And then here,                  

1076
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,107
I'm setting the text to be      
140 characters of pure joy.     

1077
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,176
And I don't have to say set     
value 140 characters of pure    

1078
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:24,646
joy for key text and have all   
these literal strings like      

1079
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:28,016
text in there in                
this untyped thing.             

1080
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:29,918
I just say tweet.text           
equals that.                    

1081
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:33,620
And the same thing here with    
created, again, so we don't     

1082
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:36,857
even have to worry about        
the thing, if we tried to say   

1083
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:41,228
tweet.created equals quote      
hello, this Swift would say,    

1084
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:44,330
no, created is of type Date,    
so you can't do that, so        

1085
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:46,899
it finds all of our,            
it type checks everything,      

1086
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:49,801
finds all of our                
possible errors.                

1087
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,170
What about relationships,       
okay, setting relationships?    

1088
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,675
So here I've created another    
object, a TwitterUser and       

1089
00:46:56,743 --> 00:46:59,144
again I just set                
TwitterUser with a context,     

1090
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,111
I'll talk about that argument   
in just a second but            

1091
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,050
I told what database I wanna    
create in TwitterUser and       

1092
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:10,588
I set my tweet's tweeter        
equal to that TwitterUser.      

1093
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:12,522
So, it's exactly what you're,   
would imagine right?            

1094
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:14,290
Just set it equal to Joe.       

1095
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:18,794
And what's interesting about    
this is that when you set one   

1096
00:47:18,863 --> 00:47:22,865
side of a relationship,         
the other side gets updated     

1097
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:26,001
automatically, 100%             
of the time.                    

1098
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,369
This is call maintaining        

1099
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:30,038
the integrity of the database,  
okay?                           

1100
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:33,341
And Core Data always            
maintains database integrity.   

1101
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,543
So, when you change             
one side relationship.          

1102
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:36,710
It changes the other.           

1103
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:39,546
So, that means for              
example if I say tweet.tweeter  

1104
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:42,282
equals Joe, then if I went      
over to the Joe side and        

1105
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:46,152
said hey give me Joe's tweets   
and I'm even gonna turn it      

1106
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,855
into a Swift kind of set        
from an NSSet to a set of       

1107
00:47:49,924 --> 00:47:52,291
tweet because we know that's    
what tweets are, right?         

1108
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,461
Tweets are a set of Tweets, so  
I'm gonna as it to do that.     

1109
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,365
Then I can say, if Joe's tweet  
contains that tweet print yes   

1110
00:48:00,434 --> 00:48:02,533
and of course it is             
going to print yes.             

1111
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:05,002
Because when I said             
tweet.tweeter = joe,            

1112
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:07,538
it automatically got            
added to joe's tweets.          

1113
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:09,238
That make sense?                

1114
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:10,640
And same thing the other way.   

1115
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,375
If I added a tweet              
into joe's tweets,              

1116
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:16,112
that tweet tweeter would        
automatically set to be joe.    

1117
00:48:17,614 --> 00:48:18,546
Okay?                           
Both sides will always          

1118
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:19,614
point to each other.            

1119
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:21,482
You never have to do anything   
to make that happen.            

1120
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:27,688
tweet.tweeter=joe is exactly    

1121
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:30,623
the same as saying joe          
dot addToTweets tweet.          

1122
00:48:30,692 --> 00:48:32,959
Remember addToTweets is one of  
those convenience functions     

1123
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,427
that it created for             
us over there.                  

1124
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:37,529
Now, notice                     
the argument I used for         

1125
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:40,398
the context to create           
the Twitter user there.         

1126
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:43,434
I didn't say                    
AppDelegate.viewContext.        

1127
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,502
I didn't use that same          
context bar that I had.         

1128
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:47,537
I said                          
tweet.manageObjectContext.      

1129
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:51,107
In other words, I got, I found  
out what database the tweet is  

1130
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:53,977
in, and I put the Twitter       
user in the same database.      

1131
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,212
And this is a common way        
of programming in Core Data     

1132
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:59,148
where when you wanna            
get a context and               

1133
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:01,717
you already have a object       
in the database you             

1134
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:04,786
ask the object you already      
have what context to use.       

1135
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:08,256
And you can see that if I ever  
change my code to not put this  

1136
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:12,059
into this context, to put it    
into another context, at least  

1137
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:14,695
the Twitter user and the tweet  
would always be together        

1138
00:49:14,764 --> 00:49:16,330
in whatever that context is.    

1139
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:18,865
So you can see why I            
used the tweets can't           

1140
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:22,702
manage object context here to   
create that instead of using    

1141
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:24,170
the context again.              

1142
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:26,905
So, it, it would work to        
say context, of course,         

1143
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:30,575
but I'm just saying there's a   
paradigm of development where   

1144
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:33,612
we're gonna try and use         
the context of related object.  

1145
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,480
So they end up in the same      
database for sure.              

1146
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:37,715
Okay?                           

1147
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:41,351
All right, so                   

1148
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,821
we can also use dot notation,   
because these are just vars.    

1149
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,723
So when I say tweet.tweeter,    
I get a TwitterUser object.     

1150
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:50,059
So, of course,                  
I can say dot name on it and    

1151
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:52,228
set it equal to Joe Schmo,      
whatever, right?                

1152
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:57,266
tweet.tweeter.name =            
"Joe Schmo", all right?         

1153
00:49:57,334 --> 00:49:59,134
No restriction there            
on those vars.                  

1154
00:50:00,703 --> 00:50:03,337
All right, remember I told      
you about the scalars?          

1155
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:06,240
This is that switch I was       
telling you about before.       

1156
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:09,777
If you don't do this,           
then when you say,              

1157
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:13,313
if you had an int,              
let's say you had retweet       

1158
00:50:13,382 --> 00:50:17,950
count which was an int          
here let's say on Int32.        

1159
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,185
If you don't switch             
this button,                    

1160
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:22,188
then that's going to be         
an NSNumber not an Int32.       

1161
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,489
But when you click              
this switch on,                 

1162
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:26,958
now that var will               
be of type Int32.               

1163
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:28,893
So you almost always            
want this for numbers.          

1164
00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:32,296
99.9% of the time, you want     
to have this switch on.         

1165
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:33,964
Luckily, it's on by default so  

1166
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,065
you don't even have to          
think about it much, but        

1167
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,300
I just wanted to let            
you know about it.              

1168
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:40,970
All right, so                   
now lets talk about deletion.   

1169
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,773
Okay, now, I want to delete     
something from the database.    

1170
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,641
And that's incredibly easy,     

1171
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,378
almost too easy because your    
data's precious you don't want  

1172
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,547
to be deleting it to easily,    
but you do that by asking       

1173
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:56,851
the context to delete the       
NSManagedObject, so you can     

1174
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:59,920
pass any NSManagedObject        
to this method delete and       

1175
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:02,189
it will delete it               
from the database.              

1176
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:05,325
And it could cascade and        
delete other things as well     

1177
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:08,161
depending on what delete        
rule is, all right?             

1178
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,530
Most of the time by default,    
when I delete something,        

1179
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,067
other things that point to it   
get that pointer set to nil.    

1180
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:18,036
That's the nullify              
delete rule.                    

1181
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:20,038
Now, when things get deleted    
from the database they got      

1182
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:23,541
sent this message first,        
prepare for deletion.           

1183
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,177
Okay, and                       
this is a really good method.   

1184
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:28,812
Again, in here you don't        
have to do anything             

1185
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,748
to worry about the other        
pointers point to you           

1186
00:51:31,817 --> 00:51:33,583
that's all fixed by             
the delete rule.                

1187
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:36,919
But what if you had another     
field in your database?         

1188
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:39,421
Back to the retweet             
count example again.            

1189
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,592
Let's say I had an int          
somewhere in TwitterUser,       

1190
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:46,227
which counted                   
the number of retweets          

1191
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:48,296
that this twitter               
user had done.                  

1192
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:51,065
And so if I was deleting        
a tweet and it happened to be   

1193
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:54,902
a retweet then I need to set    
that to be minus equal one.     

1194
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:56,636
And here's the perfect          
place to do it.                 

1195
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,372
So tweet, and                   
it's prepared for               

1196
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,507
deletion saying whoop,          
I'm about to be deleted.        

1197
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,376
I'd better tell my Twitter      
user, cuz I'm a retweet,        

1198
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:07,013
that he needs to decrement      
his retweet count.              

1199
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:09,381
So you see why you would        
use prepare for deletion?       

1200
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:11,416
It's a way to kind of update    
other things in the database    

1201
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:14,252
when as you're                  
leaving the database.           

1202
00:52:15,855 --> 00:52:17,955
All right, so                   
that's it for deletion.         

1203
00:52:18,023 --> 00:52:19,789
Next topic, querying,           

1204
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:22,158
the most important piece of     
this whole database thing.      

1205
00:52:22,227 --> 00:52:24,294
It's really a waste of time     
doing all this stuff if you're  

1206
00:52:24,362 --> 00:52:24,961
not gonna query, okay?          

1207
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:28,831
If you're not gonna make        
sophisticated requests for      

1208
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,767
the information based on        
the relationships, etc.         

1209
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:36,238
So, to do a query the most      
important thing you need to     

1210
00:52:36,306 --> 00:52:40,475
know is NSFetchRequest,         
this class NSFetchRequest.      

1211
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:43,077
And NSFetchRequest              
encapsulates                    

1212
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:45,946
what you want from              
the database.                   

1213
00:52:46,015 --> 00:52:47,915
So let's talk about             
an NSFetchRequest and           

1214
00:52:47,984 --> 00:52:51,351
how we build one.               

1215
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,552
So when we're building one,     

1216
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:54,487
there's three important         
things we need to know.         

1217
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:57,323
One, what entity                
are we fetching?                

1218
00:52:57,391 --> 00:53:01,626
Because a FetchRequest can      
only Fetch one kind of entity.  

1219
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,962
You can, there's no such thing  
a FetchRequest that will give   

1220
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,565
you some tweet and              
some Twitter user.              

1221
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:07,464
No, okay?                       

1222
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:09,700
A fetch always gives            
you all tweets or               

1223
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,136
all Twitter users, make sense?  

1224
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:13,070
So that's the number            
one thing,                      

1225
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:14,905
is we're gonna create           
the fetch request.              

1226
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:17,606
And it will be a fetch request  
or a very specific entity.      

1227
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:20,576
And it will only be able        
to fetch those entities.        

1228
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:24,446
The second thing is is          
an array of sort descriptors.   

1229
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:25,647
And why do we want this?        

1230
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:29,017
Because when we execute this    
fetch it's gonna come back      

1231
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:31,151
as an array, okay?              

1232
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,753
All the matching tweets or      

1233
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:34,888
Twitter user will come          
back in an array.               

1234
00:53:34,957 --> 00:53:35,922
And since it's an array,        

1235
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:39,693
arrays are not sets,            
arrays are ordered and so       

1236
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:42,361
we have specify what order      
the things are in the arrays.   

1237
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,830
So we do that with              
these sort descriptors.         

1238
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:47,833
And finally, we just specify    
or what is it that we want,     

1239
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:51,236
which tweets do we want, which  
Twitter users do we want and    

1240
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:53,971
we do that with something       
called a predicate.             

1241
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,039
Okay, so let's dive in and      

1242
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,174
look at all three               
of these things.                

1243
00:53:57,243 --> 00:53:58,575
This is what it looks like,     

1244
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,777
kinda top level to              
create a fetch request.         

1245
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,479
Okay, you get a fetch request.  

1246
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,447
You set the source descriptor   
and you set its predicate.      

1247
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:07,016
So you get each of              
these three parts.              

1248
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:08,650
So getting the fetch            
request is easy.                

1249
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:10,852
We're gonna use that            
little static function          

1250
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:14,455
that the extension that         
I talked about, made for        

1251
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:16,223
us called fetchRequest.         

1252
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:19,127
Now, this is one of the very    
few times when Swift            

1253
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:22,830
cannot infer the type           
of this return value.           

1254
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,500
Should've put this in red,      
okay?                           

1255
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:27,133
Because it's so                 

1256
00:54:27,202 --> 00:54:29,568
rare, Swift can almost          
always infer things.            

1257
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:31,169
But in turns out                
NSManagedObject                 

1258
00:54:31,238 --> 00:54:34,506
has a fetchRequest method and   
it returns the more generic     

1259
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:37,108
kind of fetchRequest and        
so when you're getting it,      

1260
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:39,610
it doesn't quite know           
which one you want.             

1261
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,579
So when you ask a Tweet for     

1262
00:54:41,648 --> 00:54:44,582
its fetch request right here,   
you have to tell it did you     

1263
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,318
want the one in Tweet not       
the one from its super class?   

1264
00:54:48,387 --> 00:54:48,884
All right?                      
And so                          

1265
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,186
say let request equal           
NSFetchRequest.                 

1266
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,756
It's a generic type like array  
or something like that, right?  

1267
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:55,958
This is a fetch request         
only for Tweets.                

1268
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,594
So you say                      
NSFetchRequest<tweet> =         

1269
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,595
Tweet.fetchRequest().           

1270
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,396
And it knows, of course,        

1271
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,900
that the only one that          
returns an NSFetchRequest for   

1272
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:09,003
tweets is the fetchRequest,     
and that's Tweet extension.     

1273
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:12,439
So now,                         
you have a fetchRequest,        

1274
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:14,741
this is how you get a fetch     
request- couldn't be easier.    

1275
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:17,442
You just have to remember       
to do that static               

1276
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:19,378
typing right there.             

1277
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:21,446
Okay, now we need               
the sortDescriptor, right?      

1278
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:22,947
It's got this                   
array coming back.              

1279
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:25,516
What order are they             
going to be?                    

1280
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:27,851
SortDescriptor looks            
like this.                      

1281
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,352
You create it with a key.       

1282
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:32,188
That is the key,                
the attribute in                

1283
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:35,258
the database that you want to   
sort on, so the screen name or  

1284
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:38,828
even the text in the tweet or   
the actual name of              

1285
00:55:38,897 --> 00:55:40,896
the tweeter,                    
whatever it's gonna be.         

1286
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,230
This right here,                
sortDescriptor,                 

1287
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:45,867
will be a sort descriptor only  
suitable for fetching Twitter   

1288
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:49,471
users, because screenName       
is a key in Twitter user,       

1289
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,906
not in tweet, so we're gonna    
use this SortDescriptor         

1290
00:55:51,975 --> 00:55:53,641
in a tweet request.             

1291
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:55,175
And I say that because          
on the previous slide,          

1292
00:55:55,244 --> 00:55:57,611
I just showed you how to make   
a fetch request for a tweet.    

1293
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,312
Anyway, I should just, that     
should have been Twitter user.  

1294
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,648
But anyway, so                  
this is a Twitter user.         

1295
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:02,781
SortDescriptor.                 

1296
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,951
And notice it has ascending or  
descending like us A to Z or    

1297
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,588
Z to A and then it has          
this argument selector and      

1298
00:56:10,657 --> 00:56:13,458
this one creates                
some confusion.                 

1299
00:56:13,527 --> 00:56:15,859
But really this                 
selector just says,             

1300
00:56:15,928 --> 00:56:20,497
what method am I gonna use to   
compare items to do the sort.   

1301
00:56:20,566 --> 00:56:24,735
All right now, you don't even   
have to specify the selector    

1302
00:56:24,804 --> 00:56:26,837
if you don't want to and for    

1303
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:29,906
almost all data types,          
numbers,                        

1304
00:56:29,975 --> 00:56:34,410
dates, it's going to use        
a method called compare, okay.  

1305
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:38,747
Compare returns something       
called a comparison result      

1306
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:41,450
which is either, it's the       
same, it's greater than, or     

1307
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:42,084
it's less than.                 

1308
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:43,618
So, that's what this            
compare method does.            

1309
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:44,885
And it's implemented by date.   

1310
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:46,187
It's implemented by Int32.      

1311
00:56:46,256 --> 00:56:47,888
It's implemented by double.     

1312
00:56:47,957 --> 00:56:49,823
It's even implemented           
by string.                      

1313
00:56:49,892 --> 00:56:50,724
Okay?                           
So,                             

1314
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:52,358
you could just use compare.     

1315
00:56:52,427 --> 00:56:54,594
But, for strings.               

1316
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,695
You wanna think a little        
bit about what kind             

1317
00:56:56,764 --> 00:56:57,895
of comparison do you want?      

1318
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:01,233
Do you want                     
case-insensitive compare?       

1319
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:03,734
Or you could even use           
this special compare,           

1320
00:57:03,803 --> 00:57:05,736
called                          
localizedStandardCompare.       

1321
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:06,737
This will compare them so       

1322
00:57:06,806 --> 00:57:09,573
that it is sourced just         
like the finder on the Mac.     

1323
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:11,575
And what does the finder on     
the Mac do that's different     

1324
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:12,942
than case insensitive?          

1325
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,444
Well, there's a lot of issues   
with things like diacritic      

1326
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:17,912
marks, and you know,            

1327
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:20,616
things in your local language   
where things sort differently,  

1328
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:23,284
depending on what language      
you're in, what locale it is.   

1329
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:25,419
You'd, you sometimes you        
ignore the diacritics,          

1330
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:26,320
like accent marks.              

1331
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:28,154
Sometimes they mean something.  

1332
00:57:28,223 --> 00:57:31,992
And, so localized standard      
compare is a special compare    

1333
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:35,194
for strings, that knows         
how to do that, okay?           

1334
00:57:35,263 --> 00:57:38,197
And this is very commonly the   
one we will use for strings.    

1335
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:39,832
When we're gonna show           
something in our UI,            

1336
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:42,334
maybe this array of thing for   
fetching,                       

1337
00:57:42,403 --> 00:57:43,168
we're gonna put it in the UI.   

1338
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:44,769
We would want it                
to be in order,                 

1339
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,304
this localizedStandardCompare.  

1340
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:50,374
You notice that it's            
an NSString dot method.         

1341
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:53,343
It's not                        
String.localizedStandardComp-   

1342
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:55,679
that's because this has to be   
an Objective-C visible method.  

1343
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,947
are.                            
And                             

1344
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,584
And you need                    
the NSString version.           

1345
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,285
So basically you're going       
to say NSString dot, and        

1346
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:07,522
you can go look, search for     
compare in NSString or string,  

1347
00:58:07,591 --> 00:58:09,690
because a string implements     
them all as well but            

1348
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:12,393
you need NSString dot and       
then the name of the method.    

1349
00:58:12,462 --> 00:58:14,995
And you can search, and         
there is case insensitive and   

1350
00:58:15,064 --> 00:58:18,232
the standard compare and then   
the regular compare and etc.    

1351
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:22,335
Now one other thing             
about this is that,             

1352
00:58:22,404 --> 00:58:27,273
these methods some of           
them are special in that,       

1353
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:32,211
it does to compare on           
the database side, okay.        

1354
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,082
Using SQL to do it,             
see what I'm saying?            

1355
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,251
It's not actually bringing      
all the data over.              

1356
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,786
Calling this method             
on every string, and            

1357
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,989
doing some kind of              
quicksort or something.         

1358
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:46,690
It's using super powerful       
sorting mechanisms that         

1359
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,993
are built into an SQL           
database, okay.                 

1360
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:52,896
So, in fact, all of the         
NSString ones will do that.     

1361
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:56,834
Okay, so                        
they're super duper efficient.  

1362
00:58:56,902 --> 00:59:00,537
Now, if you wanted to use       
your own compare though,        

1363
00:59:00,606 --> 00:59:01,971
it's not gonna be efficient.    

1364
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,838
Because it is gonna have to     

1365
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,674
bring all the data from the     
database into your memory so    

1366
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:07,509
it can run your little          
method over it.                 

1367
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:08,776
So I strongly recommend         

1368
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,479
against using your              
own selector here.              

1369
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,413
I would use                     
the standard selectors.         

1370
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:14,548
If you're gonna use             
your own selector               

1371
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,449
it's gotta be on                
a pretty small dataset.         

1372
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:20,487
Cuz it's not gonna              
be very efficient.              

1373
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:24,423
Notice that when we             
do the fetch request,           

1374
00:59:24,492 --> 00:59:26,759
we don't just give it           
a sort descriptor,              

1375
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,427
we give it an array             
of sort descriptors.            

1376
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:33,632
That's the old sort by last     
name, and then first name.      

1377
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,432
Right?                          
So if                           

1378
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:37,167
we have 12 Smiths in there,     
we'll sort them and             

1379
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:38,936
the Smiths will be              
in the right spot.              

1380
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:40,870
And then all of the first       
names of the Smiths             

1381
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:41,971
will be in order by that.       

1382
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,240
So we can have as many of       
these sub sort by the one       

1383
00:59:44,308 --> 00:59:45,675
thing, sub sort by              
the next thing,                 

1384
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:47,476
sub sort by the next thing.     

1385
00:59:47,544 --> 00:59:50,612
Basically, we can break ties    
with subsequent sorting and     

1386
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:53,749
that's why we give an array     
of sort descriptors.            

1387
00:59:56,619 --> 01:00:00,688
Okay, so,                       
that's the fetch request and    

1388
01:00:00,757 --> 01:00:02,790
its sort descriptors and        
now the predicate.              

1389
01:00:02,858 --> 01:00:06,192
Okay, the predicate is the      
guts of saying which tweets do  

1390
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:06,993
we want.                        

1391
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,962
Which Twitter                   
users do we want?               

1392
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,031
We create them with kind        
of interesting API.             

1393
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:17,069
It looks a lot like             
printf from C.                  

1394
01:00:17,137 --> 01:00:20,672
NSPredicate format colon,       
and then a string.              

1395
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,008
And the string is               
a format string.                

1396
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:24,608
And again,                      
looks a lot like printf.        

1397
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:28,045
So the best way to explain      
this is probably by example.    

1398
01:00:28,114 --> 01:00:30,114
But the way you're gonna        
learn this is you're gonna go   

1399
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:33,884
read the documentation for      
NSPredicate, you've got to go   

1400
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:37,053
read that documentation,        
in its class documentation,     

1401
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:39,856
there's gonna be a link that    
says, creating predicates,      

1402
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:42,858
or something like that, click   
on that, and go there, and      

1403
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:45,327
learn all the things you can    
put in this format string,      

1404
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:48,497
cuz it's all very specific to   
doing database queries, but     

1405
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:49,631
I'll show you some examples,    
so                              

1406
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,666
you get an idea of              
what's going on here.           

1407
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,067
So here's the first one,        

1408
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:54,935
let's have the search           
string called foo.              

1409
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:00,039
All these searches then         
I'm gonna do right here         

1410
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:01,307
are tweet searches.             

1411
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:04,710
These are for predicates for    
searching for a tweet.          

1412
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:08,113
So first, I'm gonna find        
all the tweets whose text,      

1413
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:11,617
the actual tweet, the 140       
characters of pure joy or       

1414
01:01:11,685 --> 01:01:14,151
whatever, contains              
case sensitive.                 

1415
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,320
Case insensitively.             

1416
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:18,222
That's what [c] means.          

1417
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,624
%@.                             
%@ is a substitution variable,  

1418
01:01:20,693 --> 01:01:22,659
and I have to give              
its value at the end.           

1419
01:01:22,728 --> 01:01:25,328
And so I'm substituting         
search string.                  

1420
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:28,298
Okay, note that I can't say,    
text contains foo.              

1421
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:32,902
I have to say,                  
text contains %@ and then.      

1422
01:01:32,971 --> 01:01:35,037
Put something at                
the end there.                  

1423
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:36,237
Okay, so                        
that's an obvious one,          

1424
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:38,739
I'm searching for all my        
tweets that contain foo.        

1425
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:41,309
How about this one?             

1426
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:46,213
I want all the tweets           
whose tweeter equals %@.        

1427
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:48,615
I'm going to put Joe in there   
as the substitution variable    

1428
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:52,986
and created after some          
date that I create.             

1429
01:01:54,155 --> 01:01:56,489
See that?                       
I'm using greater               

1430
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:57,556
than to do that.                

1431
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:59,324
And I'm doing && for and,       

1432
01:01:59,393 --> 01:02:01,326
you can also use the word and   
there.                          

1433
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:03,094
Okay?                           
So that's all gonna be          

1434
01:02:03,163 --> 01:02:05,129
the tweets created by           
Joe since that date.            

1435
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,198
You're starting to see the      
power of building the query     

1436
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,133
into the database, right?       

1437
01:02:10,202 --> 01:02:12,601
If I had thousands of tweets,   
it'd be really easy to find     

1438
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:14,570
the ones since yesterday,       
for example.                    

1439
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:16,839
I'll show you that              
in a second here.               

1440
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:21,910
Aand then I can also though,    
search through dot notation,    

1441
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:23,844
on other fields,                
in other entities, but          

1442
01:02:23,913 --> 01:02:28,616
this tweeter.screenName equals  
percent @ sign%@ with CS193P,   

1443
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:30,617
that's still searching for      
tweets.                         

1444
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:31,185
That's searching for            

1445
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:34,621
tweets whose tweeter's          
screen name is CS193P.          

1446
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:37,056
Do you see what                 
it's doing there?               

1447
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,557
This is still                   
a tweet predicate.              

1448
01:02:38,626 --> 01:02:41,060
This is not a twitter           
user predicate.                 

1449
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:43,094
Okay?                           

1450
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:45,263
So here's a different           
predicate.                      

1451
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:47,932
This one is for Twitter user.   

1452
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:49,234
So here I'm searching for       
all the Twitter users           

1453
01:02:49,235 --> 01:02:50,468
Okay?                           

1454
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:56,506
who has a Tweet whose           
text contains foo.              

1455
01:02:57,743 --> 01:02:58,708
Okay?                           

1456
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:01,009
So it even knows how            
to do a pluralistic             

1457
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:03,278
search right here where you've  
got tweets dot text that means  

1458
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:08,049
all the tweets, texts and       
doing contains and              

1459
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,919
we can do [c] if                
we wanted foo.                  

1460
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,054
So that's a twitter user        
search right there.             

1461
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,555
the twitter users who have      
tweeted anything that includes  

1462
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:15,989
We're looking for               

1463
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,493
foo, again a powerful search,   
really easy to express.         

1464
01:03:22,563 --> 01:03:24,197
Question.                       

1465
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:27,733
>> [INAUDIBLE]                  
>> So the question,             

1466
01:03:27,801 --> 01:03:29,801
does it infer this from         
the name of the variable,       

1467
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:31,035
it's not inferring it,          

1468
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:34,172
it's actually using the name    
of the attribute tweets         

1469
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,674
right there and the name of     
the attribute text and it's     

1470
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:40,177
building a SQL statement that   
will go and do this fetch.      

1471
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,878
Okay now it's doing all         
that underneath the covers,     

1472
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:44,314
we don't care how,              
but it's doing it.              

1473
01:03:47,952 --> 01:03:48,718
Yeah, compound predicate.       

1474
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,453
You can build a compound        
predicate like an and           

1475
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:52,887
predicate or an or predicate.   

1476
01:03:52,956 --> 01:03:55,957
You could put or or             
and in the string, or           

1477
01:03:56,025 --> 01:03:58,026
you could create separate       
predicates and and              

1478
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:00,794
them together by creating       
an NSCompoundPredicate.         

1479
01:04:00,863 --> 01:04:02,195
And predicate with              
sub-predicates, and             

1480
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:03,864
just given an array             
of predicates and               

1481
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:04,664
it ands them together.          

1482
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:06,699
Why would you ever want to do   
this versus just putting and    

1483
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:07,600
or, or in there?                

1484
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:10,970
Well, maybe you're computing    
what the predicates are,        

1485
01:04:11,038 --> 01:04:14,139
based on some, depending on     
what the user clicked on or     

1486
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:14,939
something, you're               
computing it, and               

1487
01:04:15,008 --> 01:04:18,009
so you want to add these        
things you computed together.   

1488
01:04:19,845 --> 01:04:22,980
All right, there's also         
function predicates.            

1489
01:04:23,049 --> 01:04:25,382
Now these are super             
powerful predicates,            

1490
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:27,284
and you don't need these for    
your homework, so               

1491
01:04:27,352 --> 01:04:30,120
don't worry too much about      
these, but they're cool.        

1492
01:04:30,188 --> 01:04:32,621
You can even say, you have      
a search like this one,         

1493
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:35,291
tweets.@count > 5,              

1494
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,926
this is a Twitter user search,  
that finds                      

1495
01:04:37,994 --> 01:04:42,363
all the Twitter users who have  
more than 5 Tweets, okay?       

1496
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:45,266
So, @count is actually          
running, kind of a function in  

1497
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:49,003
the database, to go count       
the number of Tweets that       

1498
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:50,770
the Twitter user has.           

1499
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:52,639
So, again, you'll see all       
of this when you go look at     

1500
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:55,708
the NSPredicate documentation,  
it's incredibly powerful,       

1501
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:59,445
you can see you barely have to  
type anything in as the format  

1502
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:02,081
string, and you get these       
really powerful searches.       

1503
01:05:04,218 --> 01:05:06,718
All right, so let's put it      
all together now to create      

1504
01:05:06,787 --> 01:05:08,019
our fetch request, okay.        

1505
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:09,154
I'm gonna create,               

1506
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:11,189
in this case,                   
a Twitter user fetch request.   

1507
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:13,857
So I'm saying                   
a FetchRequest<TwitterUser> =   

1508
01:05:13,926 --> 01:05:16,527
TwitterUser.fetchRequest(),     
then I'm gonna                  

1509
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:18,161
create a time which             
was yesterday,                  

1510
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,030
it's actually not,              
it's 24 hours ago.              

1511
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:24,133
Time interval since now,        
minus 24 times 60 times 60,     

1512
01:05:24,202 --> 01:05:27,068
that's 24 hours ago, and        
I'm creating a predicate        

1513
01:05:27,137 --> 01:05:31,239
that says, find me any Twitter  
users that have a Tweet that's  

1514
01:05:31,308 --> 01:05:36,378
created before yesterday,       
or since yesterday I guess,     

1515
01:05:36,447 --> 01:05:38,812
yes, created is greater         
than yesterday.                 

1516
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:42,917
So I'm finding all the Twitter  
users who have created Tweets   

1517
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,419
in the last twenty-four hours,  
that's what this one does.      

1518
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:49,556
So any is a special term        
that means match any            

1519
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,424
of these things, and            

1520
01:05:51,492 --> 01:05:54,828
these things are Tweets that    
are created since yesterday.    

1521
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:58,831
And I'm gonna sort the result   
by the actual name,             

1522
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:01,733
the real name of                
the Twitter user.               

1523
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:04,436
So I'm just doing               
sortDescriptor, key of name,    

1524
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:07,305
ascending true, I'm not         
specifying a selector, so       

1525
01:06:07,374 --> 01:06:09,873
I'm gonna get kind of           
the default comparison.         

1526
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:12,743
Okay, that's it, so that's how  
you create a fetch request.     

1527
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:16,914
Now, since I have a fetch       
request, how do I make it go?   

1528
01:06:16,982 --> 01:06:19,782
Give me those Tweets,           
give me those Twitter users.    

1529
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,618
We do that with the very        
simple method in context, so    

1530
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,721
we ask the context to do the    
fetch, and it will go out and   

1531
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:28,623
return an array of              
all those things,               

1532
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:31,627
sorted in the way the fetch     
request says to sort them.      

1533
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,228
Okay, simple as that.           

1534
01:06:33,297 --> 01:06:37,832
The only thing not so           
simple, it throws, okay?        

1535
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:43,004
Just like context save throws,  
context execute also throws.    

1536
01:06:43,073 --> 01:06:45,539
So, you could put in            
a try question mark,            

1537
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:48,942
in that case, if the execute    
fails, and usually it's gonna   

1538
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:51,411
fail because your predicate     
is wrong, or something.         

1539
01:06:53,114 --> 01:06:56,182
Like your predicate just makes  
no sense then you could fail.   

1540
01:06:56,251 --> 01:06:57,916
If it's gonna fail,             
you're gonna get back nil,      

1541
01:06:57,985 --> 01:06:58,984
if you do try question mark,    

1542
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:00,652
remember that's what try        
question mark means.            

1543
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,054
It means try this, and          
if it fails, give back nil.     

1544
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:04,188
But it if doesn't fail,         

1545
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:06,524
then you're gonna get           
an optional array.              

1546
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:08,892
And that array is               
gonna be empty,                 

1547
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:11,928
if it couldn't find anything    
that matches your request, or,  

1548
01:07:11,997 --> 01:07:14,130
it's gonna be full of objects,  
okay?                           

1549
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,832
Tweets, or Twitter users,       
an array of tweets, or          

1550
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:18,200
an array of Twitter users,      

1551
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,501
at least that's what it's       
gonna look like to you,         

1552
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,404
it's not quite that,            
looks like it, all right?       

1553
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,939
That's the result you're        
gonna get back, so, again,      

1554
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:26,974
super simple querying.          

1555
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:31,445
Now, you might be a little      
scared of doing this request,   

1556
01:07:31,513 --> 01:07:35,415
what if it's matches            
a million things, okay?         

1557
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,818
Are you gonna get a million     
Tweets back in one              

1558
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:39,719
request like this?              

1559
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,621
The answer is no.               

1560
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:45,658
This array that you get back    
is really super smart array.    

1561
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:48,693
It doesn't actually bring       
the data in from the database,  

1562
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:51,496
until you start asking for      
it, okay?                       

1563
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:53,964
So until I ask for              
the Twitter user,               

1564
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,133
a certain Twitter               
user's information,             

1565
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,401
the Twitter user's name, the    
Twitter user's screen name,     

1566
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:00,403
the Twitter user did not get    
faulted from the database.      

1567
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:01,904
This is called faulting, okay?  

1568
01:08:01,973 --> 01:08:03,706
And so, these objects,          
you can imagine,                

1569
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,941
they're kind of shells,         
empty shells.                   

1570
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,276
And until you crack             
open the shell and              

1571
01:08:07,344 --> 01:08:08,810
start looking inside,           

1572
01:08:08,879 --> 01:08:10,811
it doesn't actually             
get the data for you.           

1573
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,546
And the reason this             
matters to you is,              

1574
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:15,482
if you go in the debugger,      
or you do a print statement,    

1575
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:20,220
like this one where you say,    
for user in recentTweeters      

1576
01:08:20,289 --> 01:08:23,423
fetched user whatever,          
when you print that out,        

1577
01:08:23,492 --> 01:08:26,159
it's not gonna print the,       
a Tweeter user object,          

1578
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,261
it's gonna print some           
kind of faulting shel.          

1579
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,529
Because you haven't             
actually asked for              

1580
01:08:30,598 --> 01:08:32,631
any of the data inside          
that thing yet, so              

1581
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:34,065
it hasn't faulted yet.          

1582
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:34,899
But if you say, for             

1583
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:38,169
user in recentTweeters and      
say fetched user named, and     

1584
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,438
now you say user.name, now you  
are faulting this object in.    

1585
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:42,205
In fact, this for               

1586
01:08:42,274 --> 01:08:45,809
loop would fault all these      
objects in to memory.           

1587
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:47,410
Okay, fetch them all,           
cuz you're asking for           

1588
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:48,411
the name of every single one.   

1589
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,445
Boom, fault, fault, fault,      
they're all coming in.          

1590
01:08:50,514 --> 01:08:53,449
Now, it doesn't do it one by    
one, it faults in batches,      

1591
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:55,717
it's really high performance,   
so,                             

1592
01:08:55,785 --> 01:08:57,752
you know,                       
don't worry about that.         

1593
01:08:57,821 --> 01:09:00,455
But just, I just don't          
want you to be surprised        

1594
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:01,054
when you go in                  
the debugger and                

1595
01:09:01,123 --> 01:09:02,957
you're like, I printed out      
this Twitter, user and          

1596
01:09:03,026 --> 01:09:04,858
there's no screen name,         
what's going on?                

1597
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:06,492
Well, it hasn't faulted it in.  

1598
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:07,993
In fact,                        
the debugger you could say,     

1599
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:09,862
print the user.name,            

1600
01:09:09,931 --> 01:09:13,332
and it would fault it in,       
okay, give it to you.           

1601
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:17,568
All right, I told you I was     
gonna talk about Core Data      

1602
01:09:17,637 --> 01:09:19,470
thread safety, so here it is.   

1603
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:22,873
NSManagedObjectContext,         
the context thing,              

1604
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:24,775
that thing that you're          
sending executes to,            

1605
01:09:24,844 --> 01:09:27,544
that thing that you're hitting  
save, the things that you're    

1606
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:30,280
using to create Tweet,          
Tweet, subcontext,              

1607
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:33,817
colon whatever, that handle on  
database is not thread safe.    

1608
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:38,420
A context can only              
be used on the queue            

1609
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:41,156
that it was created on,         
period.                         

1610
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:44,492
If you past a context           
to another queue,               

1611
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:47,194
like you tried to               
dispatch off to some            

1612
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:50,030
global concurrent queue, and    
you pasted the context, or      

1613
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,866
even just pasted a Tweet,       
okay, that's not gonna work,    

1614
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,335
cuz that Tweet was created      
on this other context.          

1615
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:56,870
So in fact,                     
not only the context,           

1616
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:59,372
but everything that you         
create on that context          

1617
01:09:59,441 --> 01:10:01,907
has to all be done              
in the same queue.              

1618
01:10:01,976 --> 01:10:03,175
So now you're                   
probably thinking,              

1619
01:10:03,244 --> 01:10:07,145
well how the heck do I          
do multithreading then?         

1620
01:10:07,214 --> 01:10:10,315
Cuz a database especially,      
you can imagine, for            

1621
01:10:10,384 --> 01:10:13,584
temple one to load your         
database off the main queue,    

1622
01:10:13,653 --> 01:10:15,853
cuz you, you might be loading   
lots and lots of things.        

1623
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:16,586
Now your queries,               

1624
01:10:16,655 --> 01:10:19,255
your probably gonna do those    
on the main queue because,      

1625
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:20,890
the user's looking              
at that information.            

1626
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,157
You want it to be               
highly responsive.              

1627
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:25,794
Okay, it's probably worth,      
and core data is super fast,    

1628
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:27,029
especially with queries.        

1629
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,797
So, you could probably do       
that on the main queue.         

1630
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:29,464
But loading it up,              

1631
01:10:29,532 --> 01:10:31,432
you probably don't              
want to do that.                

1632
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:33,734
All right, so,                  
how do we do multithreading?    

1633
01:10:33,803 --> 01:10:36,570
Although that we do             
multithreading in Core Data,    

1634
01:10:36,638 --> 01:10:43,110
is each database can have       
multiple contexts, okay?        

1635
01:10:43,179 --> 01:10:47,247
So, the database underneath,    
is multithreaded,               

1636
01:10:47,315 --> 01:10:50,850
it can have multiple            
contexts writing to it.         

1637
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,784
Okay, completely                
different context,              

1638
01:10:52,853 --> 01:10:55,820
writing to the same database,   
in different queue's even, so   

1639
01:10:55,889 --> 01:10:57,622
it's fully multithreaded.       

1640
01:10:57,691 --> 01:11:00,992
So that means we had to have    
a context for every queue.      

1641
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,361
Whatever queue we're going      
to access the database,         

1642
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,896
we have to a context            
in every queue.                 

1643
01:11:04,964 --> 01:11:07,230
Now I'm gonna show you how      
to create a context, or         

1644
01:11:07,299 --> 01:11:07,997
on another queue, so            

1645
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:10,467
you can do something with       
that queue in a second here.    

1646
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:12,101
But first I want to talk        
about this important            

1647
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:15,471
method in context               
called performBlock.            

1648
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,373
performBlock just               
takes a closure,                

1649
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,807
a closure that                  
takes no arguments,             

1650
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:22,677
returns no arguments, and       
it will ensure, this is         

1651
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:27,381
an insurance method, it will    
ensure that everything inside   

1652
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:32,086
that closure happens on the     
right queue for that context.   

1653
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,955
Okay, so this,                  
don't get confused,             

1654
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:38,125
this method does not dispatch,  
you know,                       

1655
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:42,562
cause background thrading,      
this is just making sure that,  

1656
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,998
that closure executes           
on the right queue.             

1657
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,433
So this is a way that           
you can kind of be safe.        

1658
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:50,735
And some might argue you        
should put performBlock around  

1659
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:53,238
every single call to every      
Core Data thing you ever do,    

1660
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:56,307
because that will ensure that   
you'll never have a problem     

1661
01:11:56,376 --> 01:11:59,811
where you're accessing          
the context not on it's queue.  

1662
01:11:59,879 --> 01:12:01,778
Okay, it accidentally,          
you got some bad code.          

1663
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:06,483
Now, that might be a little     
bit overkill especially if      

1664
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:09,352
you're mostly using             
the main queue anyway, and      

1665
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:12,355
you really, maybe you only      
use background queues for       

1666
01:12:12,424 --> 01:12:15,324
this tiny little bit of         
processing on the side.         

1667
01:12:15,393 --> 01:12:17,993
It's not like you have          
the tons context and            

1668
01:12:18,062 --> 01:12:20,695
lots of different queues        
all going at each other.        

1669
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:22,564
So, it might be overkill.       

1670
01:12:22,632 --> 01:12:24,466
But if you're doing             
anything where you have,        

1671
01:12:24,534 --> 01:12:27,202
truly have multiple context     
on multiple queues and          

1672
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,572
they're access and things,      
this is a good way to be safe.  

1673
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:35,175
Okay, so all this does is it    
makes it so you are safe.       

1674
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:39,346
The code inside that block      
will be executed on the proper  

1675
01:12:39,415 --> 01:12:40,947
queue for that context.         

1676
01:12:41,015 --> 01:12:43,516
Even if it has to dispatch,     
it will do it if it has to.     

1677
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:44,917
If it doesn't                   
have to dispatch,               

1678
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,786
if you're on the right queue,   
it'll just execute it, fine.    

1679
01:12:47,855 --> 01:12:49,387
But if you're on the wrong      
queue right now and             

1680
01:12:49,456 --> 01:12:50,055
you execute this,               

1681
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:52,056
it will dispatch it             
to the right queue.             

1682
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,991
There's also                    
performBlockAndWait,            

1683
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,659
which will get it on            
the right queue and             

1684
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:58,062
wait until it's done, and       
then continue in your queue.    

1685
01:12:59,298 --> 01:13:01,597
Okay, but this doesn't          
really talk about,              

1686
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:05,100
how do I get another context    
in a different thread, right?   

1687
01:13:05,169 --> 01:13:07,969
I wanna do some code            
on another thread.              

1688
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:09,370
Where do I get a context?       

1689
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:12,840
The only context I know how to  
get right now is viewContext.   

1690
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:14,909
That's the main                 
queue's context,                

1691
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:16,143
that's the only                 
only one I can get.             

1692
01:13:16,212 --> 01:13:18,812
Okay, well, you're gonna        
use this really cool method     

1693
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:20,013
in persistentContainer.         

1694
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:24,050
This is new in iOS 10 and       
a really cool method,           

1695
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:25,185
super cool.                     

1696
01:13:25,253 --> 01:13:27,954
It makes it really easy to      
do background process on        

1697
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:29,188
Core Data.                      

1698
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:31,256
It's called                     
performBackgroundTask.          

1699
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,292
Remember, this is a function    
on persistentContainer that     

1700
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:36,327
you get from the AppDelegate.   

1701
01:13:36,396 --> 01:13:38,129
And this takes a closure.       

1702
01:13:38,197 --> 01:13:42,866
This closure has one argument,  
the argument is a context.      

1703
01:13:42,935 --> 01:13:45,569
And that context is             
appropriate for use             

1704
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:49,172
on this other thread that this  
is going to create for you.     

1705
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,107
So this performBackgroundTask   
finds another queue,            

1706
01:13:52,176 --> 01:13:55,044
not the main queue,             
some other queue.               

1707
01:13:55,113 --> 01:13:58,346
And it creates a context        
in that other queue, and it     

1708
01:13:58,415 --> 01:14:02,584
executes your closure on that   
other queue in the background.  

1709
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:05,153
Now, it's                       
a convenience method.           

1710
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:07,855
So if you really needed         
to control the quality of       

1711
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:10,724
service, for example, the       
queue and all the, okay, well,  

1712
01:14:10,793 --> 01:14:11,558
you can't use this.             

1713
01:14:11,626 --> 01:14:14,694
But 99.99% of the time,         
whatever quality of             

1714
01:14:14,762 --> 01:14:17,330
service that queue is           
getting is the right one for    

1715
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:19,499
Core Data cuz Core Data         
knows its business.             

1716
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:21,633
So you're gonna do it.          

1717
01:14:21,702 --> 01:14:25,169
Now, inside this closure        
couple of things really         

1718
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:26,037
be careful of.                  

1719
01:14:26,105 --> 01:14:28,839
One, never use                  
viewContext in here.            

1720
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:32,242
Do you see why that would       
be horrendously bad to          

1721
01:14:32,311 --> 01:14:34,911
use viewContext                 
inside this closure?            

1722
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,781
Because this closure by         
definition is not executing on  

1723
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,415
the main queue.                 

1724
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:41,350
By definition this              
closure is on a separate        

1725
01:14:41,419 --> 01:14:42,718
queue on a background queue.    

1726
01:14:42,787 --> 01:14:44,452
That's the whole                
point of this thing,            

1727
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,121
is to put this thing            
on another queue.               

1728
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:48,255
So never use                    
viewContext in there,           

1729
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:50,257
that's why it's in red, okay?   

1730
01:14:50,326 --> 01:14:55,062
The second thing is don't       
forget to save this context.    

1731
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,629
If you do a whole bunch         
of stuff in here and            

1732
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:58,264
you don't save,                 
you just did for                

1733
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,699
nothing cuz you did in memory.  

1734
01:14:59,768 --> 01:15:02,601
And then this block went away,  
you're never gonna get that     

1735
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,804
context back again,             
that data is lost.              

1736
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:08,507
Which all gonna leave the heap  
and then nothing ever happens.  

1737
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:10,875
It never gonna get              
committed to the database.      

1738
01:15:10,944 --> 01:15:12,944
So, don't forget to             
save before you leave.          

1739
01:15:14,113 --> 01:15:15,679
Now, when you save,             

1740
01:15:15,748 --> 01:15:18,515
it will push it down            
to the database and             

1741
01:15:18,584 --> 01:15:23,186
your other context like your    
viewContext will see it, okay?  

1742
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:26,022
And so these two contexts, the  
one that's happening on this    

1743
01:15:26,091 --> 01:15:27,423
background and                  
the viewContext.                

1744
01:15:27,492 --> 01:15:29,291
They're working on              
the same database, so           

1745
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,192
when this one saves,            

1746
01:15:30,261 --> 01:15:33,027
boom this guys is gonna         
start seeing those changes.     

1747
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:36,430
I'm gonna talk a little bit     
how react to seeing those       

1748
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,266
changes in a minute here.       

1749
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,334
Okay, so,                       
everyone understand this?       

1750
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:43,703
Cuz you're gonna have to        
do this in assignment five.     

1751
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:47,040
And I want you to do all your   
loading off the main queue,     

1752
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,709
and all your fetching           
on the main queue.              

1753
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:56,315
All right, Core Data is huge.   

1754
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:56,948
Huge.                           

1755
01:15:58,351 --> 01:15:59,484
I can't cover it all.           

1756
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:02,085
It's got optimistic locking,    
for                             

1757
01:16:02,154 --> 01:16:03,053
those of you that               
know about database.            

1758
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:06,423
It's got optimistic locking     
and all that database stuff.    

1759
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:10,025
It has full undo, redo,         
which is incredible.            

1760
01:16:10,094 --> 01:16:13,462
It obviously knows how to       
roll back unsaved changes.      

1761
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:15,330
Okay, if you have               
changes in memory and           

1762
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:16,297
you want to roll                
some of them back,              

1763
01:16:16,366 --> 01:16:17,966
you can do that                 
before you save.                

1764
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:20,534
It knows about staleness,       
like, if I make a fetch,        

1765
01:16:20,603 --> 01:16:23,870
how long before I really wanna  
fetch it again because I don't  

1766
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:26,206
trust that the data             
hasn't changed, right?          

1767
01:16:26,274 --> 01:16:28,574
How long it takes for           
the data to get stale.          

1768
01:16:28,643 --> 01:16:31,710
And a lot of other              
things in the Core Data.        

1769
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:33,212
So, I can't cover it all,       

1770
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,247
there's not enough              
time to do that.                

1771
01:16:35,316 --> 01:16:37,749
Cuz we're trying to talk about  
a whole another topic about     

1772
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:39,217
But you'll want to check the    
documentation, you won't need   

1773
01:16:39,218 --> 01:16:40,617
Core Data here.                 

1774
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:43,521
anything else of this stuff to  
do your homeworks, of course,   

1775
01:16:43,589 --> 01:16:45,689
I'm just trying to get          
you started with this.          

1776
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:48,224
But you need to know that this  
stuff is in there, so that      

1777
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:52,562
one day when you go out and do  
some significant iOS database   

1778
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:54,764
stuff, you'll know that these   
features are out there.         

1779
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:01,503
All right, the next topic here  
is Core Data and UITableView.   

1780
01:17:01,572 --> 01:17:05,306
As you can imagine, this is a   
marriage made in heaven, okay?  

1781
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,908
Because you got this database,  

1782
01:17:06,977 --> 01:17:09,244
got all this big data           
sets in there and               

1783
01:17:09,312 --> 01:17:13,681
what is the UI we use to        
show big data sets in iOS?      

1784
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,982
UITableView.                    

1785
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:18,152
Okay, UITableView is great      
at showing arbitrary large      

1786
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,288
data sets in our                
arbitrary UIs, right?           

1787
01:17:22,357 --> 01:17:23,655
We can do custom                
table view cell,                

1788
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:26,191
we can do anything UI we want.  

1789
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:30,429
So, this is so common that      
Apple has invented this very    

1790
01:17:30,497 --> 01:17:33,965
important class called          
NSFetchedResultsController.     

1791
01:17:34,034 --> 01:17:36,333
This is not a viewController,   
okay?                           

1792
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,403
This is a controller that       
controls Core Data and          

1793
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:40,571
UITableView talking together,   

1794
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:44,607
but it's not in its fetch       
results view controller, okay?  

1795
01:17:44,676 --> 01:17:47,277
And all this                    
NSFetchedResultsController      

1796
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:50,513
does is it hooks up an          
NSFetchRequest that you create  

1797
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,481
to a UITableView.               

1798
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,651
And it hooks them up in such    
a strong way that if anything   

1799
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,087
changes in the database that    
would cause that fetch request  

1800
01:17:59,156 --> 01:18:02,090
to return different results,    
it updates the table            

1801
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:04,993
automatically, you don't        
have to do anything.            

1802
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:09,096
So this is an active            
live hookup between             

1803
01:18:09,165 --> 01:18:14,467
the NSFetchRequest and          
the TableView, okay?            

1804
01:18:14,536 --> 01:18:17,370
Even if some other context are  
changing the data, it doesn't   

1805
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,807
matter, it's always keeping     
that TableView up to date.      

1806
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:25,011
So I'm gonna talk               
about how we do this,           

1807
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,980
how we use                      
an NSFetchedResultsController.  

1808
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:31,550
I'm even gonna provide you      
some kind of free code          

1809
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:32,984
to do some of it.               

1810
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:34,586
You'll have to type in a        
little bit of the rest of it.   

1811
01:18:34,654 --> 01:18:37,455
But it's,                       
it's pretty easy to do.         

1812
01:18:39,191 --> 01:18:40,657
So how fundamentally does       

1813
01:18:40,726 --> 01:18:42,725
NSFetchedResultsController      
work?                           

1814
01:18:42,794 --> 01:18:46,596
Two ways, one,                  
it has a delegate and           

1815
01:18:46,664 --> 01:18:50,600
that delegate you set to be     
your UITableViewController.     

1816
01:18:50,668 --> 01:18:53,001
And whenever the                
FetchResultsController sees     

1817
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:53,802
something happening             

1818
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:56,638
in the database that would      
affect that fetchRequest,       

1819
01:18:56,706 --> 01:18:59,707
it tells the table view         
controller, hey, do this,       

1820
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,843
add this row, add a section,    
reload this row, whatever,      

1821
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:09,349
it uses UITableView primitives  
to update the table, okay?      

1822
01:19:09,418 --> 01:19:10,350
I'm gonna show you,             

1823
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:12,318
I'm gonna give you the code     
that does that part of it,      

1824
01:19:12,387 --> 01:19:14,454
that implements the             
NSFetchedResultsController's    

1825
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,422
delegate, okay, so              
that's one way it does it.      

1826
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:18,758
The other way that              
the NSFetchedResultsController  

1827
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:21,493
works is that it provides       
implementation for              

1828
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:24,763
all of your UITableView data    
sources methods, right?         

1829
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:26,631
Because the contents            
of your table                   

1830
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,131
are coming out                  
of the database,                

1831
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,668
so NSFetchedResultsController   
lets you know all of them, how  

1832
01:19:30,736 --> 01:19:33,436
many sections, how many rows    
and sections all that stuff.    

1833
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:35,204
In fact,                        
this is what it looks like,     

1834
01:19:35,273 --> 01:19:37,874
this is the implementation      
that you're gonna put in to     

1835
01:19:37,942 --> 01:19:41,077
your controller when you have   
fetchedResultsController.       

1836
01:19:41,146 --> 01:19:42,077
The first thing you're gonna    

1837
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:44,212
do is you're gonna create a     
fetchedResultsController, and   

1838
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,448
I'm gonna show you how          
to do that in a moment.         

1839
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,382
And so you're always            
gonna have a var called         

1840
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,518
fetchedResultsController, and   

1841
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:53,386
it's gonna be of type           
NSFetchedResultsController.     

1842
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,056
And when you have that var,     
now you can implement your      

1843
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,659
sections, number of sections    
in TableView by saying return   

1844
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:04,731
fetchedResultsController        
.sections.count, okay?          

1845
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,231
Those are a lot of              
optionals in there, so          

1846
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,934
we'll default to one section.   

1847
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:10,969
And then to get the number      
of rows in a section,           

1848
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:12,771
you're just gonna say the,      

1849
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:14,539
you're gonna get                
the sections first by saying    

1850
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:16,640
fetchedResultsController?.sec-  
tions.                          

1851
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:21,445
And as long as you have some    
sections, sections.count        

1852
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:24,748
greater than zero, then you're  
gonna return the sections in    

1853
01:20:24,817 --> 01:20:27,650
that section that's passed      
to you number of objects.       

1854
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:31,087
Okay, so that code, that's it,  
that's all of your, those two   

1855
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:34,390
methods, that's the entire      
implementation if you're using  

1856
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,491
a fetchedResultsController,     
okay?                           

1857
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,394
And then of course,             
there's cellForRowAt, okay,     

1858
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:41,629
you gotta implement that,       
that one too,                   

1859
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:44,298
you're gonna use                
fetchedResultsController.       

1860
01:20:44,367 --> 01:20:48,869
And the most important thing    
about cellForRowAt is you need  

1861
01:20:48,938 --> 01:20:53,274
to know what's at that row,     
which thing in my database is   

1862
01:20:53,343 --> 01:20:56,909
at that row in that             
section in my table.            

1863
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:00,480
And you get that by asking the  
fetchedResultsController with   

1864
01:21:00,549 --> 01:21:02,481
this method objectAtIndexPath.  

1865
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:05,117
So you just say                 
fetchedResultsController,       

1866
01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:08,520
give me the object, and that    
object is gonna be a tweet, or  

1867
01:21:08,589 --> 01:21:11,189
a Twitter user, or              
whatever, some entity.          

1868
01:21:11,258 --> 01:21:13,691
Give me an object               
at the index path               

1869
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,262
that cellForRowAt               
indexPath is asking me for.     

1870
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,363
So now I have the Twitter       
user or the tweet,              

1871
01:21:19,432 --> 01:21:21,232
I can easily load up my UI.     

1872
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,667
You know, pass it off to my     
UI, custom UITableView cell,    

1873
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,902
or if I have a subtitle cell,   

1874
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:27,970
just take a couple of           
things out of there and         

1875
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:30,105
put it in the text label        
in the detailed text label,     

1876
01:21:30,174 --> 01:21:31,340
you see what I'm saying?        

1877
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:34,642
But you can see that            
the fetchedResultsController,   

1878
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:37,512
that code in yellow right       
there in the middle of          

1879
01:21:37,581 --> 01:21:39,180
cellForRowAt indexPath,         

1880
01:21:39,249 --> 01:21:42,416
that's doing all the work       
to figure out what tweet or     

1881
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:45,653
what Twitter user is at this    
row in the table, okay?         

1882
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:47,120
So those code on                
the last slide and              

1883
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:49,789
the code on this slide, you'll  
have to type that code in any   

1884
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:53,392
time you're using               
an NSFetchedResultsController.  

1885
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:56,028
Now, on the previous slide,     
one of the things was var       

1886
01:21:56,097 --> 01:21:58,330
fetchedResultsController        
equals something.               

1887
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:00,566
So now let's talk               
about how we create             

1888
01:22:00,634 --> 01:22:03,001
a fetchedResultsController,     
okay?                           

1889
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:04,769
So this is what                 
the initializer for             

1890
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:07,304
NSFetchedResultsController      
looks like here.                

1891
01:22:07,373 --> 01:22:09,273
It takes a request, a context.  

1892
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:11,074
Obviously, it doesn't           
know what database              

1893
01:22:11,143 --> 01:22:12,375
we're fetching in.              

1894
01:22:12,444 --> 01:22:15,444
And then it's got               
a sectionNameKeyPath.           

1895
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:19,682
That sectionNameKeyPath         
is the var in                   

1896
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:24,519
that entity that,               
whose value is a string,        

1897
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:28,891
which is the title of           
the section it's in, okay?      

1898
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:31,425
That's how you do sections      
with fetchedResultsController.  

1899
01:22:31,494 --> 01:22:33,928
You just have to, and you       
might have to invent this or    

1900
01:22:33,997 --> 01:22:35,195
even calculate this.            

1901
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:38,265
But all of your tweets or all   
your Twitter users, if they're  

1902
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,800
gonna be in sections,           
they all have to have a var,    

1903
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:43,870
which is a string, which is     
the section they're in, okay,   

1904
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:45,738
the name of the section         
they're in.                     

1905
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:49,341
And as long as they have that,  
then the fetchedResults will,   

1906
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,843
will make the sections and      

1907
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:53,344
put them all in there           
in the right section.           

1908
01:22:53,413 --> 01:22:56,681
And we'll talk about            
cacheName in a second here.     

1909
01:22:56,749 --> 01:22:58,950
So we have to create            
a fetchRequest to put in here.  

1910
01:22:59,019 --> 01:23:00,818
So here's an example of         
creating a fetchRequest for     

1911
01:23:00,887 --> 01:23:01,719
tweets, right?                  

1912
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:03,486
So you recognize that           
first line there,               

1913
01:23:03,555 --> 01:23:05,655
creating a fetchRequest for     
tweets.                         

1914
01:23:05,723 --> 01:23:09,625
And I'm gonna sort by when      
the tweets were created, okay,  

1915
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:11,427
when the tweet                  
was tweeted out.                

1916
01:23:11,496 --> 01:23:15,664
And I'm gonna look for all the  
tweets whose tweeter's name     

1917
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:18,734
equals some name,               
the name, okay?                 

1918
01:23:18,803 --> 01:23:20,468
So it's gonna get all           
those tweets, and               

1919
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,903
I'm gonna set that request      
as the first argument there,    

1920
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:24,471
to NSFetchedResultsController.  

1921
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,807
By the way, notice              
NSFetchedResultsController is   

1922
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:31,612
also a generic type, and        
NSFetchedResultsController can  

1923
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:34,313
only control fetches for        
a certain type.                 

1924
01:23:34,382 --> 01:23:36,915
So you have to say what type,   
okay, what type of entity that  

1925
01:23:36,984 --> 01:23:39,618
your FetchController is doing,  
and these are the same type of  

1926
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:41,587
things that are in              
the rows of your table.         

1927
01:23:42,956 --> 01:23:45,056
Now that cacheName at           
the bottom is interesting.      

1928
01:23:45,124 --> 01:23:48,726
That is actually going to       
permanently cache the results.  

1929
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:49,793
it's gonna get the results      
out of the database and         

1930
01:23:49,794 --> 01:23:50,793
In other words,                 

1931
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:55,532
store on disk the result        
in some internal format.        

1932
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:57,667
And that's cool, and            
that storage, by the way,       

1933
01:23:57,735 --> 01:23:58,968
if you quit your app and        
come back,                      

1934
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:01,904
it will still use that cache,   
so it's quite efficient.        

1935
01:24:01,973 --> 01:24:03,605
But you have to be              
a little bit careful.           

1936
01:24:03,674 --> 01:24:06,708
You cannot change anything      
about your request.             

1937
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:09,578
As soon as you change anything  
about your request, like        

1938
01:24:09,646 --> 01:24:12,713
the name, the tweeter.name      
that you're searching for, or   

1939
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:15,082
what you're sorting by,         
or anything.                    

1940
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:17,718
Now that cache is invalid, and  
you'll have to invalidate that  

1941
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:21,354
cache, okay, and there's an     
API in there for doing that.    

1942
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:24,057
You can pass nil there if you   
don't wanna do the caching,     

1943
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:28,027
which for most reasonable       
sized datasets perfectly fine,  

1944
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:29,662
you don't really                
need the caching.               

1945
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,363
But I just wanna emphasize      
that if you change your         

1946
01:24:31,432 --> 01:24:34,700
request, your cache             
is now invalid.                 

1947
01:24:34,768 --> 01:24:38,169
And about that section key      
thing, something to be careful  

1948
01:24:38,237 --> 01:24:42,006
about there, too, is that       
whatever your sortDescriptors   

1949
01:24:42,075 --> 01:24:46,410
say that your rows would        
sort in, that has to be         

1950
01:24:46,478 --> 01:24:51,515
exactly the same order that     
your sections was sorted in.    

1951
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,484
In other words,                 
the FetchedResultsController    

1952
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:55,918
doesn't know how to             
like move things around         

1953
01:24:55,987 --> 01:24:58,521
because they sort out of        
order of their sections.        

1954
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,556
That's why a lot of times       
that we're doing sections,      

1955
01:25:00,624 --> 01:25:04,360
the first sortDescriptor will   
be sort by the section key      

1956
01:25:04,428 --> 01:25:05,927
name var, right?                

1957
01:25:05,996 --> 01:25:08,163
And then the second one         
will be sort by what we         

1958
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:10,865
really wanna sort by,           
because we have to make sure    

1959
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:13,935
that our entire table is        
sorted in section order.        

1960
01:25:15,338 --> 01:25:16,269
You see why?                    

1961
01:25:16,338 --> 01:25:17,737
Cuz otherwise it's just weird,  

1962
01:25:17,806 --> 01:25:19,072
things would all be             
in the wrong places.            

1963
01:25:20,274 --> 01:25:22,208
So                              
keyThatSaysWhichAttributeIsTh-  

1964
01:25:22,276 --> 01:25:24,810
eSectionName has to sort        
in the same order as your       

1965
01:25:24,878 --> 01:25:26,044
sortDescriptors.                

1966
01:25:27,847 --> 01:25:32,216
Okay, now, I told you that      
NSFetchedResultsController      

1967
01:25:32,285 --> 01:25:33,817
watches Core Data.              

1968
01:25:33,886 --> 01:25:36,953
It sees changes happening in    
there, and it updates it.       

1969
01:25:37,022 --> 01:25:38,888
And it does that with           
its delegate, okay?             

1970
01:25:38,957 --> 01:25:40,489
Its delegate wants              
to be the tableView,            

1971
01:25:40,558 --> 01:25:42,124
be the tableViewController,     
rather.                         

1972
01:25:42,193 --> 01:25:44,360
Cuz it's gonna tell             
the tableViewController, and    

1973
01:25:44,429 --> 01:25:45,627
it sends messages like this.    

1974
01:25:45,696 --> 01:25:48,663
So this is a typical            
NSFetchedResultsController      

1975
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:50,031
delegate method.                

1976
01:25:50,099 --> 01:25:53,200
Controller did change add       
indexPath for change type, and  

1977
01:25:53,269 --> 01:25:55,202
here's the new indexPath.       

1978
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:58,105
Okay, and these change          
types might be deleted or       

1979
01:25:58,173 --> 01:26:00,973
inserted or                     
modified or whatever.           

1980
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:04,176
Now, you have to put the code   
in there that would call        

1981
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:07,480
the right methods on the        
tableView to get the sections   

1982
01:26:07,549 --> 01:26:10,449
inserted or deleted or          
rows added or whatever.         

1983
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:13,819
But I'm gonna give you that     
code for free, okay, and        

1984
01:26:13,888 --> 01:26:16,120
the demo that I'm               
gonna do on Wednesday,          

1985
01:26:16,189 --> 01:26:19,757
I'm gonna have a class called   
fetchedResultsTableViewContro-  

1986
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:21,759
ller, which is                  
gonna be a class.               

1987
01:26:21,827 --> 01:26:25,796
And you can make that to        
be the super class of your      

1988
01:26:25,864 --> 01:26:28,598
UITableViewController.          

1989
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:32,001
And you'll just inherit         
this implementation of          

1990
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:36,039
the delegate, okay?             

1991
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,107
Yes, cuz that's                 
what I just said.               

1992
01:26:38,176 --> 01:26:41,276
Okay, so when you're using      
core data in UITableView,       

1993
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:44,079
the things to remember are,     
you're going to subclass        

1994
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:46,347
fetchedResultsTableViewContro-  
ller,                           

1995
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:48,950
the thing I'm gonna give you,   
so that you implement           

1996
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:51,585
NSFetchedResultsController      
delegate.                       

1997
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:54,621
You're going to add a var to    
your UITableViewController      

1998
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,856
called                          
fetchedResultsController, and   

1999
01:26:56,925 --> 01:26:58,557
you're gonna set                
its value to be                 

2000
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:01,995
an NSFetchedResultsController   
with the fetchRequest that you  

2001
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:05,464
want, okay, that you want       
to populate your table.         

2002
01:27:05,532 --> 01:27:08,700
Then you're gonna implement     
your UITableView data source    

2003
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:11,770
methods using                   
fetchedResultsController var    

2004
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:14,405
methods, just like I            
showed you in the slides,       

2005
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:15,907
character for character,        

2006
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:18,910
you can use the exact same      
things that are on the slide.   

2007
01:27:18,978 --> 01:27:21,679
Okay, and then it's all gonna   
magically work, all you'll      

2008
01:27:21,747 --> 01:27:24,014
have to do is inside your       
cellForRowAt indexPath,         

2009
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:25,748
you'll have the object,         
the tweet,                      

2010
01:27:25,817 --> 01:27:28,284
or the Twitter user, you        
just gotta load up your UI.     

2011
01:27:29,454 --> 01:27:30,919
After you have                  
all this set up,                

2012
01:27:30,988 --> 01:27:34,022
then you can proceed to using   
the fetchedResultsController    

2013
01:27:34,091 --> 01:27:35,890
in your tableViewController.    

2014
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:38,826
First thing you have to         
do is perform fetch on          

2015
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:40,161
the fetchedResultsController.   

2016
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:43,431
That will cause it to go out    
and do your NSFetchRequest,     

2017
01:27:43,499 --> 01:27:44,564
basically.                      

2018
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:46,766
It's not gonna pull             
all the data over, but          

2019
01:27:46,835 --> 01:27:49,836
it's going to basically bring   
over, do the same thing as if   

2020
01:27:49,905 --> 01:27:52,404
you had executed                
the fetchRequest yourself, and  

2021
01:27:52,473 --> 01:27:55,508
then you're gonna wanna do      
tableView View.reloadData.      

2022
01:27:55,576 --> 01:27:59,144
And that's because you want     
all of your datasource          

2023
01:27:59,213 --> 01:28:03,481
methods to be called, and you   
know that we've implemented     

2024
01:28:03,549 --> 01:28:07,118
all of them in terms of our     
fetch results controller as     

2025
01:28:07,187 --> 01:28:09,720
showed on the previous          
slides there.                   

2026
01:28:09,788 --> 01:28:12,556
And the only other thing        
you want to remember to do      

2027
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:15,692
is set your fetch results       
controller's delegate to be     

2028
01:28:15,761 --> 01:28:19,663
yourself and, again, we use     
that fetch results table view   

2029
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:22,732
controller code that added      
the delegate methods for        

2030
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:26,302
the fetch results controller    
to the UITableView controller   

2031
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:29,638
until we can do all the things  
that is necessary to            

2032
01:28:29,707 --> 01:28:33,074
be a fetchedResultsController   
delegate.                       

2033
01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:36,077
And what that buys you is       
that anytime in the database    

2034
01:28:36,146 --> 01:28:39,046
changes that would affect       
the NSFetchedRequest            

2035
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:42,383
that you wired up to your       
fetchedResultsController.       

2036
01:28:42,452 --> 01:28:45,218
Then, it will use that          
delegate to ask the table view  

2037
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,154
to update the rows or           
sections,                       

2038
01:28:47,223 --> 01:28:49,623
whatever happened to change.    

2039
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,258
So let me talk a little bit     
about what's coming up here,    

2040
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:55,027
on Wednesday, I'm gonna do a    
big demo that shows you all of  

2041
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:56,828
this stuff, as usual.           

2042
01:28:56,897 --> 01:28:58,530
Assignment five is              
going out on Wednesday,         

2043
01:28:58,599 --> 01:28:59,831
it'll be due                    
the next Wednesday.             

2044
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:03,300
It's going to be to add Core    
Data stuff to your Smashtag.    

2045
01:29:03,369 --> 01:29:08,839
On Friday,                      
very relevant section.          

2046
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:12,276
It's using CloudKit             
to do a database.               

2047
01:29:12,344 --> 01:29:15,145
Okay?                           
Now, Core Data and CloudKit,    

2048
01:29:15,214 --> 01:29:17,380
what, what are they,            
how are they related?           

2049
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:19,515
Well, Core Data is for          

2050
01:29:19,584 --> 01:29:22,285
doing things that you would do  
with a relational database,     

2051
01:29:22,353 --> 01:29:25,354
these powerful queries and      
searches and things like that.  

2052
01:29:25,423 --> 01:29:28,056
Cloud Kit is, what if you       
wanted to have a database       

2053
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,692
on the network,                 
in the cloud, okay?             

2054
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:34,028
A network that's being shared   
between multiple people or      

2055
01:29:34,097 --> 01:29:35,996
even by a single                
person on multiple,             

2056
01:29:36,065 --> 01:29:38,198
on multiple of their devices,   
or whatever.                    

2057
01:29:38,267 --> 01:29:40,934
So there quite different in     
the way they approach things.   

2058
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:44,971
In Core Data, we do the schema  
using this visual mapper.       

2059
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,607
In CloudKit, it's essentially   
schema on the fly.              

2060
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:51,310
As you start saving vars,       

2061
01:29:51,378 --> 01:29:54,980
it starts making this           
schema up for you, so           

2062
01:29:55,049 --> 01:29:57,816
it's a very different kind      
of way of thinking about.       

2063
01:29:57,885 --> 01:30:00,618
You don't think of it from      
a scheme of design point.       

2064
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,788
In advance, there's kind of     
more organic as you go and      

2065
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:04,655
also you don't have to,         

2066
01:30:04,723 --> 01:30:07,590
you know, kind of create this   
whole scheme of front and       

2067
01:30:07,659 --> 01:30:10,560
describe it, you can describe   
it as you use it essentially.   

2068
01:30:10,629 --> 01:30:14,531
So it's a very interesting      
comparison between the two.     

2069
01:30:14,599 --> 01:30:16,265
I wish I had time               
to do CloudKit.                 

2070
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:18,067
Last quarter,                   
I had the extra lectures.       

2071
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:20,035
I was able to do CloudKit       
as a whole lecture but,         

2072
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:23,205
we'll have to do it as          
a Friday section this week so,  

2073
01:30:23,273 --> 01:30:24,538
don't miss that.                

2074
01:30:24,607 --> 01:30:26,640
Next Monday is a holiday.       

2075
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:28,542
So no lecture and               
then next Wednesday,            

2076
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:30,111
I'm gonna go over               
your requirements for           

2077
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:31,979
the final project,              
which are required to do.       

2078
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:35,915
And I'm also gonna have a       
lecture as well on AutoLayout.  

2079
01:30:35,984 --> 01:30:38,417
We'll finally get               
to Autolayout and               

2080
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:41,654
how do that Autolayout stuff.   

2081
01:30:41,723 --> 01:30:43,522
I'd say, I just wanted          
to show you that and            

2082
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:46,025
I will see you                  
all on Wednesday.               

2083
01:30:46,093 --> 01:30:56,401
