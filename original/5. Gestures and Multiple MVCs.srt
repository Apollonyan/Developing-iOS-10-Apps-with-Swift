00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,210
>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P,  

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,114
Developing Applications for     
iOS, winter of 2017.            

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,650
This is lecture number five?    

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,251
Is that right?                  
The lecture number five?        

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,453
Yeah, lecture number five.      

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,990
Today we are going to start     
off with a little demo,         

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,594
where I'm gonna take the        
application we worked on last   

9
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,763
time, and add a model to it.    

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,999
Cuz we have only worked         
on the view part of that,       

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,036
building that nice              
cool FaceView,                  

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:40,305
now we are going to add         
a model to that MVC.            

13
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,841
Then we're going to come        
back to the slides and          

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,477
I'm going to do some            
slides on gestures.             

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,013
Obviously, you want to be able  
to have input to your app,      

16
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,915
you need to know how to         
do multi-touch gestures,        

17
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,518
we'll talk all about that, and  

18
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,220
then I will go back to our      
FaceView application and        

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,957
we will add some gestures,      
pinching, panning, tapping.     

20
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,894
And finally, I will go back     
to the slides again and         

21
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,062
start talking about             
multiple MVCs.                  

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,364
How to build bigger             
applications that are made out  

23
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,837
of combining MVCs, so that's    
what's on tap for today.        

24
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:17,809
So let's jump right back        
into this FaceIt Demo.          

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,346
And if you remember             
where we left off,              

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,048
we had this nice view,          
it was really cool because,     

27
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,220
in Interface Builder, we could  
do things like open the eyes.   

28
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,189
We could make it really big,    

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:36,261
we could make it really small,  
or anywhere in between.         

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,297
And we could change the color,  
green,                          

31
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,299
something like that,            
so that's cool.                 

32
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,302
And this is a nice reusable     
thing that's got a little       

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,104
public API to it.               

34
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,240
These inspectable               
things are all public,          

35
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,110
so, we can set the mouth        
curvature, we can open and      

36
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,878
close the eyes, we can change   
those things, like scale.       

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,882
And so, it's nice,              
it's this nice reusable face.   

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,086
And what we're going to do is   
make our MVC have a model.      

39
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,788
That model is not gonna         
match up exactly to what our    

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,324
FaceView can do, because        
that's the way models work.     

41
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,961
Models in the world are often   
databases or something, their   

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,031
schema doesn't quite match      
what view you have around.      

43
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,600
So you, the job of              
the controller is to interpret  

44
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,870
that model for                  
the view as best it can.        

45
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,075
And interpret input from the    
view also to affect the model.  

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,877
So let's go back                
to our controller,              

47
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,647
you can see that we have no     
model, we also have no outlets  

48
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,751
to our view here, so, let's     
add both of those things.       

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,021
I'm gonna start by adding       
an outlet to our FaceView, so   

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,758
remember how we do that, we     
got our storyboard on screen.   

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,929
I'm gonna get them both on      
screen at the same time and     

52
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,664
then I'm gonna control drag.    

53
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,333
And I'm control dragging        
from my FaceView to create      

54
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,134
an outlet to it,                

55
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,903
in exactly the same way I       
would control drag to a label,  

56
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:52,871
or button, or                   
anything else, so               

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,872
nothing special                 
about the FaceView.             

58
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,342
So I'm just gonna hold down     
control and drag in here,       

59
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,778
and I'm gonna                   
create an outlet,               

60
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,614
I'll call this                  
outlet my FaceView.             

61
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,184
That's a perfectly              
good name for it.               

62
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,689
Hit connect and there we go,    
we get this code that you're    

63
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:16,961
quite used to here, which       
is this IBOutlet weak var.      

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,098
Now we have a connection to     
our view, and remember, in MVC  

65
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,101
picture, the controller can     
have green arrows to its view,  

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,070
that's this, and it can have    
green arrows to its model.      

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,273
So let's create                 
a connection to the model.      

68
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,642
So what is gonna be             
our model of our MVC?           

69
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,978
I'm actually going to           
drag that in, right here,       

70
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,647
it's called facial expression.  

71
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,851
When you drag things in         
I strongly recommend            

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,587
you have this Destination,      
Copy items if needed,           

73
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,757
otherwise, when you drag in     
a class, or structure, or       

74
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,225
something, you'll               
be pointing to it.              

75
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,294
So if you change it in,         
wherever you got it from,       

76
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,729
it will be changing             
it in your project,             

77
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,631
so, it's usually                
what we wanna do.               

78
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,732
Maybe that might                
be what you want,               

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,835
in certain circumstances, but   
usually wanna copy it in.       

80
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,071
So let's take a look at this    
thing that I brought in,        

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,641
it's a struct and it's gonna    
be the model of our FaceView.   

82
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,044
And it's a really simple        
FacialExpression,               

83
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,380
that's what this represents,    
this struct.                    

84
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,015
And it has positions            
of the eyes,                    

85
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,052
open eyes, closed eyes,         
squinting eyes, unfortunately,  

86
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,955
we can't represent that in our  
view but it's in the model,     

87
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,123
we'll have to figure            
out the best we can do.         

88
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,360
It's also got a mouth, and the  
mouth can frown or smirk, or    

89
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,628
it can grin, or smile,          

90
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,732
notice there's nothing in this  
model about mouth curvature.    

91
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,233
It doesn't know anything        
about mouth curvature,          

92
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,301
it just knows about grins and   

93
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,971
frowns, things like that,       
that's what the model is.       

94
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,209
It's also kinda cool, it knows  
how to give you a happier       

95
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,211
version of itself, or           
a sadder version of itself.     

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,813
That's what these bars do,      

97
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,616
they just wanna return          
a happier or sadder.            

98
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,620
But primarily, this struct is   
just an expression to keep      

99
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,291
track of the state of           
the eyes and the mouth.         

100
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,027
So I'm going to,                
in my controller,               

101
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,329
create a green arrow to it,     
or a var for it.                

102
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,365
We're gonna call                
it Expression,                  

103
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,266
cuz it's a facial expression.   

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,570
And it's type                   
FacialExpression,               

105
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,441
and actually,                   

106
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,577
let's have a starting facial    
expression have eyes,           

107
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:18,516
which are, let's say, open,     
and a mouth, which is a grin.   

108
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,419
That sound like a happy         
place to start.                 

109
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:22,954
So that's great,                

110
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:27,725
now, remember that the primary  
job of a controller             

111
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,062
is to interpret the model for   
the view and vice versa.        

112
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,165
So I'm gonna add                
a private function here-        

113
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,367
you'll all often                
have a method or                

114
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,769
a number of methods in          
your controller like this.      

115
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,672
This one I'm gonna              
call updateUI.                  

116
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,275
And the job of this             
method is just to               

117
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,812
make the model match the UI,    
tha's i's job.                  

118
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,915
Tha's what this                 
method is gonna do.             

119
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,817
So, what do we have to          
do to make our model,           

120
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,586
this facial expression,         
match our UI?                   

121
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,487
Well, we have to deal           
with the eyes and               

122
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,389
we have to deal                 
with the mouth.                 

123
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,960
So, let's deal with the eyes    
first, that's pretty easy, so,  

124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,664
I'm just going to switch        
on my expressions.eyes.         

125
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,701
And in the case that the eyes   
are open in the model,          

126
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,539
then it's easy, I can           
just take my faceView and       

127
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,444
set it's eyesOpen to true,      
that's obvious how we do that.  

128
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,048
And this face, you remember,    
is this outlet,                 

129
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,552
that I just created there,      
and so, that's obvious.         

130
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,922
How about the case where the    
eyes are closed in the model?   

131
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,457
Well, that's                    
the faceView.eyesOpen,          

132
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,493
are gonna be false.             

133
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,729
And finally,                    
there's this case in the model  

134
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,900
where we're squinting,          
and here,                       

135
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,236
I don't really have             
a way to represent that.        

136
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,038
So I'm just going to say        
that in that case our eyes      

137
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,642
are gonna be closed because,    
squinting is more like having   

138
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,944
your eyes closed than           
having them open.               

139
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,481
But we don't always have        
exactly the view we want to     

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,517
represent our model, so we're   
doing the best we can here.     

141
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,888
So that is the eyes,            
pretty straightforward.         

142
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,756
Now the mouth,                  
I could do the same thing for   

143
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,125
the mouth here,                 
case expression.mouth,          

144
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,394
if it's a grin, set             
the mouth curvature to this.    

145
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,130
If it's normal, set             
the mouth curvature to that,    

146
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,198
but that code is                
kind of messy,                  

147
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,704
(make some space here so        
it's up higher), what if        

148
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,976
I created a little private var  
here, actually make it a let.   

149
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,513
And I'm gonna call it           
mouthCurvatures, and            

150
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,015
it's gonna be a dictionary,     
and in the dictionary,          

151
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:37,822
the values are gonna be         
FacialExpression.MouthPositi-   

152
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,625
ons, maybe a grin.              

153
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,594
And the value is gonna          
be a mouth curvature, so        

154
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,929
what's a good thing for         
a grin?                         

155
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,964
I think I decided 0.5.          

156
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,634
So this is just gonna           
be a dictionary with            

157
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,705
mouth position in the model,    
mouthCurvatures for the view.   

158
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,374
So I'm just creating this       
little mapping data structure.  

159
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,409
So let's do this for            
all, let's map this.            

160
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,811
For all of our facial           
expressions right here.         

161
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,313
Notice, by the way,             

162
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,818
that Swift was able to infer    
the type of this dictionary.    

163
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,254
Cuz it only has one item in     
it, and the types of those two  

164
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,724
things are obvious              
from what they are.             

165
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,028
So now that it knows that,      
by the way,                     

166
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,365
we can be a little more         
succinct and just say like,     

167
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,736
frown is -1.0 and               
smile is 1.0.                   

168
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:30,841
And obviously neutral           
would be 0.0.                   

169
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,709
Did I get them all?             

170
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,844
Smirk, how about smirk?         

171
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:38,717
Nope, that smirk                
we'll say is -0.5.              

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,119
So I've just put those mouth    
curvatures in this nice         

173
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,087
little table.                   

174
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,889
And so now in my update UI,     

175
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,392
I'm just gonna set my           
faceView's mouthCurvature       

176
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,496
equal to looking up in          
the mouthCurvatures,            

177
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:58,669
the model's mouth.              

178
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,639
I just kinda wanna do it this   
way to kinda show you that you  

179
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,475
don't always have to            
forcefully case every single    

180
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,844
thing when you have an enum.    

181
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,545
Sometimes you can use           
things like this.               

182
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,946
Now, I have an error there,     

183
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,314
anybody know why                
I have an error?                

184
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,149
Can anyone guess?               

185
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:16,988
Optional, yeah.                 

186
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,689
Alright, people are getting     
the optional thing.             

187
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,425
Good.                           
MouthCurvature,                 

188
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,593
what type is that?              

189
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,762
That is a double, and           
mouthCurvature sub              

190
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,632
expression.mouth, what          
type is that?                   

191
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,533
It's an optional double.        

192
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,337
And that's because this         
expression might not be         

193
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,506
in that dictionary.             

194
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,508
So I'm gonna use that           
defaulting thing we learned     

195
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,044
and say, if I can't find        
the expression mouth,           

196
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,047
we are gonna have neutral       
mouth, not smiling or           

197
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,383
frowning as our curvature.      

198
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,156
Now, we have this               
great update UI.                

199
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,192
When should we                  
call this thing?                

200
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,963
Well, we certainly need to      
call this thing anytime our     

201
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,364
model changes.                  

202
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,934
If our model changes to have    
a different expression,         

203
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,068
we gotta update our UI.         

204
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,836
So how are we gonna do that?    

205
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,439
We're gonna use this cool       
feature that I talked about     

206
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:13,478
last time called property       
observers, this didSet thing.   

207
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,648
So didSet allows you            
on any of your vars,            

208
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,417
if it changes,                  
you can execute some code.      

209
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,019
So anytime someone              
sets this expression,           

210
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm just going                  
to update my UI.                

211
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,827
Now, there's one other          
place that I wanna              

212
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,564
update my UI though, it's       
a little less obvious, and      

213
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,568
that is with this               
property observer.              

214
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,905
What am I doing here?           

215
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,607
This property is the outlet,    

216
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,743
that thing I Ctrl+dragged       
to my faceView.                 

217
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,681
And when we first start up,     
it's not set.                   

218
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,318
iOS takes a few microseconds    
to actually connect this up.    

219
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,487
That's why this is              
an optional, remember?          

220
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:01,492
In that short amount of time,   
what if the model gets set.     

221
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,927
Then update UI is not gonna     
work because the faceView       

222
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,830
hasn't been connected yet.      

223
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,632
So that's no good.              

224
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,836
Also we initialized our         
FacialExpression to be this.    

225
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:16,741
When you initialize something,  
didSet does not get called.     

226
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,144
didSet is only called if        
someone externally sets         

227
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,445
the expression.                 

228
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,648
The initial thing does          
not cause it to be set.         

229
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,451
So when is didSet               
gonna happen?                   

230
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,123
It's gonna happen only once     
when iOS hooks up this outlet   

231
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,526
to that faceView, then this     
didSet is gonna get called.     

232
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,362
That's the only time it's       
ever gonna get called.          

233
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,764
But at that time,               
we're gonna update our UI.      

234
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,401
Now, there's one other          
minor thing here.               

235
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:51,009
What if this gets called        
before this happens?            

236
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,412
This is gonna                   
crash our program               

237
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,517
because until this gets hooked  
up to iOS, this is nil.         

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,055
The only reason we don't have   
to say exclamation point here   

239
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,824
is cuz we have this implicitly  
unwrapped optional here, but    

240
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,092
it is an optional.              

241
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,794
So how can we deal with that?   

242
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,263
We don't want update UI         
to crash our program            

243
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,832
if the expression should        
happen to be set before that    

244
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,434
thing gets wired up.            

245
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,337
Now that thing gets             
wired up pretty soon, so        

246
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,639
probably not likely to happen,  
but it could.                   

247
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,775
So, we're gonna do that         
by using this chaining,         

248
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,544
this optional chaining.         

249
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,146
Remember the optional           
chaining,                       

250
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,880
where you can put               
a question mark there.          

251
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,384
And if the thing that you put   
the question mark on evaluates  

252
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,654
to nil, the rest of that line   
of code is just ignored.        

253
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,358
Perfect, faceView?.eyesOpen,    
if faceView's not set,          

254
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,726
we'll just ignore that.         

255
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,561
We're not gonna set             
the eyes open to anything,      

256
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,630
that line is just gonna         
be aborted immediately.         

257
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,768
This is something you often     
wanna do in your update         

258
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,572
UI things is protect against    
your outlets not being set      

259
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,880
And it's all gonna be fine,     
because if this got sent, and   

260
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,882
this has not been, and          
then this happens, and          

261
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,152
none of these lines of          
code execute, no problem.       

262
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,054
Because when this               
does get hooked up,             

263
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,655
this is gonna get               
called again.                   

264
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,258
And this time,                  
it'll be able to do it.         

265
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,829
So that it.                     

266
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,797
Let's run our                   
little app here and             

267
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,635
see if we get                   
an open eyes grin.              

268
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,768
In other words,                 

269
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,206
let's see if our UI reflects    
what's in our model.            

270
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,277
And sure enough,                
open eyes and a little grin.    

271
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:38,349
Let's try closed                

272
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:44,389
eyes, closed and                

273
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:50,061
a little frown.                 

274
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,862
Bingo!                          

275
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,966
So now we have done what we     
need to do in our controller,   

276
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,502
which is we're interpreting     
our model for our view.         

277
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,303
And anytime we set              
the model from now on,          

278
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,938
it's gonna update our           
view automatically.             

279
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,874
So the question is, what if     
I forgot to put this little     

280
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,143
question mark right here?       

281
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,814
Probably everything would be    
fine because you don't set      

282
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,584
your model before that Outlook  
gets wired up by iOS cuz it     

283
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,253
wires it up really soon.        

284
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,189
But if you did,                 

285
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,291
And so                          
that's how you would know,      

286
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,159
"oops", you messed that up.     

287
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,628
And sometimes you'll forget to  
put that question mark there,   

288
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,180
You do all your coding and you  
never call that model earlier.  

289
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,664
it's fine.                      

290
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,701
But then later, you change      
your code in a way that         

291
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,869
does accept the model before    
that thing, and boom.           

292
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,304
It crashes, and                 
you find it right away.         

293
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,372
That's why crashing is          

294
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,340
not always the worst            
thing in the world.             

295
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,076
Crashing helps you              
find bugs like that.            

296
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,778
You just hope you               
don't ship it out, and          

297
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,081
the customers find that         
bug for you that way.           

298
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,949
So that's it, that's all        
I wanted to do is show          

299
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,351
you now we have                 
a complete MVC.                 

300
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,053
It's got a model,               
it's got a view,                

301
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,389
it's got a controller that is   
interpreting for each other.    

302
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,624
So we can go back               
to our slides and               

303
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,692
learn about gestures, and       

304
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,561
then we'll add some             
gestures to this thing.         

305
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,735
So, how do we get               
those touches?                  

306
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,872
Now, it is possible             
to get notified                 

307
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,575
of raw touch events like        
a touch, meaning a finger,      

308
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,646
went down on the screen,        
it moved, it went up.           

309
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,981
Two fingers went down,          

310
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,351
you can find out all about      
that, but we never do.          

311
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,787
Too complicated, trying to      
figure out whether this, down,  

312
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,691
swipe, up is a swipe versus     
just moving, that's too hard.   

313
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,094
So we're gonna let              
iOS do that for us.             

314
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,464
And we call that interacting    
with multi touch,               

315
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,400
touch via gestures.             

316
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,167
So we're not even gonna         
learn about about the raw       

317
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,871
touch input in this course,     
just gestures.                  

318
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,341
So gestures are recognized      

319
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,678
by this class called            
the UIGestureRecognizer.        

320
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,413
Actually, not by                
UIGestureRecognizer itself,     

321
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,015
that's an abstract class.       

322
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,017
How many people know what       
an abstract class is?           

323
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,651
Raise your hand if you          
know what that is.              

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,253
Okay, so                        
I'll take a second to tell ya.  

325
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,089
So an abstract class is         
a class that, it's only         

326
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,659
purpose in life is to be the    
super class of other classes.   

327
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,097
And you never actually create   
an abstract class, okay?        

328
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,198
You only create                 
subclasses of it,               

329
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,468
instances of subclasses of it.  

330
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,304
So UI gesture recognizer's      
abstract, you would never       

331
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,307
create a UI, you'd never call   
an initializer on UI gesture    

332
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,074
recognizer.                     

333
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,009
Instead there's a bunch of      
subclasses which I'm gonna      

334
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,379
talk about and you would call   
the initializer on them.        

335
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,785
Now there's two parts to using  
a gesture recognizer here.      

336
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,554
One is you have to ask          
a UIView, please start          

337
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,491
recognizing this gesture, like  
a swipe or a pan or whatever.   

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,695
And then number two is, when    
the recognizer does recognize   

339
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,097
it, it wants to call you        
back with a handler,            

340
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,500
what we call a handler,         
a gesture handler.              

341
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,035
So there's the recognizer       
that you add to a view and      

342
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,838
then there's the handler,       
anybody can be the handler,     

343
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,672
as you'll see.                  

344
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,343
Almost always it's either the   
view itself or a controller,    

345
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,278
but anybody could be it.        

346
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,715
Now the adding of the gesture   
recognizer is done with         

347
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,518
a method called add gesture     
recognizer in UIView.           

348
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,922
And that method is usually      
called by controllers,          

349
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,857
why do controllers call that?   

350
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,428
That's because a controller     
wants to control whether        

351
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,198
the things in its view          
recognize certain gestures.     

352
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,767
They might wanna turn off       
certain gestures or or          

353
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,569
not turn on certain gestures,   
so                              

354
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,072
the controller is often         
controlling that.               

355
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,208
But occasionally you do         
get a UIView that will add      

356
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,379
a gesture to itself,            
like scroll view.               

357
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,182
Because a scroll view           
without the pan gesture, or     

358
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,718
without the pinching            
gesture if it can zoom,         

359
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,386
it's not even a scroll view.    

360
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,920
In other words,                 
that gesture is so              

361
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,124
fundamental to what a scroll    
view is that scroll view adds   

362
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,910
It'd, you'd have some API to    
turn it off, but it adds it to  

363
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:43,628
it to itself.                   

364
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:47,297
itself, it doesn't make some    
controller add this gesture,    

365
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,333
it just recognizes pan and      
pinch.                          

366
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,135
So mostly it's done             
by controllers,                 

367
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,369
though you'll see that.         

368
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,971
The second thing, the handler,  

369
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,506
okay that could either be       
the controller or the view.     

370
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,477
And what it really depends on   
is whether the gesture affects  

371
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,445
the model, or                   

372
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,148
whether the gesture affects     
just the view, okay.            

373
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,883
If the gesture only             
affects the view,               

374
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,586
then the view will              
probably handle it.             

375
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,088
But if the gesture affects      
the model directly,             

376
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,123
now the controller has to       

377
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,958
handle it because a view        
can't see the model.            

378
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,896
So the handler is either        
controller view and not, and    

379
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:19,830
you'll see that in the demo.    

380
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,166
I'm gonna have one handler      
that's a model, one and         

381
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,869
one that controls view and      
you'll see where we put them.   

382
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,839
Alright, so what's the code     
look like to add a gesture      

383
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,140
recognizer to a view?           

384
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,308
So for my example here,         

385
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,977
let's say you had a view,       
and in this code I'm gonna      

386
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,246
put here by the way is          
gonna be in a controller.       

387
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,549
Let's say it has one of its     
views that it wants to add      

388
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,987
a pan gesture, a pan gesture    
is put your finger down on      

389
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,255
the screen and move around.     

390
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,625
That's called panning           
around in the view.             

391
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:54,365
So this is what it looks like,  
a good place to add a gesture   

392
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:59,470
recognizer is in the didSet     
of an outlet for that view.     

393
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,740
Because that's, as soon as you  
can get a hold of it anyway,    

394
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,476
your iOS just sets,             
set that outlet up for you, so  

395
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,545
now you've got                  
a hold of that view.            

396
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,413
Now you can send                
a message to that view,         

397
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,048
addGestureRecognizer.           

398
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,318
Here I have this var, this      
outlet called pannableView,     

399
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,055
this is the view that I wanna   
add the pan gesture to.         

400
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,457
And you can see                 
that in its didSet,             

401
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,826
in other words when             
iOS wires this up,              

402
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,829
I'm going to do this            
addGestureRecognizer.           

403
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,799
First I'm gonna create          
the gesture recognizer,         

404
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,269
notice I'm saying               
UIPanGestureRecognizer, in it,  

405
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,904
in the initializer for that.    

406
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,074
Not UIGestureRecognizer,        
I'm creating a concrete         

407
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,309
gesture recognizer              
which is for panning.           

408
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,312
And that it has two arguments,  
the both of these arguments     

409
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,682
are the handler,                
how this thing is handled.      

410
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,117
The target is who's             
gonna handle it, and            

411
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,354
the action is what method       
is going to handle it.          

412
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,989
So now in the case here,        
the target,                     

413
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,758
I'm having the target will be   
myself, the view controller.    

414
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,127
This is obviously in the view   
controller because this is in   

415
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,395
an outlet property observer,    

416
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,364
that would only make sense      
in a view controller.           

417
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,634
And so the target is myself,    
I'm going to set,               

418
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,037
ask when this pan gestures      
starts to be recognized         

419
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:11,108
it's gonna be sending me        
the action here to handle it.   

420
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:15,278
And the action, you notice      
you have to say #selector to    

421
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,914
specify the method.             

422
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,750
Don't get confused the          
difference between a function   

423
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,152
type, a type that               
is a function and               

424
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,755
an actual method in a class.    

425
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,292
We use #selector to             
say this is a method,           

426
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,229
I wanna call this specific      
method in my class.             

427
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,898
And notice I've said            
ViewController.pan(             

428
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,569
recognizer:), well that means   
that the method that's gonna    

429
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,003
be called is called pan.        

430
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,041
And it has one argument, whose  
external name is recognizer:    

431
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,876
that's what that means.         

432
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,980
The ViewController., means      
that method is in myself.       

433
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,650
If it was in my view it         
would probably be like          

434
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,752
PannableView.whatever.          

435
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,055
This could also be self.pan,    
that's allowed,                 

436
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,658
saying pan.panGesture,          
pan recognizer in myself.       

437
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,562
Also you could omit it,         
that part in totally and        

438
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,764
just say panRecognizer:         
because the default is for      

439
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,933
it to be in myself.             

440
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,668
So there's three ways I         
could have specified that,      

441
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,239
viewController.pan, self.pan,   
or just pan.                    

442
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,674
But notice it does have         
that argument by the way,       

443
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,678
that argument is gonna be the   
recognizer passed back to me.   

444
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,347
So when the pan starts to be    
recognized, it's gonna call     

445
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,150
this method, and that           
recognizer is gonna be passed.  

446
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,220
This pan gesture recognizer     
called panGestureRecognizer     

447
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,289
right there, that's gonna be    
passed back to me each time.    

448
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,325
Now I've got a gesture          
recognizer for                  

449
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,162
panning, I just add             
it to the view,                 

450
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:42,599
only views are capable          
of recognizing gestures.        

451
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,768
So if you have                  
a gesture recognizer,           

452
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,339
the only addGestureRecognizer   
method in the entire UI kit is  

453
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,108
in UIView, so you have          
to send it to UIView, or        

454
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,576
a subclass of UIView.           

455
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,880
Let's talk about the handling,  
so now this is code,            

456
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:57,948
adds the handler so             

457
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,685
that the view is gonna start    
looking for pan gestures.       

458
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,053
And then when it finds them,    

459
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,189
it's going to start calling     
this pan recognizer.            

460
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,025
Now before we can               
look at the code for            

461
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,861
that we gotta understand        
a few things about it.          

462
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,830
One is that when you get        
a gesture like a pan or         

463
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,034
a pinch you need some concrete  
subclass specific information   

464
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,403
about it like a pan.            

465
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,638
You gotta know where it is,     
or a pinch,                     

466
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,974
you gotta know                  
much you pinched.               

467
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,944
So we have to understand        
what that means,                

468
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,681
now for a pan gesture           
recognizer, there are three.    

469
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,383
It's actually a little more,    
but there's this three very     

470
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,086
important pieces of concrete    
information about the pan.      

471
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,524
So, translation(in: UIView) is  
a function in the pan gesture   

472
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,793
recognizer where                
you can ask it,                 

473
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,296
how far has this pan            
moved since it started.         

474
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,466
How far has it moved from the   
start as I'm moving around,     

475
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,369
x and y, it's a CG point,       
so it's giving me the x and     

476
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,172
y where it's moved              
to since it started.            

477
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,408
Velocity says how fast          
is the finger moving.           

478
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,077
Is it kind of                   
whipping it around or           

479
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,312
is it going really slow?        

480
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,913
Because if it's                 
going really slow,              

481
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,348
maybe you wanna do a very       
you know, small drawing.        

482
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,683
And if he's whipping            
it really fast and              

483
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,818
you just wanna you know, moves  
something around, who knows?    

484
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,221
And then there's                
setTranslation,                 

485
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,724
now this last one is            
kinda cool because              

486
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,027
if you just know the start      
point and where it's moved to.  

487
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,397
You're not really getting       
the incremental move with       

488
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,832
each time you update,           

489
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,968
so you can actually set         
that translation to zero.       

490
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,404
And then instead of getting     
the distance from the origin,   

491
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,606
you're getting from the         
distance from the last time     

492
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,508
this was sent to you.           

493
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,043
Cuz this handler's going        
to be sent to you over and      

494
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,513
over as the pan moves           
around repeatedly.              

495
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,248
Hundreds of times as you        
move move around, so            

496
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,651
often you'll wanna set that     
translation back to zero,       

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,421
it gives you                    
incremental panning.            

498
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,890
You'll see that with some       
of the other concrete           

499
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,408
Now, the abstract superclass,   
the UIGestureRecognizer,        

500
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,858
ones as well.                   

501
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,729
even though you don't make one  
it still is the superclass of   

502
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,463
these things.                   

503
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,631
And you do inherit,             

504
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,969
especially this one very        
important var, Called state.    

505
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,504
And a state tells you           
the state of the gesture's,     

506
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,273
how it's being recognized.      

507
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,875
So all of these gesture         
recognizers start out in        

508
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,845
the state possible.             

509
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,614
It's possible this              
gesture could happen.           

510
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,917
And then, once it starts if     
it's a continuous gesture       

511
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,687
like a pan or a pinch you       
go to the state began.          

512
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,789
So this isn't like, " a pan!,   
I think it's started".          

513
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,392
So you'll get your handlers     
called and you can look at      

514
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,195
the state of the recognizer     
and say, it began.              

515
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,031
And then,                       
every time the finger moves,    

516
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,832
it's gonna get changed.         

517
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,001
It gets change, change,         
change, change, change,         

518
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:31,769
change, change.                 

519
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,071
You're getting your handler     
called repeatedly and           

520
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,473
no anything that's changing     
is those methods above,         

521
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,609
translation and                 
also the state.                 

522
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,343
Moves to change.                

523
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,045
And then, when the finger       
goes up, you get ended.         

524
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,348
You'll get your handler called  
and the state will be ended.    

525
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:50,254
Now, for a discrete             
gesture like a swipe,           

526
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,189
a swipe either happened or      
not.                            

527
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,157
When you're looking at          
a swipe you don't get           

528
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,893
the swipe started and it's      
moving across the screen and    

529
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,094
it comes off, no.               

530
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,396
Either the swipe happened or    
not.                            

531
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,297
So you would just               
get called once and             

532
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,501
the stage is gonna go straight  
to being ended or recognized.   

533
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,273
But you have to be a little     
bit careful of the states       

534
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,643
failed and cancelled.           

535
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,212
Failed might be because         
you started a gesture and       

536
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,647
then the system realized,       
my gosh,                        

537
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,749
that wasn't a pan gesture,      
that was the start of a swipe.  

538
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,984
Or something like that.         

539
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,286
And so,                         
it switches to a swipe.         

540
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,623
So you could have canceled,     
and then the other one,         

541
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,526
or the failed, and then you     
also didn't have canceled.      

542
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,429
You're in the middle of         
panning, phone call comes in,   

543
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,666
takes over your screen, person  
says, hello, how you doing?     

544
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,102
Well, clearly,                  
that pan gesture was canceled.  

545
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,437
So you could get that,          
as well.                        

546
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,973
So if you ever do anything,     
when you gesture ends,          

547
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,709
then you have to be careful     
to clean up when it fails, or   

548
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,010
gets canceled, as well.         

549
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,946
So that's the state.            

550
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,549
So let's take a look then,      
knowing what we know about pan  

551
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,684
gestures, what the handler      
would look like.                

552
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,521
So remember that                
the handler is called pan,      

553
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,990
recognizer is the argument      
there, and that is the pan      

554
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,425
gesture recognizer itself       
coming back to us.              

555
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,194
And its state will              
be different,                   

556
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,329
and we can ask it about         
translation and view and        

557
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,497
all those things.               

558
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,668
So the first thing we're gonna  
do is look at that state and    

559
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,436
I'm going to do the same        
thing whether the pan is,       

560
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,839
has changed or                  
whether the finger went up.     

561
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,407
That's kinda the last           
position of the pan,            

562
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,242
we're gonna do                  
the exact same thing.           

563
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,179
Notice by the way I'm using     
this switch thing fallthrough,  

564
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,214
hopefully you got that in       
your reading assignment.        

565
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,584
That basically just means that  
you wanna fall through to       

566
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,587
the next case cuz in a lot of   
languages that's the default,   

567
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,022
but in Swift it's               
not the default,                

568
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,223
you don't fall through.         

569
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,791
So fallthrough makes            
you fall through,               

570
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,359
it's a special key word.        

571
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,863
You could also say              
case.changed.ended: that        

572
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,397
would probably be               
actually better.                

573
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,299
We'll do that in the demo.      

574
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,072
So if the pan moves a little    
or it ends, then I'm going to   

575
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,676
get the translation from        
where we started at first       

576
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,479
by asking for the translation   
in the pannable view.           

577
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,815
That's the view the pan         
is having there.                

578
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:58,949
You're almost always            
gonna ask for                   

579
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,718
the translation in              
the pannable view.              

580
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,185
But you could ask for           
it in other views and           

581
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,388
it will convert to that view's  
coordinate system if you want.  

582
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,190
But almost always               
you're asking for               

583
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,259
the one in the pannable view.   

584
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,695
Then, I'm gonna take that       
translation that I'm gonna      

585
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,164
move and I'm gonna go do        
something with my app.          

586
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:14,965
Draw a line to,                 

587
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,267
if I'm tracking the finger      
with the line, or               

588
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,702
if I'm moving something,        

589
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,104
I'm gonna move the thing        
to the new position.            

590
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,974
Then, if I want, I can set      
translation to zero so          

591
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,243
the next time this              
handler is called,              

592
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,179
the translation is gonna        
be just the distance from       

593
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,782
the last time it was called.    

594
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,717
As opposed to the distance      
from where it all started.      

595
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,352
Where the pan started.          

596
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,454
So that's it.                   

597
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,090
That's how a handler works,     
it's easy.                      

598
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,126
Let's talk a little bit about   
some of the other concrete      

599
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:46,163
gestures.                       

600
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,932
So I put my fingers down,       
two fingers on the screen.      

601
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,968
Now, the scale is 1.0.          

602
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,370
If I put my fingers             
twice as far apart,             

603
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,971
now the scale is 2.0.           

604
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,108
If I go down to half as         
small now, the scale is 0.5.    

605
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,876
So that's what pinch is doing.  

606
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,179
It just constantly reporting    
what the scale is,              

607
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,147
relative to what                
the pinch started.              

608
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,482
Now, that scale is              
not read-only var, so           

609
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,884
you can reset it as well.       

610
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,587
And then,                       
you'll get incremental scale.   

611
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,923
How much the scale has          
changed since the last time?    

612
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,693
There's almost like you keep    
resetting the initial finger    

613
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,663
down, to scale,                 
if you set that scale to one.   

614
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:22,199
That's how you can get          
incremental scale.              

615
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,433
We'll do that in                
the demo as well.               

616
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,602
And then,                       
you also get velocity.          

617
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:29,839
How many points for a second    
or whatever this thing is, or   

618
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,074
not really a point fact.        

619
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,042
It's a scale factor.            

620
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,478
The percent of                  
scale is changing,              

621
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,046
how fast it's                   
changing per second.            

622
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,482
There's also a rotation         
gesture that's two fingers      

623
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,452
down, like turning a knob.      

624
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,254
Keep the two fingers down.      

625
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:44,921
You turn them.                  

626
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,690
You get the rotation there.     

627
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,492
The rotation is in radians.     

628
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,161
Again, it's not read only so    
you could reset it and          

629
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,263
get the incremental turning.    

630
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,432
And you also get the velocity   
and radians per second.         

631
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,501
How fast the person is          
turning their knob.             

632
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,471
There's also SwipeGesture,      
and again this is discrete so   

633
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,108
your handler's only             
gonna be called once.           

634
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,677
If it recognizes this gesture.  

635
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,777
Now, because of that,           

636
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,213
you have to configure           
a SwipeGesture recognizer.      

637
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,014
You create it and               

638
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,484
then you wanna set bars         
here like direction.            

639
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,386
You wanna left swipe,           
right swipe, up, down.          

640
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,554
And how many fingers?           

641
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,588
Two finger swipe?               

642
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,324
Three finger swipe?             

643
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,942
You set all that up when you    
create it because then it's     

644
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,493
One finger swipe?               

645
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,728
just gonna be looking for       
that.                           

646
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,197
And when it finds it, it's      
gonna call your handler once.   

647
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,465
Cuz it's discrete.              

648
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,001
Then there's tap gesture,       
similar to the swipe gesture    

649
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,137
in that you have                
to configure it.                

650
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,639
Number of taps,                 
like is it a double tap and     

651
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,275
is it two finger tap,           
you do that.                    

652
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,711
And then, it's gonna call,      
this is not purely a discrete   

653
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,381
gesture, like SwipeGesture,     
really you're looking for       

654
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,685
the state ended with            
a tap as well, but              

655
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,654
still you have to preconfigure  
it like a swipe, so             

656
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,490
it behaves almost exactly       
like a discrete gesture.        

657
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,828
So hopefully this will make a   
lot more sense when we show in  

658
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,563
the demo here, our demo we're   
gonna add three gestures,       

659
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,766
one is a pinch, that's just     
gonna make the face bigger and  

660
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,968
Which has nothing to do with    
a model that view only so       

661
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,102
smaller.                        

662
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,672
we're gonna put that            
handler in the view.            

663
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:13,176
And then, we gonna do pan,      
moving around.                  

664
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,878
Actually no, we're gonna        
swipe instead of pan.           

665
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,779
Let's use swipe.                

666
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,915
We do swipe and we swipe up     
to make our face happier or     

667
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,183
swipe down to make it sadder.   

668
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,985
And we'll have tab to open and  
close your eyes.                

669
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,153
How about that?                 

670
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,388
And those last two              
are obviously gonna affect      

671
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,458
the model, so the'll have to    
be handled by the controller.   

672
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,994
So le's go back to our          
code where we were here and     

673
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,396
how we can do this.             

674
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,633
Le's do the pinch first.        

675
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,469
Now, the pinch does't           
affect the model, so            

676
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,837
it can be handled by the view.  

677
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,839
So le's actually go             
over to our view and            

678
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:48,044
start by writing a handler for  
a pinch.                        

679
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,880
I'm gonna call this handler     
func changeScale because        

680
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,683
that's what it's gonna do,      
it's gonna be a pinch.          

681
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:59,589
So it's gonna change            
the scale of our head.          

682
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:05,796
And I'm gonna say byReactingTo  
a pinchRecognizer,              

683
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,932
Which will be UI                
pinch recognizer,               

684
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:14,904
pinch gesture recognizer,       
there we go.                    

685
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,440
So this is gonna                
be my handler.                  

686
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,777
So it's gonna get this pinch    
sent back to me all the time.   

687
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,712
I'm not gonna look at that      
pinch of scale to know          

688
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,714
how much to scale               
my own scale.                   

689
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:32,321
So I'm gonna switch on          
the pinch recognizer's state.   

690
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,358
Remember, it inherits that      
from UI gesture recognizer,     

691
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,560
which is the super              
class of this.                  

692
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,696
And in the case that            
it is changed, so               

693
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,532
the pinch has changed, or       

694
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,869
if it's ended, which means the  
user lifted the fingers off.    

695
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,307
Neither of those cases          
I'm gonna adjust my scale       

696
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,344
by whatever the scale is        
of the pinchRecognizer.         

697
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,247
Simple as that.                 

698
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:04,320
Now the thing about             
this though, what if            

699
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,425
I start my pinch here 1.0, and  
I move it just a little bit.    

700
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,058
Okay, fine.                     

701
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,961
My scale gets moved             
just a little bit.              

702
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,896
What if I moved all             
the way out to scale 2.0?       

703
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,764
Now my face gets 2.0.           

704
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,634
Now what if I move              
it out to 2.1?                  

705
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:23,373
This code's gonna make my face  
go from 2.1 to 4.2 you see.     

706
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,543
So I need to keep resetting     
this scale back to 1 all        

707
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,713
the time so I'm getting         
incremental scale changes.      

708
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,949
So I'm gonna say pinch          
recognizer .scale = 1.          

709
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,718
So I'm just                     
constantly resetting.           

710
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,687
Every time this gets called,    
and                             

711
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,490
I move my scale up,             
I'm gonna reset the scale so    

712
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,426
that I'm starting at one        
again with my pinch.            

713
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,963
That gives me incremental       
scaling there.                  

714
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,500
And of course we have to        
handle all the other cases      

715
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,300
of the state.                   

716
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,302
But I'm not gonna do anything.  

717
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,270
So I'm not gonna do anything    
when the pinch starts.          

718
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,906
If it gets cancelled,           
I don't care.                   

719
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,640
I'll just leave it              
whatever scale it was           

720
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,475
in at the time, etc.            

721
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,512
So I don't need to really       
handle any other cases.         

722
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,146
So that's it.                   

723
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,849
The handlers are super          
easy to write.                  

724
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,750
And this scale by the way,      

725
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,420
everyone understands, is this   
scale right here, this bar.     

726
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,521
This is our scale.              

727
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:14,758
Questions about that?           

728
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,793
So now we have a handler.       

729
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,030
We have someone to handle when  
a pinch happens in the view.    

730
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:24,768
Now all we need to do is add    
a recognizer that recognizes    

731
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,070
a pinch, and                    
calls the handler.              

732
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,639
So we're gonna do that up       
here in our face views          

733
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,175
didSet, because this is the     
first time we got a hold of     

734
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,777
that face view, and I want      
the face view to be the one     

735
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,681
that is recognizing             
this pinch.                     

736
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,583
So let's start by               
creating the handlers, so       

737
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,618
I'm going to create a local     
variabilities to make it clear  

738
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,753
to my handler.                  

739
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:48,958
It's a hashtag selector and     
its the faceView method,        

740
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,429
changeScalebyReactingTo,        
that's my handler.              

741
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,433
And then I am going to          
create a recognizer here,       

742
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,069
a pinch recognizer and          

743
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:03,073
it's going to be                
a UIPinchGestureRecognizer and  

744
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,641
of course we need               
the target and the action.      

745
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,744
That's all we need to           
create a recognizer.            

746
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:10,714
The target is going             
to be the faceView,             

747
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,083
it's gonna handle this          
thing itself, and               

748
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,786
the action is gonna             
be this handler.                

749
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,455
That's it.                      

750
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,991
Now we just need to             
take the faceView and           

751
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,628
add GestureRecognizer,          
the pinchRecognizer.            

752
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,264
And by doing that,              

753
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,899
face view is gonna start        
recognizing pinches.            

754
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,568
And when it recognizes one,     
it's gonna send this handler    

755
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,038
message right here              
to the face view.               

756
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:40,543
Now, if you                     

757
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:47,917
hope this is gonna work,        
let's see.                      

758
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,286
When you might ask,             
by the way,                     

759
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,055
if I have a mouse here,         
how do I do a pinch?            

760
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,723
In my thing, okay?              

761
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,858
Well the magic                  
there is option.                

762
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,293
If you press option, and look,  

763
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,662
I haven't even                  
touched anything,               

764
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,763
see I have two                  
things right there.             

765
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,065
And they kinda stay             
the same apart.                 

766
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,167
You can also do option shift,   
and they'll offset them, so     

767
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,702
you can pinch                   
anywhere you want.              

768
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,539
So anyway, do that.             

769
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,975
No, it's not working.           

770
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,812
See that?                       
How could that possibly be?     

771
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,914
Well, let's take a moment       
here and debug this.            

772
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,482
Why would this not be working?  

773
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,750
I put that pinch gesture.       

774
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:21,818
I added it.                     

775
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,420
I have a handler.               

776
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,322
Let's start by going            
to our FaceView and             

777
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,691
putting a break point right     
here in our handler Bar.        

778
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,394
And let's see if it's           
actually handling it okay.      

779
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,130
So I'm going to                 
go back to here,                

780
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,867
I'm going to get my             
option ready, pinch.            

781
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:38,835
Alright!                        

782
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,169
It broke.                       

783
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,339
It's definitely                 
calling my handler.             

784
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,173
So what's the problem?          

785
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:44,974
Let's do nothing.               

786
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,443
Let's say let's                 
print our scale and             

787
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,845
see if our scale                
is being change.                

788
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,447
I'm just gonna put a little     
print line in here.             

789
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,717
Use a combination of            
break points here and           

790
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,952
doing print debugging.          

791
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,786
And let's,                      

792
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,190
let's see if the scale is       
actually being changed.         

793
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,293
Here we go.                     

794
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,164
Again option key, and,          
it looks like it is.            

795
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,666
I see something in              
the background there.           

796
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,334
Sure enough look at that.       

797
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,739
Half, double,                   
it's working perfectly.         

798
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,373
Why is it not                   
redrawing that face.            

799
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,076
Can anyone thing why            
it's not redrawing.             

800
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,179
Cuz we know it's working.       

801
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:29,052
It's because when you change    
a var, like scale, right        

802
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,391
here it does not automatically  
know to redraw your view.       

803
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,993
That scale is changing fine.    

804
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,462
But the last time draw was      
called was when this first      

805
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,231
thing was drawn, you know,      
this method we have down here   

806
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,901
in the FaceView                 
called draw CGRect.             

807
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,668
This thing?                     

808
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,503
This was called when            
it was first drawn and          

809
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,406
it's never been called again.   

810
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:54,010
So without this being called    
there's no other way to draw    

811
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,446
my face I told you this         
is the only way to draw.        

812
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,783
So we have to get               
this to get called.             

813
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,185
And how are we gonna do that?   

814
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,355
Well we're just gonna slide     
right up here to scale, and     

815
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,292
any time scale get called,      
we're gonna do a didSet.        

816
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,795
Okay, and                       
inside here we're going to      

817
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,631
cause ourself to get drawn.     

818
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,331
Now how do I do that?           

819
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,701
Do I call draw like that?       

820
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,204
No, I see a lot of shaking      
heads no and absolutely not.    

821
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,940
Of course we never call draw.   

822
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,375
We get huge trouble             
if we do that.                  

823
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,376
What do we call instead?        

824
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,645
Anyone remember                 
from the slides?                

825
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,048
SetNeedsDisplay.                

826
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,152
So we're telling the system     
something about us has          

827
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,455
changed, we need to             
be re-displayed.                

828
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,924
So please, at your earliest     
convenience, re-display us.     

829
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:42,658
And that's what it's gonna do.  

830
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,830
And in fact, we want this       
on all of our things here.      

831
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:54,204
Any time any of these public    
things get changed by someone,  

832
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,805
we want to re-display.          

833
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,074
Let's put this                  
comment up here.                

834
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,910
So this is very common to have  
this little snippet of code     

835
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,746
after any var,                  
that when you change it,        

836
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,315
would change the way            
things look.                    

837
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,518
Now when we run we can          
actually go back here and       

838
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,652
get rid of this print.          

839
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,525
Pretty confident it's           

840
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:20,629
going to work now.              

841
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:24,567
Here I go on option again, and  
sure enough, look, our scale.   

842
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,703
Since our scale changes here,   
that setNeedsDisplay is         

843
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,740
asking to draw and iOS is       
accommodating us by drawing.    

844
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,143
That's pretty cool,             

845
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,413
that was quite simple to put    
in that gesture to do that.     

846
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,082
So let's go back now            
to our controller, and          

847
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:45,021
think about doing a gesture     
like a tap, to open the eyes.   

848
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,391
Now again, the view could       
be the handler for that.        

849
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,260
It arguably knows how to        
open an close its eyes.         

850
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,229
But if we made the view be      
the handler for a tap, and it   

851
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,866
opened the eyes, it would get   
out of sync with the model.     

852
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,569
Cuz the model is what says      
whether the eyes are open,      

853
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,303
not the face view.              

854
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,770
Face view is a slave.           

855
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,205
It's a minion of                
the controller,                 

856
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,907
it's supposed to do what        
the controller wants, so        

857
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:05,642
we can't do that.               

858
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,678
So we're gonna have to have     
the controller handle a tap,    

859
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,712
and change it in the model.     

860
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,248
And then it'll automatically    

861
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,384
update in the UI because of     
this line of code right here.   

862
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,055
Any time we change our model    
it's gonna update our UI.       

863
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,624
So we're gonna just have        
to have a handler for           

864
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,193
tap that just                   
changes our model.              

865
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,296
And that's all it needs to do.  

866
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,332
Let's try that handler first.   

867
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,702
Let's call that handler,        
how about toggleEyes            

868
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,671
cuz we're gonna tap and         
it's gonna with the eyes.       

869
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,206
If its opened it'll close,      
close it'll open.               

870
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:42,345
And toggleEyes is               
a tapGestureRecognizer thing,   

871
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:47,016
so I'm gonna say byReacting     
to a tapRecognizer              

872
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,254
which is a type                 
UITapGestureRecognizer.         

873
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:53,356
And here I'm just gonna say,    

874
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,625
if the tapRecognizer.state      
is ended.                       

875
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,194
So the tap happened.            

876
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:03,066
Then I'm gonna let eyes, which  
is FacialExpression.Eyes,       

877
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:06,135
just so that you know           
what type that is,              

878
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:10,206
equal whatever my current       
expression's eyes are,          

879
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:14,810
if the current expressions      
eyes are closed, then I'm       

880
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:19,448
going to have them be open,     
otherwise they will be closed.  

881
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,251
So I'm just toggling them.      

882
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:27,323
So eyes now which is of         
type FacialExpression.Eyes,     

883
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,592
it's got the opposite or        
whatever the old one had.       

884
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:35,365
Now, I'm gonna set my model to  
equal a new facial expression.  

885
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,766
That new facial                 
expression's eyes               

886
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,768
are gonna be this new           
eyes I just calculated.         

887
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,104
And the mouth is gonna be       
whatever the old mouth was.     

888
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,874
I'm not doing anything to the   
mouth, so I'm just gonna say    

889
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,376
expression.mouth, for           
the old one.                    

890
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,278
So here I'm changing            
my model and                    

891
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,380
that's gonna cause              
this didSet to happen.          

892
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,082
It's gonna re-draw my view and  

893
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,318
the eyes are gonna be the       
opposite of what they were.     

894
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,821
So that's the handler.          

895
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,489
That's gonna handle that.       

896
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,825
So now we have to add           
a tap gesture recognizer        

897
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:03,692
to our face view.               

898
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:08,064
So this time let's just         
say let tapRecognizer =         

899
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,600
UITapGestureRecognizer.         

900
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,703
And as always we just           
specify target and selector.    

901
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,838
So the target this              
time is not faceView,           

902
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,139
up here it was faceView.        

903
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,542
Now the target is myself.       

904
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,644
And the action is going to be,  

905
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,547
again I can say                 
faceView controller or          

906
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,751
I can indicate self dot,        
we'll do that, toggle eyes.     

907
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,825
And we need to put              
around this #selector.          

908
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:41,397
Cuz we need to turn it into     
that particular selector.       

909
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,966
Then again, I don't actually    
need that self in there,        

910
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,885
Looks a little better cuz it    
defaults to my own methods.     

911
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:47,737
I can just do that.             

912
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,040
So we got the tap               
recognizer created.             

913
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,610
Now we have to configure        
the tap recognizer              

914
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,011
because we want it to           
happen on single taps.          

915
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,148
So we could say for example     
numberOfTapsRequired = 1,       

916
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,618
that happens to be the          
default, so probably I won't    

917
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,786
need to actually say that,      
but we'll do it anyway.         

918
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,655
And now we need to turn it      
on and we do that by adding     

919
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,625
a gestureRecognizer             
to the FaceView.                

920
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,662
If you don't do this step       
of adding it to some view       

921
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,498
then that view is not going     
to be recognizing this.         

922
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,500
So it's not gonna               
be doing anything.              

923
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,836
Just an easy step               
to kind of forget.              

924
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:26,008
All right, so let's             

925
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:30,612
see if that works.              

926
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,683
All right, so tap,              
it's working.                   

927
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:38,554
Every time I tap,               
it opens and closes the eyes.   

928
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,856
And it's changing               
it in the model.                

929
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,158
So it changes the model,        

930
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,761
that causes the update UI to    
happen, this update UI does     

931
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,464
does this little thing          
to update the eyes.             

932
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:53,536
When it calls eyes open         
over here okay, eyesOpen.       

933
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,504
When it gets set,               
it calls NeedsDisplay,          

934
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,106
which causes                    
the thing to redraw.            

935
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,909
Everyone got that               
chain of events?                

936
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,146
Let's do one other one here.    

937
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,081
Which is to do a swipe.         

938
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,951
So I'm gonna have a swipe,      
where swiping up makes          

939
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,388
our face happier and            
swiping down makes it sadder.   

940
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,890
So this has to be handled       
in the controller.              

941
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,524
Why?                            

942
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,092
Because this is                 
affecting the model.            

943
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,761
Happiness is in the model.      

944
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,831
So I'm gonna have a func        
called increaseHappiness.       

945
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:26,135
It's just going to set          
the expression equal to         

946
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,071
the existing expression but     
happier.                        

947
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,942
I'll do a func                  
decreaseHappiness,              

948
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,077
i's gonna be the opposite,      

949
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:38,213
expression = the current        
expression but sadder.          

950
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,349
And these vars here,            
happier and                     

951
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:44,454
sadder, those are in the        
FacialExpression, right here.   

952
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,355
You can look at those later     
to see how they work.           

953
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:47,523
But basically the're            
just creating a new             

954
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:50,058
FacialExpression where          
the mouth is happier or         

955
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,461
the mouth is sadder.            

956
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,428
And then the mouth knows        
how to be happy or sad or       

957
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,132
it's using this raw value       
mechanism in enum, hopefully    

958
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,567
you've figured that out in      
your reading assignment.        

959
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,503
This is a great opportunity     
to go figure it out if you      

960
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,206
didn't.                         

961
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:08,744
Back in our controller here,    
we now have these handlers.     

962
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,414
Notice these handlers           
have no argument.               

963
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,182
Why do these handlers           
not have an argument,           

964
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,551
like this ByReactingTo          
guy down here.                  

965
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,786
Because a swipe gesture         
is discrete, so                 

966
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,456
we never have to look at the    
swipe gesture when it happens,  

967
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,258
we know it happened and         
that's all we need to know.     

968
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,160
So these handlers do not ever   
need to look at the state or    

969
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,297
anything like that, like a tap  
gesture or a swipe gesture or   

970
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,032
a hand gesture.                 

971
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:34,403
Let's add these guys to there,  
so                              

972
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:39,074
I'm gonna let                   
swipeUpRecognizer =             

973
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:46,849
UISwipeGestureRecognizer,       
again, target and action.       

974
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:49,318
Again, the target is myself     
because it affects the model.   

975
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:53,522
And I'm gonna have this be      
the selector increaseHappiness  

976
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,958
because this is swipe up.       

977
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,827
Okay, now I have                
to configure it.                

978
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:01,764
SwipeUpRecognizer's direction   
is up, and                      

979
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,733
now I'm gonna add it,           

980
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:09,272
faceView.addGestureRecognizer-  
(swipeUpRecognizer).            

981
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,772
And since swipeDown is so       
similar,                        

982
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,176
I'm just going to copy and      
paste here.                     

983
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,011
Copy and paste.                 

984
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,415
And we will change swipe        
up to be swipe down.            

985
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,854
And of course, the direction    
here now is down.               

986
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:29,192
And it's decreaseHappiness and  
so I decrease.                  

987
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,994
So I've added these two         
recognizers, up and             

988
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:32,929
down swiping.                   

989
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,697
And they're going               
to increase and                 

990
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,065
decrease our happiness          
in the model.                   

991
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,136
And when the model changes,     
update UI is called.            

992
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,505
We're gonna look up mouth       
curvature in that dictionary.   

993
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,206
We're gonnaset                  
the mouth curvature,            

994
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:46,475
that's gonna do the didSet,     
we're in good shape.            

995
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,778
So here we have a pretty sad    
guy, we'll open his eyes,       

996
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,914
then we'll close,               
no leave them open.             

997
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,015
Now we're gonna make            
him happier, and                

998
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,049
happier, and happier.           

999
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,551
Woo, he's really happy!         

1000
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,055
And swiping down, no,           
not so happy after all.         

1001
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,659
So that's it for gestures.      

1002
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:07,129
Gestures are super-simple and   
super-powerful cuz all          

1003
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:10,532
the logic going into detecting  
was that a swipe, or was that   

1004
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,969
a pan, or what was that,        
was all done for you by iOS.    

1005
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:21,243
Back to our                     

1006
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:26,716
slides.                         

1007
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,618
Time to talk about              
building bigger apps,           

1008
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:33,622
apps where we're gonna have     
multiple MVCs involved.         

1009
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,391
Not just our calculator MVC,    
but multiple MVCs.              

1010
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,528
Not just our face view          
controller MVC, but             

1011
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,230
multiple MVCs.                  

1012
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,735
So I showed you this picture    
from the MVC discussion and     

1013
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,937
you can see that the MVCs       
relationship to each other is   

1014
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:54,209
that one or more MVCs is part   
of the view of another MVC.     

1015
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,713
So let's see how that happens.  

1016
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:03,085
We combine these MVCs using,    
(I don't wanna say special,     

1017
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,188
because you could               
write your own), but            

1018
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:09,391
built-in MVCs that              
come with iOS.                  

1019
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,027
And these MVCs are built        

1020
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,796
using other MVCs as             
part of their view.             

1021
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,533
So, yes you can                 
build your own.                 

1022
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,535
So, for example, here's the     
three that we do most of our    

1023
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,704
building with here or pretty    
much all of our building,       

1024
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,706
multiple MVCs.                  

1025
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,708
There's the TabBarController,   
a SplitViewController and       

1026
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:27,977
a NavigationController.         

1027
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,879
So I'm gonna go into detail     
here about how each of these    

1028
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,282
controllers, are controllers    
of MVCs                         

1029
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,886
whose view is other MVCs.       

1030
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,089
So here's a TabBarController    
for example.                    

1031
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,158
If you look at what             
you see up there,               

1032
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:47,195
there are two MVCs              
on that screen, two.            

1033
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,732
One MVC is                      
the TabBarController.           

1034
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,334
It's what's drawing the little  
icons at the bottom.            

1035
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,103
You see those icons at          
the bottom, those four icons?   

1036
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,972
That MVC is doing that.         

1037
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,642
The other MVC is the thing      
surrounded in yellow,           

1038
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,011
a dashboard MVC,                
whatever that is,               

1039
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,213
something in the health         
app here or something.          

1040
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,249
That is drawn by                
a completely different MVC,     

1041
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,684
the dashboard MVC.              

1042
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,087
But notice how it's             
drawing inside the view         

1043
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,889
of the tab bar controller.      

1044
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,526
So, you're already seeing here  
how we're building an MVC out   

1045
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,461
of other MVCs.                  

1046
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,498
The tab bar controller has      
an MVC built into its view.     

1047
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,568
Now, what's interesting is      
this is very object oriented    

1048
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,872
in that those buttons along     
the bottom, both the icon and   

1049
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,807
the text on and                 
if they had a badge,            

1050
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:32,875
that would be there too.        

1051
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:37,179
Those are actually not being    
set in the TabBarController,    

1052
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,082
the TabBarController            
is grabbing them from           

1053
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,050
the dashboard MVC.              

1054
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,988
Grabs them from a var           
in the dashboard MVC,           

1055
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,724
it's a view UI controller       
bar called TabBarItem.          

1056
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,263
And TabBarItem has things like  
Badges, and titles, and icons,  

1057
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,465
things like that.               

1058
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,001
And of course, we can have      
more MVCs in the tab bar if I   

1059
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,271
click on that second            
icon right there,               

1060
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,340
I get a different MVC filling   
up this space at the top.       

1061
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,843
So now,                         
we've seen three MVCs so        

1062
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,646
far, dashboard, health data,    
and the TabBarController.       

1063
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,984
Right, now by the way, if you   
get too many tabs, if you put   

1064
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,187
six MVCs, for example,          
into a tab bar controller,      

1065
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,924
then you get a little more      
"..." icon on the right, and    

1066
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,593
you can click that and          
the user can get at those.      

1067
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:29,164
So a tab bar controller could   
have more than five MVCs.       

1068
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,966
But if you start                
getting more than five,         

1069
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,502
the UI gets a little clunky     
because their user is having    

1070
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,571
to go over and click that       
more to get to the other one.   

1071
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I kinda recommend if            
you have a tab bar,             

1072
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:39,808
don't put more than             
five MVCs in there.             

1073
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,812
So the question is, when we     
have the icons at the bottom    

1074
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,381
and like, the icons and         
the titles there.               

1075
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,651
And I said that it's getting    
that from the MVCs that         

1076
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,951
are being shown.                

1077
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:56,058
The question is,                
is the embedded                 

1078
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,027
MVC, like the health data one,  
or the dashboard one, is it     

1079
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,032
getting the button and the      
title there from the model?     

1080
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,433
And the answer is,              
that's up to that MVC.          

1081
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,304
Some MVCs might well do that,   
probably most are not because   

1082
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,808
it's kinda more of a UI thing   
what the icon and the text is.  

1083
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,744
Probably not part of the        
model, especially the icon.     

1084
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:23,151
Unlikely to be in the model.    

1085
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,356
We have more MVCs for a total   
of five MVCs on the screen.     

1086
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,691
The tab bar controller and      

1087
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,828
these four MVCs that            
are each of the tabs.           

1088
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:37,532
So this is the simplest         
way to combine MVCs.            

1089
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,335
But do you see what I mean      
when I say that these other     

1090
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:44,139
MVCs are part of the view       
of the tab bar controller.      

1091
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,743
They're actually even their     
views are embedded physically   

1092
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:52,915
embedded inside the tab         
bar controller's view.          

1093
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:54,716
So that's the simplest one.     

1094
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,552
Let's talk about                
the next simplest one,          

1095
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,153
which is split                  
view controller.                

1096
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:03,025
So split view controllers       
is two MVCs side by side.       

1097
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,694
You get to see them both        
on screen at the same time,     

1098
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,262
at least in landscape you do.   

1099
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,866
This one on the left            
here is a calculator MVC.       

1100
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,735
It doesn't look                 
much like yours but             

1101
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,037
you can imagine that's          
a calculator MVC.               

1102
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:15,837
That MVC,                       

1103
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,409
we call the master MVC of       
the split view controller.      

1104
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,044
And then on the other side      
there's a whole different MVC,  

1105
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,713
completely and                  
utterly different.              

1106
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:29,251
This one happens                
to be a graph of                

1107
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,486
what's in the calculator MVC.   

1108
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,888
And this is gonna               
look very similar               

1109
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,724
to your homework assignment,    
because that is assignment 3.   

1110
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,493
To build a graphing             
calculator,                     

1111
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,894
you're gonna be putting         
in a split view and             

1112
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,662
doing all the things I'm        
talking about today,            

1113
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,030
so pay attention.               

1114
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,098
So that we call a detail.       

1115
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,699
The reason we call              
that a detail,                  

1116
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,568
is almost always                
the right side,                 

1117
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:51,740
which is larger usually,        
whatever's in it happens        

1118
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,143
to be controlled by what's      
on the left by the master.      

1119
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,677
And that would be true here.    

1120
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:58,313
Cuz the graph on the right      
is showing whatever is in       

1121
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,280
the calculator on the left.     

1122
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,216
So if you change something in   
the calculator on the left and  

1123
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,719
hit its graphing button,        
it changes the details.         

1124
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:08,123
So the master is controlling    
the detail in that way.         

1125
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,693
Now, and this is what it        
looks like when these things    

1126
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,461
are side-by-side                
in landscape mode.              

1127
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,630
But what if you switch          
over to portrait?               

1128
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,632
Well, in portrait it just       
shows you the detail, but       

1129
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:22,204
you can swipe from the left     
and get the master to come      

1130
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:24,773
out on top of it and            
then do whatever you want.      

1131
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,074
It still updates                
the utility and                 

1132
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,476
you can swipe it                
out of the way.                 

1133
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,212
So that's split                 
view controller.                

1134
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,348
Super simple.                   

1135
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,717
Again, hopefully you're seeing  
that there are three MVCs       

1136
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,886
The split view controller's     
MVC, and these master and       

1137
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,987
up here.                        

1138
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:41,089
detail MVCs.                    

1139
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,459
The master details              
serve as the view of            

1140
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:45,427
that split view controller.     

1141
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,764
Notice that the split view      
controller itself has no UI.    

1142
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,432
It doesn't actually draw        
anything in the view,           

1143
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,103
it just uses the UI or the      
view of these MVCs to draw.     

1144
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,873
I guess, it draws the vertical  
line between the two,           

1145
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,743
that's probably drawn           
by the split view.              

1146
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,479
The most complicated one and    

1147
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,616
the most commonly used one,     
is a navigation controller.     

1148
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:12,354
Another MVC that uses           
other MVCs in its view.         

1149
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:16,358
So, here we see two             
MVCs on this screen,            

1150
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:19,027
navigation controller           
based MVC.                      

1151
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:22,231
And it's showing another MVC,   

1152
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,700
which I'm calling               
the all settings MVC.           

1153
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,004
In this particular view         
that you're looking at.         

1154
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,139
See on the top there's          
a gray bar that says            

1155
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,841
settings in there?              

1156
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,844
The gray bar, which is          
actually transparent and        

1157
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,214
showing the all                 
settings MVC behind it.         

1158
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,450
Kinda, fuzzed out               
a little bit.                   

1159
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,253
That gray bar is drawn by       
the navigation controller.      

1160
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,522
That and                        
a toolbar on the bottom,        

1161
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,657
which I'll talk about in a      
second, that's the only thing   

1162
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,193
that the navigation controller  
actually draws in its view.     

1163
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:55,029
The rest of its view,           
it fills up with another MVC.   

1164
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,598
The view from another MVC,      

1165
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,734
in this case the all            
settings MVC.                   

1166
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,107
The contents are all            
this "all settings MVC".        

1167
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,577
Just like with the tab bar      
controller where there was      

1168
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,213
that tab bar item that          
had like the icon and           

1169
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:11,846
the title on it.                

1170
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,949
Same thing with                 
the navigation controller.      

1171
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,484
That word settings at the top,  

1172
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:20,522
the navigation controller MVC   
is getting that word by asking  

1173
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,626
the MVC that it's currently     
showing what's your title.      

1174
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:29,898
It gets that from this          
var navigation item.            

1175
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,065
It's a UI view control thing,   

1176
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,002
just like tab bar item has all  
the tab bar things, navigation  

1177
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,306
has all the navigation,         
UI navigation things.           

1178
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,474
So if you look at the API for   
navigation item,                

1179
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:42,110
it has things in there like     
title, and I'm gonna show       

1180
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,812
you another property that it's  
gonna use in a second to get    

1181
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,282
more information to draw.       

1182
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,420
If I click in this              
table view actually,            

1183
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:55,157
if I click on general right     
there, then a new MVC is        

1184
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:59,427
gonna slide in on top of        
that old settings one.          

1185
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,597
Now, the old settings one is    
completely non-visible but      

1186
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,399
it's still there.               

1187
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:05,767
This is like a stack of cards,  

1188
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,736
where I've put                  
a new card on top.              

1189
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,005
The other card is no            
longer on screen, okay,         

1190
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,374
you won't see it any more.      

1191
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,811
But it still exists in memory,  
in the navigation controller.   

1192
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,081
So now we have three            
MVCs involved in this           

1193
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,185
Navigation Controller, the      
Navigation Controllers' MVC,    

1194
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,788
the all setting ones that is    
now in the back of this one,    

1195
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:31,059
and this one,                   
the General Settings MVC.       

1196
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,494
Now, by the way, there,         

1197
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,463
you can have toolbar buttons    
along the bottom here.          

1198
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,098
They look similar to            
the tab bar ones,               

1199
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,934
but they're                     
a little different.             

1200
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,470
That is set with the toolbar    
item, the var in                

1201
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,941
the General Settings MVC, not   
in the Navigation Controller.   

1202
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,944
So as new MVCs slide in,        
the toolbar buttons at          

1203
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,713
the bottom would change,        
because they're connected to    

1204
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:54,916
whatever happens to be on       
top of the deck of cards.       

1205
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:58,519
Notice also that                
there's a back button.          

1206
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,454
You see that back button?       

1207
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,055
It's called settings.           

1208
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,658
That button was automatically   
put there by navigation         

1209
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,826
controller.                     

1210
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:05,927
And if you click that,          

1211
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,563
it's gonna go back              
to the other card.              

1212
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:10,666
The all settings, so            
that's all done for you.        

1213
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:14,002
But if I click                  
somewhere in here,              

1214
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,106
like on Accessibility there,    
then it goes to another MVC.    

1215
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,376
Now we've seen four MVCs so     
far in this thing.              

1216
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:24,179
And if I click on Larger Text   
in here, I get yet              

1217
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,013
another MVC..                   

1218
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,015
Now we have five MVCs.          

1219
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,418
So these MVCs just keep         
stacking on top, and            

1220
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,320
each of the new one that        
comes on is its own world.      

1221
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,422
It's completely on its own.     

1222
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,592
And of course if we start       
pressing the back button up     

1223
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,862
there on the left, it goes      
back to the previous one.       

1224
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,698
Notice the title of             
the back button is even set     

1225
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,934
to be the title of              
the previous MVC so             

1226
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:49,103
you know what can happen        
when you click it.              

1227
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,506
And we can go all the way       
back to the all settings at     

1228
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:52,207
the very top.                   

1229
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,675
Now there's no back             
button because                  

1230
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,576
there's no other cards.         

1231
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,779
So that's what                  
navigation controller           

1232
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,214
looks and works like.           

1233
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,750
Okay, you guys have all seen    
this UI, I'm sure, in apps.     

1234
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,652
Super common.                   

1235
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,222
So let's talk a little bit of   
how the navigation controller   

1236
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,490
works behind the scenes.        

1237
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,959
How how you make                
this thing work.                

1238
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,194
So when do you need             
a navigation controller?        

1239
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,431
Well, let's see you have        
an MVC, right there, and        

1240
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,701
you got another whole pile of   
UI down here in the corner      

1241
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,304
that you wanna add,             
but just won't fit.             

1242
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:24,305
You wanna be able to do         
the accessibility stuff and     

1243
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,175
the larger texts and all that   
we saw on the previous slide.   

1244
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:27,976
But it obviously,               

1245
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,744
it's not gonna all fit          
in one phone screen so          

1246
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:30,945
you need more space.            

1247
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:35,116
So what you do is you create a  
new MVC that controls all that  

1248
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,120
UI that is completely           
independent of that.            

1249
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,722
And it just knows               
how to manage that.             

1250
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,624
Now they might share a model,   
because maybe they're           

1251
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:44,292
all looking in                  
the settings database.          

1252
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,127
That's fine.                    

1253
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,163
But they're not talking         
to each other in any way.       

1254
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,397
The only time they ever         
talk to each other,             

1255
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,932
is when it first                
comes on screen,                

1256
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,634
as you'll see in a moment.      

1257
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:55,938
So I have two MVC's now,        

1258
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,941
to control all the UI           
that I wanna present.           

1259
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,810
So let's use                    
a NavigationController to make  

1260
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,244
these come on screen.           

1261
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,913
And so                          
here's a NavigationController,  

1262
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,281
it's just MVC.                  

1263
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:11,586
It doesn't really have a model  
that's okay but it has a view.  

1264
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,989
And inside that view there is   
a special var that's pointing   

1265
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,359
to its view called              
RootViewController,             

1266
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:20,729
that's just points of to the    
controller of the MVC that's    

1267
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,098
at the root it's                
the base card.                  

1268
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,167
The all settings one we         
saw on the previous page.       

1269
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:27,001
So it just has this bar.        

1270
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,670
You just set that               
to something, and               

1271
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:29,471
now you'll have an MVC.         

1272
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,839
And as soon as you do that,     
as soon as you set that,        

1273
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,909
it's going to take              
that MVC's view and             

1274
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:36,444
put it in its view with         
that little gray bar.           

1275
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,780
And it's gonna ask it           
navigation item for             

1276
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,382
the title, and get the title.   

1277
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:42,350
Perfect example.                

1278
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:43,785
This is super simple.           

1279
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:48,323
And then let's say you have     
a button inside this UI, or     

1280
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:51,259
like a line in the table view,  
like get me more settings or    

1281
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:52,627
accessibility or whatever.      

1282
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,862
And you touch that.             

1283
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:57,832
Now, when you touch that, it's  
going to create one of these    

1284
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,368
MVCs on the right,              
it creates it at that moment.   

1285
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:02,804
As soon as you touch it,        
it creates a new one.           

1286
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,273
Every single time you           
go to a new card,               

1287
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,374
it creates a new one.           

1288
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,843
Not back, but every time you    
go forward to a new card,       

1289
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,278
it always creates a new one.    

1290
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,613
That's something I'm            
gonna say three or              

1291
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,614
four times in this slide so     

1292
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,715
as to make sure                 
you understand it.              

1293
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:18,686
This activity of going to       
a new one is called segueing.   

1294
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:23,891
This particular segue's called  
a show or a push segue.         

1295
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,561
Which just means a segue in     
a navigation control with       

1296
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,463
the stack of cards.             

1297
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,199
Now when you do that,           
you get the back button for     

1298
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,134
free, it just automatically     
appears up there because        

1299
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,036
that top bar like I say is      

1300
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,740
drawn by the navigation         
controller's part of its view.  

1301
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,409
And when you click              
that back button,               

1302
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,745
of course what happens          
is interesting here.            

1303
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:47,883
Of course this slides back,     
but what happened to that MVC?  

1304
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,717
Gone.                           

1305
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,054
Deallocated from the heap.      

1306
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,023
So when you go back,            

1307
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:58,526
whatever card was on            
top gets thrown away.           

1308
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,696
So MVCs, as you're kind of      
getting the picture here,       

1309
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,464
they're pretty ephemeral.       

1310
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,901
MVCs don't really stick         
around for a long time.         

1311
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,502
Now the root card on            
a Navigation Controller,        

1312
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,704
it's gonna stick                
around pretty long,             

1313
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,439
as long as that Navigation      
Controller is on screen.        

1314
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:14,108
But mostly MVCs kind            
of come and go.                 

1315
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:17,445
And it's their models that      
tend to be persistent.          

1316
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,379
When you create a new MVC,      

1317
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,715
you usually hook it up to       
a database or a network or      

1318
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,184
something, something            
persistent.                     

1319
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,452
And so that's why it's          
showing something new.          

1320
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:27,189
Or it's an MVC that showed      
something new every time.       

1321
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,627
So that's how a navigation      
controller works.               

1322
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,397
I'm gonna talk a little bit     
how we hook all of this up.     

1323
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,333
Because of course we're gonna   
do all this hooking up with     

1324
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,104
control drag in Xcode, that's   
how we hook everything up.      

1325
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:43,938
But I wanna talk a little       
bit about the code              

1326
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:44,806
behind so you know.             

1327
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,310
There's an important var that   
is in these viewControllers,    

1328
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:49,277
like tab bar controller, and    

1329
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,912
navigation controller,          
and split view controller.      

1330
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,547
It's called viewControllers,    
and                             

1331
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:56,017
it's an optional array          
of UIViewControllers.           

1332
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,318
And it means different          
things depending on             

1333
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:02,457
which one you're in.            

1334
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,194
each tab, with the left most    
tab's MVC's at 0 and then 1,    

1335
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,632
2, 3, 4 is just                 
the rest of the MVCs.           

1336
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:14,001
For a split view 0 is always    
the master, 1 is always         

1337
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,905
the detail, and there's never   
any other ones in this array.   

1338
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:21,743
For a navigation control, 0 is  
the base card, and 1, 2, 3,     

1339
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:25,513
4, etc., are the ones           
stacked on top, in order.       

1340
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,315
So that's how you can           
kinda get at them.              

1341
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:32,520
Now, we don't usually, this     
is a bar, it can be set but     

1342
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:35,623
we usually don't set this bar,  
we don't set the things,        

1343
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,993
we either use things that we    
do in our UI, which I'll show   

1344
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,629
you or even like in Navigation  
Controller, there's push and    

1345
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,934
pop methods to push MVCs on     
and pop them off of the stack.  

1346
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,272
Now, it's great to have this    
var ViewControllers, but        

1347
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,642
how do you get                  
the Split View Controller or    

1348
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,477
get the Tab Bar Controller      
if you're in one?               

1349
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,380
Okay if I'm the all             
settings MVC or                 

1350
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:04,052
I'm one of the health data      
ones that we saw on the tab     

1351
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,687
bar, how do I get the           
navigation controller I'm in,   

1352
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,823
or the split view I'm in or     
the tab bar I'm in?             

1353
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,826
Well all UIViewControllers      
have these three vars,          

1354
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,461
tab bar controller,             
split view controller and       

1355
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,528
navigation controller.          

1356
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,231
And if you are in one of        
those things this will return   

1357
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,867
the one you are in.             

1358
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,702
And if you're not in one,       
it will return nil.             

1359
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:22,604
So that's how you find out      

1360
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:24,039
the Split View Controller       
you're in.                      

1361
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,941
And you can use                 
the combination of              

1362
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,141
For example, if you're          
the Master in a Split View,     

1363
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,274
these two things.               

1364
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,513
you can find your               
detail MVC by saying            

1365
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:33,415
what's the split view           
controller I'm in?              

1366
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,017
Get its View Controllers,       
look at View Controller sub 1   

1367
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,653
because that's                  
always the detail.              

1368
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:39,521
So I just clicked and           
went up and over and got it.    

1369
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,322
You see?                        

1370
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,058
And I use the question mark,    
the optional chaining there     

1371
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,992
because I might not be in       
a split view controller.        

1372
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,694
And then it obviously           
will return nil for             

1373
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,864
my detail, which is fine cuz    
it would be nil if I'm not in   

1374
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,666
a split view controller         
obviously there's no detail.    

1375
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,904
Now, how do we wire             
all this stuff up?              

1376
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,439
Of course we're gonna           
do it all graphically.          

1377
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,775
Let's start by at looking       
at the split view and           

1378
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,510
how we do this.                 

1379
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,279
Now to create a new view        
controller, whether it's one    

1380
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,215
of these view controllers       
of view controllers that we     

1381
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,517
were talking about or just      
a regular view controller.      

1382
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:12,186
You go down to the object       
pallet and you drag it out      

1383
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:15,456
into your storyboard just like  
a button, except you're just    

1384
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,825
dragging to open space and      
it's created there.             

1385
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,562
Now when you drag a split       
view controller out, it's       

1386
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,666
actually gonna drag out kind    
of empty, detail and master.    

1387
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:26,467
You never want that.            

1388
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,236
I don't know why it             
really does that.               

1389
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,737
Just delete those.              

1390
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,839
You're obviously gonna          
have your MVC's like your       

1391
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,208
calculator and your graphing    
view controller sitting in      

1392
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,410
your storyboard and you're      
gonna drag the split view       

1393
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,779
controller and you're           
gonna wire it up to those.      

1394
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,083
So you're gonna delete any of   
the extra junk that comes out.  

1395
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,319
Then you just                   
Ctrl+drag like we do,           

1396
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,422
our favorite gesture in         
a face builder, is Ctrl+drag.   

1397
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,992
We just Ctrl+drag from          
the split view controller       

1398
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,194
to the master and               
to the detail, so I'll get up.  

1399
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,263
So this is what                 
that looks like.                

1400
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,432
Here I've got split view        
controller on the left.         

1401
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,767
I've got calculator view        
control on the top and          

1402
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,236
I've got a graph and            
control view on the bottom.     

1403
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,370
So I'm just gonna control,      

1404
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,972
drag from the split             
view controllers,               

1405
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,174
the calculator controller.      

1406
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,510
This little black window        
is gonna come up.               

1407
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,914
I'm gonna choose master view    
controller from the list and    

1408
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:16,951
that's gonna hook that          
one up top to my master.        

1409
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,155
Then, I'm gonna Ctrl+drag to    
the bottom one, the black       

1410
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,924
window comes up I'm gonna       
choose Detail View Controller   

1411
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,659
then it's gonna make            
that connection.                

1412
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,361
Okay, as simple as that.        

1413
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,363
Now you've got the split        
view with master that's         

1414
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,566
calculator of your              
controller and                  

1415
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,169
detail that is going to be      
a graphic view controller.      

1416
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,205
Now, one interesting            
thing here though,              

1417
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,774
is this split view does         
not work on an iPhone.          

1418
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:43,344
Well it works on iPhone plus,   
iPhone six plus or              

1419
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,013
seven plus, the kind of big     
ones, but it does not work on   

1420
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,783
a normal iPhone, it's just not  
enough screen real estate to    

1421
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:52,053
really do the split view        
thing, so we can't do it.       

1422
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,989
So, what we really want to      
do is build a UI though that    

1423
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,191
works on all the devices.       

1424
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,827
So to do that,                  
what we do is we're gonna wrap  

1425
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,763
the master and                  
the detail if we want.          

1426
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,466
We're gonna wrap them in        
a navigation controller.        

1427
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,901
And then when                   
they're on iPhone,              

1428
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,102
they won't use                  
the split view part,            

1429
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,838
they'll just use                
the navigation controller.      

1430
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,808
It's really cool,               
how it figures this out.        

1431
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:17,178
The way to wrap a view          
controller that's in there,     

1432
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,047
you wanna wrap it in            
a Navigation Controller,        

1433
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,282
you just go to                  
the Editor menu,                

1434
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,116
the same place we did           
embed and stack view,           

1435
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,151
and some of that.               

1436
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,887
And you select the whole        
scene of your MVC, and          

1437
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,623
you go to the Editor Menu and   

1438
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,993
you say embed in                
navigation controller.          

1439
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:34,295
So I've selected that top,      
calculate and control and       

1440
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,563
when I do that,                 

1441
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,199
it's going to put it inside     
a navigation controller.        

1442
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,067
Did you see that?               

1443
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,236
Now, I've got the flip view,    
it points to a navigation       

1444
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,372
controller, so the master of    
this flip view is actually      

1445
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,808
that navigation controller,     
and then the navigation         

1446
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,311
controller root view            
controller is the calculator.   

1447
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,146
So, if you're on a device       
that can do split view,         

1448
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:53,114
like an iPad or a plus,         

1449
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,316
you're going to get             
the whole split view effect.    

1450
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,684
But if you're on                
just an iPhone,                 

1451
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:58,486
it's not going to               
do the split view.              

1452
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,721
It's just going to do           
the navigation controller.      

1453
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,989
So, when you look               
at the detail,                  

1454
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,192
it's going to slide it in.      

1455
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:06,761
Whereas if you're on            
a iPad in landscape,            

1456
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,764
you're gonna see Master and     
Detail at the same time.        

1457
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:13,568
Now, you can also do            
the same thing- yeah, and so    

1458
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,703
the UINavigationController      
is the Master,                  

1459
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,639
as, as I talked about.          

1460
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,074
So you can do the same          
thing with the Detail.          

1461
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,410
Now why would you ever          
do that with the Detail?        

1462
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,111
Because yo've already done      
it with the master and          

1463
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,513
so you gotta click in the       
master to get to the detail,    

1464
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,516
so yo're kinda already gonna    
be in a navigation controller,  

1465
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:29,584
and tha's true.                 

1466
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:32,186
But wha's kinda nice            
about putting the detail        

1467
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:35,223
in a navigation controller is   
you get that little title bar,  

1468
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,524
you know the little             
gray title bar?                 

1469
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,391
So now, your master and         

1470
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,561
your detail both have           
a title bar on the top and      

1471
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:40,961
they match up nicely.           

1472
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,930
So if you wanna title           
on your detail,                 

1473
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:43,598
that's a good thing to do.      

1474
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,566
The only thing to be            
careful there though is         

1475
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,269
now your detail in not          
a graph view controller.        

1476
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,638
Your detail is now              
a navigation controller.        

1477
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,540
So if you wanna get the graph   
view controller and             

1478
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,342
like talk to it,                
tell it what to graph or        

1479
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,911
something like that,            
you need to get the root view   

1480
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,580
controller of                   
the navigation controller.      

1481
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,549
So it's just subtle             
difference but                  

1482
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,685
if you wrap your detail in      
a navigation controller,        

1483
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,853
the detail has come become      
a navigation controller.        

1484
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,588
It's easy to get to             
the graph view controller,      

1485
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,724
cuz the root view controller    
of the navigation controller.   

1486
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:15,096
That's how you wire             
up the split views so           

1487
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:17,298
that it works cross platform,   
all devices.                    

1488
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:21,302
The last thing we're gonna      
talk about is segueing.         

1489
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,406
So we know how to wire up       
the split view controller, and  

1490
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,974
we know how to do               
a navigation control,           

1491
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,376
we just embed it in             
the navigation controller.      

1492
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,346
I didn't talk about the tab     
bar controller by the way,      

1493
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,446
but that's easy.                

1494
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,450
You just drag a tab bar         
controller out and CTRL + drag  

1495
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,152
to all of the MVC's that        
you want it to show,            

1496
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:42,223
and you can actually even       
drag the little icons around    

1497
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,724
to put them in order.           

1498
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,227
You can even set the icons in   
text in the interface builder   

1499
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:46,961
with an inspector.              

1500
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,797
So, tab bars, so simple I       
don't even want to waste time   

1501
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,633
showing it, but so we know how  
to kind of hook up and control  

1502
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:56,971
drags and wire up, or embed to  
do the navigation controllers.  

1503
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,540
How do we go from one to the    
other, like in the navigation   

1504
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:02,109
controller, how do we go from   
all settings to settings and    

1505
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,244
from settings to                
accessibility,                  

1506
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:07,081
and accessibility               
to larger text?                 

1507
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,651
How do we set up that           
transition or how do we make    

1508
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,354
it so that we press a button    
in our calculator split view    

1509
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,557
and it causes that graph to     
be replaced with a new graph?   

1510
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,157
How do we do that?              

1511
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,226
We do that with what            
are called segues.              

1512
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,628
I've alluded to this earlier.   

1513
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,832
These are the kinds             
of segues that exist.           

1514
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,066
There's a show segue.           

1515
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,436
That means, if you're in        
a Navigation Controller,        

1516
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,537
slide a card on.                

1517
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,740
There's Show Detail,            

1518
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,208
which if you're                 
a Navigation Controller,        

1519
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,044
still means slide a card on.    

1520
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,578
But if you're inside            
a Split View,                   

1521
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,982
it means put this new MVC       
where the detail goes.          

1522
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:42,683
That's why it's                 
called Show Detail.             

1523
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,552
So Show Detail behaves          
differently depending on        

1524
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,653
whether you're in               
the Split View or               

1525
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:48,122
whether you're in               
a Navigation Controller.        

1526
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,591
Modal segue,                    
it's kind of interesting one.   

1527
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,227
It takes over the entire        
screen and lets                 

1528
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:57,831
the MVC that you're segueing    
into own the whole screen.      

1529
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,034
Now, these can be somewhat      
disturbing to the users cuz,    

1530
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,869
I can't get back                
to where I was,                 

1531
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,804
cuz there's no back button or   
anything.                       

1532
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,239
That whatever MVC comes up and  

1533
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,775
takes over the screen has to    
provide some UI to get out of   

1534
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,945
there like cancel or            
done, or something.             

1535
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,915
So we try to stay away          
from Modal if we can.           

1536
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,019
So Popover is sort of           
the same as Modal, but          

1537
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,621
instead of taking over the      
whole screen, it just puts up   

1538
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,656
a little pop-up window,         
a little popover window,        

1539
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,958
you've seen that,               
on iPad especially.             

1540
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:28,229
It's still Modal, because       
if you click anywhere else,     

1541
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,797
the popover goes away.          

1542
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,233
So it's essentially modal.      

1543
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:33,634
It's a little nicer             
than modal, though,             

1544
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,737
because you can really see the  
background kinda grayed out.    

1545
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,772
And if you don't want           
what's in the popover,          

1546
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,541
just click somewhere else and   
it goes away.                   

1547
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,076
So yeah, popover's              
a little nicer than modal.      

1548
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,078
But it only works on            
fairly large screens,           

1549
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,247
unless you have a really        
small pop over window.          

1550
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,319
Now, I'm going                  
to emphasize for                

1551
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,421
the second time what I said     
before segues always create     

1552
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,824
a new instance of the MVC.      

1553
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:00,695
All of the segues, all of       
them, modal, popover, show,     

1554
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:01,495
slide in the min,               

1555
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,265
show detail, even show          
detail in the split view.       

1556
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,635
If you have a calculator and    
you say graph my function and   

1557
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,470
you segue to a graph            
view controller,                

1558
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,372
it throws away the one          
that was there and              

1559
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:14,908
puts a new one there,           
always creating new MVCs.       

1560
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:18,379
So think of these MVCs as       
ephemeral, they come alive,     

1561
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,280
they do their job and           
they go away.                   

1562
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,784
They don't live you know,       
long lives.                     

1563
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,686
Now the master and              
a split view.                   

1564
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,121
The root view of                
a navigational,                 

1565
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,823
they tend to live fairly long.  

1566
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,526
But even those, if that split   
view, if that navigational      

1567
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,428
were to go off screen,          
they go away as well.           

1568
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,398
So how do we make               
these segues happen?            

1569
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,233
Of course,                      
we use control drag.            

1570
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,569
We love to use control drag,    
so here for                     

1571
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,404
example is                      
the calculator example.         

1572
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:44,672
I've got a split view.          

1573
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,874
And in my calculator            
there in the upper right        

1574
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,477
I have a button it's            
very hard to see but            

1575
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,111
it's a little                   
picture of a graph.             

1576
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,813
So that's the button            
that when I press it,           

1577
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:55,549
it's gonna take whatever's in   
my calculator and graph it.     

1578
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,019
So if I've typed in for         
example m cosine,               

1579
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:04,258
it's gonna draw a cosine wave,  
that's what that button does.   

1580
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,661
So I just go into interface     
builder here, control drag      

1581
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,564
from that button down to        
the detail right there.         

1582
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:11,532
When I let go,                  

1583
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,634
it's going to put up just       
a little black window,          

1584
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,502
which I'll show you             
a little detail of.             

1585
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,003
It looks like that.             

1586
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,106
And I'm gonna pick              
the segue I want.               

1587
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:21,675
Well, since this is             
a Split view, if I can,         

1588
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,177
I'm going to show detail.       

1589
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,079
Put it on the right             
side of the split view.         

1590
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,348
Now, if I were in this          
same storyboard, but            

1591
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,583
I was on an iPhone non-plus,    

1592
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,251
then even though I'm            
picking show detail here,       

1593
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,754
it's still going to do the      
navigation controller show,     

1594
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,291
because there is no split view  
side, when I'm on the iPhone.   

1595
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,894
So I pick the segue             
type I want, and                

1596
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,229
it creates the segue.           

1597
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,564
And it appears in               
your storyboard,                

1598
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,232
it can even be clicked on and   
inspected.                      

1599
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,467
And in fact you're gonna        
always want to click on         

1600
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,170
that thing and inspect it.      

1601
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:52,173
Cuz you don't wanna set         
this thing right here which     

1602
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:53,841
is the identifier.              

1603
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,677
Every segue has an identifier,  
it's just the string and        

1604
01:11:56,745 --> 01:12:00,013
that identifier is what's       
you're gonna use in your code   

1605
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,649
to talk about this segue.       

1606
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:04,252
And I'll talk                   
about what you've               

1607
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,120
been talk about regarding       
segues, any moment here.        

1608
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,389
So always set that.             

1609
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,223
And you wanna set it,           

1610
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,059
the identifier to be something  
that kind of says what is       

1611
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:12,660
segue does.                     

1612
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,995
So in this case it              
shows a graph, so               

1613
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,764
I call this show graph.         

1614
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:22,236
That's how you set              
up your segue.                  

1615
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,204
And that's true for             
navigation controller as well.  

1616
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,673
If you have a navigation        
controller and                  

1617
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:28,209
you have a button that causes   
another card to slide on you    

1618
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:30,445
just control drag from that     
button to the other MVC.        

1619
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,915
And then you use a show segue,  
and it'll just work.            

1620
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,049
Has to be all inside,           

1621
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,751
embedded in navigation          
controller, of course.          

1622
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,720
So what can you do              
with these identifiers?         

1623
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:42,457
It is actually possible to      
cause a segue to happen from    

1624
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,425
code, with performSegue         
withIdentifier, but             

1625
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,961
I'm not gonna talk about that,  
cuz we're never gonna do that.  

1626
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,329
We always gonna have buttons,   

1627
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,764
well I'm not gonna say          
we're never gonna do that,      

1628
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,767
but we won't be doing that      
in your assignment three,       

1629
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:53,267
that's for sure.                

1630
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:54,301
It's pretty rare.               

1631
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,303
But you can do it               
with performSegue.              

1632
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,006
But the more important use of   
the identifier is not causing   

1633
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:00,774
segues to happen cuz            
segues kinda happen             

1634
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,643
automatically when              
the buttons are pressed.        

1635
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,645
It's to prepare for a segue.    

1636
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,148
This is the most important      
method in all of                

1637
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,552
multiple MVC programming        
is this preparing for segue     

1638
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,489
method which I'm gonna show     
you in a moment here, okay.     

1639
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,058
And remember, we're all         
segueing to a new MVC           

1640
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,227
freshly created, so             
it's always raw.                

1641
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:22,830
So we have to prepare it to     
do what it's going to do.       

1642
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:25,466
Here is the method.             

1643
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,334
It's called prepare for         
segue, and                      

1644
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,972
it also has a sender            
argument right there.           

1645
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,375
The segue that's passed         
along that first argument       

1646
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:37,611
is just a little container      
that contains interesting       

1647
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,613
information about the segue.    

1648
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,049
For example,                    
the identifier, Show Graph.     

1649
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,187
And very importantly, the       
controller that you're seguing  

1650
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,455
too, because the whole          
point is here,                  

1651
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,292
you're suppose to be preparing  
this MVC that's going to        

1652
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,593
come on screen.                 

1653
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:53,794
To do its job so                

1654
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,431
you get that thing from         
this little segue object.       

1655
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,301
The sender is kinda             
like buttons,                   

1656
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,636
the button sender when          
we had the action there.        

1657
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:05,505
It's just what object           
is instigating this.            

1658
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,108
So in the calculator example    
you're gonna have a button      

1659
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,044
clicking causing this segue,    
it's gonna be that button.      

1660
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,646
Okay, the button that's         
causing the segue.              

1661
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:16,884
But it's Any because anything,  
when we saw the example         

1662
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,220
of the all settings, we were    
clicking on table view cells    

1663
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,257
there not buttons but cells in  
what's called a table view,     

1664
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,692
which we're gonna talk          
about week after next.          

1665
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,561
And so                          
that could be the sender.       

1666
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,364
Or you might have done perform  
segue on the previous slide,    

1667
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:32,066
that actually let you           
set the sender so               

1668
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,769
you've tell it anything you     
want, it could be nil also.     

1669
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:36,971
We don't use it that much.      

1670
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,774
The first thing I'm             

1671
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,242
do is going to be               
get the identifier.             

1672
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,477
Note that it can be nil so      

1673
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:47,447
I'm gonna say if let to get it  
out of that segue right there.  

1674
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,950
And I need that identifier cuz  
I need to know which segue I'm  

1675
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,486
doing because I might           
have three buttons              

1676
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,355
on my calculator that segued    
to three different things.      

1677
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,424
Now you're not gonna have in    
assignment three but you could  

1678
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,192
have multiple buttons           
segueing to different things.   

1679
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,062
So you need to know which       
segue you're talking about.     

1680
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,032
So you switch on it and         
then you check the case.        

1681
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,301
And in the case of Show Graph,  

1682
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,204
which is the one we're          
gonna do right here,            

1683
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:16,010
we're going to prepare that     
graphing MVC to do its job.     

1684
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:20,314
Now, in order to talk           
to that graphing MVC,           

1685
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,983
we have to get it as            
a graph controller.             

1686
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,653
Now the type of that            
destination view controller     

1687
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:29,623
that's in the segue object      
is just UIViewController,       

1688
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,626
it doesn't know that it's       
a graph view controller or      

1689
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,262
something like that it's        
just UIViewController.          

1690
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,064
So we have to use as,           

1691
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:40,734
remember the "as?" I told       
you you could cast anything.    

1692
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:44,438
Not just any object, you can    
cast a UIViewController to try  

1693
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:47,007
and down cast it to             
a specific view controller.     

1694
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,910
So here I'm going to try and    
cast the destination view       

1695
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,445
controller to be                
a graph controller.             

1696
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,014
I'm gonna assume the graph      
controller is the type of       

1697
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,884
the controller                  
of my graph MVC.                

1698
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,819
And if I'm able to do that,     
which I should be,              

1699
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,555
because I know this is          
the show graph segue, so        

1700
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,224
I better be, if,                

1701
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,959
if I'm not then probably I      
wanna raise an exception here.  

1702
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,961
Because I'm really expecting    
to be able to do it.            

1703
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,364
Maybe I use as exclamation      
point right there instead of    

1704
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:14,101
as question mark as it'd be     
bad if I was doing this and     

1705
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,836
it wasn't actually              
graphcontroller.                

1706
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,505
But anyway,                     
I get the graphcontroller so    

1707
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:22,409
now VC, this variable VC is     
of type graphcontroller, so     

1708
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:24,511
I can start setting             
vars in it,                     

1709
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,948
calling methods, whatever I     
need to do to prepare that      

1710
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:30,417
graph controller                
to do its job.                  

1711
01:16:30,486 --> 01:16:30,918
Now in the Calculator case,     

1712
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,954
what I'm doing is I'm           
going to somehow have to        

1713
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,390
set the model of                
the graph you control or        

1714
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:39,260
something to show               
the graph I want.               

1715
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,095
Based on what 's                
in my calculator.               

1716
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,130
So, I'm preparing it            
to do what it does.             

1717
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,033
I'm pretty much never going     
to talk to this thing again.    

1718
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,803
So I'm gonna give it all the    
information it needs to do to   

1719
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,572
go to a job.                    

1720
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,242
This is kind of one             
time set up and                 

1721
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,411
that's the way MVCs need to     
work through, object oriented.  

1722
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,580
They get set up once and then   
they just live on their own,    

1723
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:00,414
they do their own job.          

1724
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:03,384
They don't talk back to the     
person who brought them up or   

1725
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,585
to anyone else.                 

1726
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:05,453
They live on their own.         

1727
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,923
So you can do anything you      
want to here, to try to do it.  

1728
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,292
One thing to warn               
you here though and             

1729
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,295
half of you will                
trip over this.                 

1730
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,062
When you're doing               
this preparation                

1731
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,832
of that graph controller,       

1732
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:22,269
that graph controller's         
outlets have not been set.      

1733
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,840
I told you that IOS hooks up    
those outlets to really really  

1734
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,442
quickly, but this is one case   
where it doesn't quite hook     

1735
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:30,744
them up fast enough.            

1736
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,414
When you're doing               
vc.property1 = whatever,        

1737
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,651
vc.callMethodToSetItUp, at      
that time,                      

1738
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,953
none of vc's outlets are set.   

1739
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,588
So you can't do                 
anything in the UI.             

1740
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,058
So if you're collecting         
information for what to,        

1741
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:44,859
to do in the UI,                

1742
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,360
you're gonna have to store it   
in some vars or something.      

1743
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,496
And then later,                 
either in the did set           

1744
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:52,165
of those outlet centers, or     
I'm gonna teach you about view  

1745
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,701
controller life                 
cycle next week.                

1746
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,669
There's other methods           
that happen later,              

1747
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:58,438
that you can be sure            
that the outlets are set.       

1748
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,008
So this is in red, any time I   
put something with red inside,  

1749
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:02,342
you really wanna                
pay attention.                  

1750
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,778
So the outlets are not          
set in graph control or         

1751
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,715
when you're preparing,          
the process of preparing.       

1752
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,652
You can also prevent            
a segue from happening,         

1753
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,454
let's say if the calculator     
and you try to hit graph and    

1754
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,289
you're on the middle            
of a binary operation,          

1755
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,624
pending binary operation.       

1756
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,827
Well you can't graph that.      

1757
01:18:19,896 --> 01:18:21,895
There's no way to graph         
a pending binary operation.     

1758
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:24,631
Three times, what's             
the graph of three times?       

1759
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,532
It's nothing.                   

1760
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:27,001
So, you wanna prevent it.       

1761
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,202
So, in your assignment three    
you're gonna wanna use this     

1762
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,071
method and be able to control   
a shared perform segue,         

1763
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,639
you're gonna return false.      

1764
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,277
When you're in the middle of    
a pending operation, okay?      

1765
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,780
And so that's it for today.     

1766
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,381
There's no Friday               
section this week.              

1767
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:44,785
Next Friday section is going    
to be on performance analysis   

1768
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,453
cuz there's going to be         
an extra credit item            

1769
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,255
in assignment three             
that does that.                 

1770
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,923
You'll see that                 
when it goes out.               

1771
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:50,824
Next week I'm gonna do          

1772
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,892
a demo about all this           
multiple MVC stuff.             

1773
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,195
I'm gonna start talking about   
the View Controller Lifecycle.  

1774
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:57,564
And then the super important    
topic, Protocols and            

1775
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:02,436
Delegation.                     

1776
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,504
UI things like scroll           
views and table views.          

1777
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,341
We'll start that next week cuz  
all you're learning up till     

1778
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,275
now is kinda the basics.        

1779
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,811
Swift and views and             
multiple MVCs.                  

1780
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,946
One you got that basics in      
now you can start doing these   

1781
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,715
more powerful objects.          

1782
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:18,685
Now, assignment three is        
already on the class forums.    

1783
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,154
You can start it right now.     

1784
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,189
It's got really two             
major points to it.             

1785
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,759
One is a custom UI view         
that does graphing.             

1786
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:28,461
A truly a custom MVC            
that does graphing.             

1787
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,264
And that thing is completely    
independent of your             

1788
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,732
calculator.                     

1789
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,867
In fact I would recommend       
you create a new app            

1790
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,736
to create that MVC.             

1791
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:37,671
Because if you don't wanna be   
polluted by you calculator,     

1792
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,341
it's just a generic             
graphing MVC.                   

1793
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:41,275
Once you've got that,           

1794
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,710
you're gonna combine it         
with your calculator            

1795
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,444
like I'm talking about here,    

1796
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,013
where you're going to           
click a button, and             

1797
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:48,449
it's going to graph what's      
in your calculator.             

1798
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,517
So you can get started on that  
today because you already       

1799
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,319
know everything you need        
to know about UI view and       

1800
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,654
doing a custom draw method.     

1801
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:55,422
So you could start              
drawing your graph and          

1802
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,458
building that custom            
graphing view.                  

1803
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,360
You could even build            
the custom MVC because you're   

1804
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:03,230
building it as                  
a single MVC to start.          

1805
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,533
But you're gonna wanna          
wait til Monday to try and      

1806
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,334
hook it up to your              
calculator because you're       

1807
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:10,036
gonna wanna see me do           
the demo of a split view and    

1808
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,572
all that stuff and              
see that happening.             

1809
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,573
It'll help you when you         
start hooking your two          

1810
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,509
MVC's the graphing one and      
the calculator one together.    

1811
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,278
And because you                 
need next Monday                

1812
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:21,514
this assignment's not gonna     
be due until the next Monday.   

1813
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,385
Okay, so you got a nice 10 or   
11 days to get it done.         

1814
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:27,054
But I strongly recommend you    
use the next few days to go     

1815
01:20:27,123 --> 01:20:29,056
ahead and get started           
on the view part of it.         

1816
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,158
Because that's more than        
half of the assignment and      

1817
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,628
you can make a big              
head start into it.             

1818
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:36,563
The last thing is the last      
reading assignment              

1819
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,631
also went out today.            

1820
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,334
The due date is pretty          
much next Wednesday.            

1821
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,403
But that is going               
to make it so                   

1822
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,338
you've read the entire          
Swift document.                 

1823
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,107
So by the end of                
this assignment,                

1824
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,443
you should feel like you know   
everything that's in there.     

1825
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:51,145
Now of course, I don't          
expect you to know every        

1826
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:53,280
single detail about             
every single thing.             

1827
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,681
But I expect you                

1828
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,317
if you like want to do          
a nested function I expect you  

1829
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,152
to be able to know where to     
go look to find that out.       

1830
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,890
Or you wanna do                 
optional chaining and           

1831
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,592
you can't quite remember you    
know where to go look it up.    

1832
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:06,660
That's a reference document.    

1833
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,362
So you wanna know               
what's in there.                

1834
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,632
Even if you don't               
memorize at all.                

1835
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,699
That's it.                      

1836
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:14,201
See you next time.              

1837
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:24,878
