00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:15,414
Developing Applications for     
iOS, winter of 2017.            

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,318
This is Lecture number 7, and   
today we're going to talk       

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:23,688
a little bit more about Swift.  
And once we do that,            

6
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,159
we can introduce some           
technology that we need         

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,129
to do more sophisticated        
UIKit objects like,             

8
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,899
scroll views can be our first   
examples of that today's web    

9
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,603
demo at the end where we show   
you how to use scroll view.     

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,708
First thing I wanna talk about  
in Swift is error handling. So  

11
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:46,778
far, we have not called         
any methods that                

12
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:51,749
can generate an error, or what  
we call throwing an error. And  

13
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,020
we can always tell these        
methods though really clearly   

14
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,323
in any API.                     
Because when they're declared,  

15
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,059
they'll have the word           
throws after it. And            

16
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,329
throws means that somewhere in  
the processing of this method,  

17
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,866
it's possible, but not          
guaranteed, that it will throw  

18
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,803
an error. So when it            
throws that error at us,        

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:16,040
we have to catch the error.     
And the way we catch it is,     

20
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,677
well, first of all,             
every time we call a method     

21
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,813
that can throw an error, we     
have to use the word try. So    

22
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,949
we have to try that method      
because it might fail.          

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,152
So that's why we use            
the word try. But               

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,020
if we wanna catch               
the error that comes back,      

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,390
we actually have to do that     
little try inside what's        

26
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,729
called a do construct.          
So we have to say do{, and      

27
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:42,800
then some code that has some    
tries in it. And then} catch,   

28
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,338
then let error is going to      
allow us to grab the thrown     

29
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,242
error into a variable,          
in this case called error.      

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,311
We could say,                   
let any variable name we want.  

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,880
That's gonna be the variable    
that has the error in it.       

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,017
And then in that curly brace,   
we handle the error. And        

33
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,853
then after we've handled it,    
our code continues. So          

34
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,957
we caught the error, we deal    
with it, we keep going.         

35
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,760
It did, if we want to, and      
if our function throws,         

36
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,531
we could re-throw the error by  
using the keyword throw there,  

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,636
in our second, little curly     
brace space. Now this error     

38
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,439
that gets thrown to you, it     
does have to be of a certain    

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,744
type. The type is called        
error. It's a protocol,         

40
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,981
which I'm gonna talk about      
later in this lecture, but      

41
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,082
it's a pretty                   
simple little type.             

42
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,720
And in UIKit, when UIKit        
methods throw an error,         

43
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,889
they throw an error of          
this type NSError. So           

44
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,226
you can go take a look in the   
documentation for NSError and   

45
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,498
see what an NSError is. It has  
an error code, it has an error  

46
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,335
domain, like where              
the error occurred. And it,     

47
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:54,038
even has some things like a     
description of what happened,   

48
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,342
why it failed,                  
things like that.               

49
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,812
Now, sometimes we call          
a function that throws,         

50
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,383
and we know for sure it's       
not going to fail. This is      

51
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:10,155
rare that we know this, but     
if we're certain about it,      

52
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:14,926
we can use another version of   
try, which is try! And just     

53
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,630
like exclamation point means    
to force it in an optional,     

54
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,267
exclamation point here means    
to force it essentially.        

55
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,303
And if we call                  
context.save() right here,      

56
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,974
whatever that function is,      
if we call it and it throws,    

57
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,043
our app will crash, okay.       
That's what the try!            

58
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,913
means. It means try, I know     
this is not going to throw.     

59
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,217
If it does, crash my app.       
There's yet                     

60
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:44,189
another try though,             
which is try?. Try?             

61
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:48,994
means try to call this          
method that throws, and         

62
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,763
if it does throw,               
just give me back nil.          

63
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,665
Well, for                       

64
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,534
that to work of course,         
the variable that we're         

65
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,838
assigning the result of this    
method, I called this one,      

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,509
errorProneFunctionThatReturns-  
AnInt. Whatever that returns,   

67
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,145
it's now gonna return           
an optional version of that.    

68
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,247
So error prone function         
that returns an int,            

69
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,483
returns an int obviously.       
But x,                          

70
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:15,720
this let x =, that x is         
gonna be an optional int for    

71
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,589
obvious reasons because if      
error prone function return     

72
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:23,428
an int throws, it has to throw  
nil back at us, okay? So        

73
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:28,200
that's what try? is. Try?       
is give it a try, if it fails,  

74
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,169
just give me back nil. If I     
do this try, I don't get to     

75
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,271
look at the error.              
I don't know what it is.        

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,642
I'm ignoring the error here.    
I know there was an error, but  

77
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:42,213
that's all I know in the try?   
case. So it's a very simple     

78
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,049
error mechanism that            
works quite well.               

79
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,786
In Swift they really learned    
the lessons of some other       

80
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,891
languages that have more        
overwrought, over complicated   

81
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,728
throwing of errors that are     
throwing up call stacks and     

82
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,398
all these things, Swift         
is very straight forward,       

83
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,335
sees the entirety of the error  
processing, all right?          

84
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,572
Now, another completely         
different topic, extensions.    

85
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,109
So, an extension allows you     
to add a method or a var,       

86
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:16,180
even, to another class or       
structure enum, that you may    

87
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,750
not even have the code to,      
okay, it's called extension     

88
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,822
because it extends that class.  
So, here's a concrete example,  

89
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,524
I hope you understand why       
we might use an extension.      

90
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,360
Remember when we did            
our app last time and           

91
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,064
we went to our Storyboard and   
we wrapped the detail of        

92
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,267
the split view in               
a navigation controller and     

93
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,037
it broke our code.              
Right, it broke our code and    

94
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,572
prepare for segue because       
that code was looking for       

95
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,509
a Face View controller and it   
found a navigation controller   

96
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,745
instead. And the way we fix     
that is we just look to see if  

97
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,348
it was navigation controller    
first. And if it was, we look   

98
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,150
at the visible view controller  
of the navigation controller,   

99
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,654
now we have our Face View       
controller back again. Now,     

100
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:01,092
we could put that code into an  
extension of UIViewController   

101
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,228
by creating a new var,          
you can see it right here       

102
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,832
called contentViewController,   
we can call the new var         

103
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,701
anything we want, I like        
contentViewController cuz       

104
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,136
if it's a navigation            
controller, it's the content.   

105
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,338
If it's not a navigation        
controller, it's just self.     

106
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,606
It's the view                   
controller itself.              

107
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,744
It's its own content.           
And so I can add this, so       

108
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,448
I'm adding this var actually    
to UIViewController. So now     

109
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:28,085
UIViewController understands    
this var, it has this new var.  

110
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,022
Now I didn't subclass           
UIViewController to do it,      

111
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,291
I just extended                 
UIViewController. So            

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,961
you UIViewController and all    
subclasses of UIViewController  

113
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,298
will now have this var. And it  
makes that code that we had in  

114
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,867
prepare, which looks            
something like this,            

115
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,470
the green part is               
the same in both places.        

116
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,838
It changes that code            
with all that to                

117
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:53,278
just this simple line of code.  
The segue's destination,        

118
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:58,717
contentViewController as my     
MVC. I think that slide says    

119
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,985
destinationViewController-      
that should be                  

120
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:05,423
segue.destination.contentView-  
Controller there. So,           

121
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,893
it just cleans up our code and  
prepare for segue. But          

122
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,995
the extension that we           
have UIViewControllers,         

123
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,731
purely a UIViewController       
thing.                          

124
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,500
It has nothing to do with our   
emotions view controller,       

125
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,269
anything like that. We purely   
extended UIViewController to    

126
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:23,575
have new functionality. Now,    
extensions inside their code,   

127
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,644
they can refer to self.         
And when they refer to self,    

128
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,381
they mean the class they're     
in. And so in this case,        

129
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,549
the self means                  
the UIViewController that       

130
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,718
is executing this var           
which makes sense,              

131
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,989
right? There's some             
restrictions though with these  

132
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,960
extensions. So extensions       
are not a substitute for        

133
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,696
everything object oriented      
like subclassing and            

134
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,132
things like that. One thing is  
that you can't re-implement     

135
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,903
something that already is in    
there. So, you can't override   

136
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,707
or subclass with extensions.    
You can only add new things     

137
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,610
that aren't there. And in       
fact, if UIViewController were  

138
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,479
to have implemented this        
var contentViewController,      

139
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,181
its version would win-          
the extension with not win.     

140
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,751
In fact, it might even get      
an error when you try to add    

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,853
an extension to                 
something already there.        

142
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,621
So its not our replacing or     
overriding or                   

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,658
anything like that, it's for    
adding new things. And a huge   

144
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:18,763
restriction to extensions is    
they cannot have any storage.   

145
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:25,403
The only vars an extension can  
have have to be computed vars.  

146
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,705
They can't have any             
stored vars, okay,              

147
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,975
extensions have no storage.     
They are purely for             

148
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,880
adding code, all right. Now,    
this feature of extensions is   

149
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,450
easily abused especially        
by beginners to Swift.          

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,019
They start saying, cool,        
I'll just add this code and     

151
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,521
extension here,                 
I'll add new code and           

152
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,657
an extension there and          
I'll add it over there.         

153
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,359
And you start getting this      
kind of messy situation where   

154
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,194
the extensions don't            
really make sense for           

155
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,264
the class you added them to.    
So I'm gonna suggest that you   

156
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,134
be kind of go slow and          
steady with the extensions.     

157
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,904
Don't use them too much. Now    
having said that, extensions    

158
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:04,075
can be super powerful for       
architecting your code well.    

159
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,611
Okay, especially when I start   
talking about protocols.        

160
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,280
They can be a fundamental       
aspect of building              

161
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,350
like a functional programming   
approach to building your app.  

162
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,052
But I don't have time to        
teach all that to you. So       

163
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,088
you're only gonna know enough   

164
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,489
about extensions                
to get yourself in              

165
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,459
a little bit of trouble. So be  
careful with extensions, okay?  

166
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,695
Use them lightly. But           
in the future when you start    

167
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,631
a becoming serious iOS          
developer someday you're gonna  

168
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,966
wanna learn how and             
you can use extensions to your  

169
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:34,238
advantage without abusing       
them, all right? Next topic,    

170
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,910
protocols, super,               
duper important topic here.     

171
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,545
How many people have            
encountered protocols in        

172
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:46,384
other languages? Nobody, see?   
Well, one or two people.        

173
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,121
So it surprises me a little     
bit, but, protocols,            

174
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,325
while very simple, are also     
incredibly powerful. So,        

175
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:58,296
a protocol is a way             
to declare a type               

176
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:02,233
that really just means these    
methods and vars with no        

177
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:06,937
implementation generally.       
That's what a protocol is.      

178
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,742
A protocol, as you'll see, is   
a type. But you're essentially  

179
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,712
just defining a few methods.    
Or even some vars,              

180
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,982
that are part of this           
protocol. Then we're gonna use  

181
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,052
the protocol, as you'll see,    
to define our APIs better.      

182
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,557
It allows you to create an API  
that lets the callers pass      

183
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,628
anything they want- any class,  
or struct, or enum even,        

184
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,866
they want to this API that you  
create. But it allows you,      

185
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,970
who's receiving it,             
to ensure that that class, or   

186
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,405
enum, or struct,                
implements certain methods or   

187
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,176
vars that you need. So          
that's what this is all about.  

188
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,912
It's about API design.          
We want to build API so         

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,282
we can express in our API       
exactly what we want and        

190
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,318
no more. Okay, just the         
methods and vars we need to do  

191
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,288
whatever this function is       
going to do or whatever, and    

192
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:01,292
not extra stuff. So, a          
protocol is just a collection   

193
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,062
of method and                   
property declarations.          

194
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,798
That's what a protocol is.      
But a protocol is a type. It's  

195
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,202
a full fledged type. It serves  
any place you can use a type,   

196
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:15,506
like a float. You can use       
a type that's a protocol.       

197
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,243
Protocols are first-class       
types. Absolutely first-class   

198
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:23,781
types. The implementation of    
the methods and vars under      

199
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,851
protocol, since a protocol is   
just the declaration of them,   

200
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,554
where does the implementation   
happen? Well, mostly            

201
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,557
it happens in classes and       
structs and enum that claim to  

202
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,827
implement that protocol, or     
conform to that protocol,       

203
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,897
we say. So if I'm a struct,     
and I wanna say yes,            

204
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,467
I wanna conform to protocol x,  
then I have to implement        

205
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,938
all the methods in vars that    
are in protocol x, right?       

206
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,672
Cuz protocol x is just          
a declaration of them,          

207
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,708
it's not an implementation.     
Now,                            

208
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,778
you can also do implementation  
on a protocol in an extension,  

209
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,714
but I'm going to put that       
on the shelf for second and     

210
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,016
talk about that in              
a few more slides. But          

211
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,353
primarily protocols,            
implementation happens in       

212
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,155
conforming or                   
implementing classes,           

213
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,127
structs and enums. Now,         
the three parts to a protocol.  

214
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,029
One is the declaration          
of the protocol.                

215
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,332
That's really simple. It looks  
just like declaring a class,    

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,868
a struct or an enum.            
But there's no implementation,  

217
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,271
okay. The second part is        
the class or structure or       

218
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,608
enum that claims to             
conform to that protocol.       

219
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,943
That claims that it             
implements that protocol. And   

220
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,646
then of course there's the      
actual code that that class,    

221
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,883
struct, or enum, that claims    
to implement the protocol,      

222
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,785
actually does implement         
the protocol. So that's it,     

223
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,819
those are the three part        
of using a protocol.            

224
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,458
Both the declaration and        
then the implementation. Now,   

225
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,994
I'm gonna talk about            
a feature with protocols,       

226
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,563
called optional methods.        
This is not optional,           

227
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,966
like the optional type.         
This is different optional.     

228
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,502
It means that the methods in    
the protocol, are optional,     

229
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,071
you don't have to               
implement them, and             

230
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,906
you can still say that you      
implement this protocol.        

231
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,910
Now this is an Objective-C      
thing. This is not a really     

232
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,946
a Swift thing. In swift when    
you have a protocol and         

233
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,315
it has a bunch of methods       
in it, if you're struct or      

234
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,784
class and you wanna say you     
implemented that protocol,      

235
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,287
you have to implement           
all of them,                    

236
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,925
all right. In Objective-C       
though that's not true,         

237
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,827
in Objective-C some of the      
methods might be optional and   

238
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,164
in which case you can claim     
to implement the protocol and   

239
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,868
not implement those. So, if we  
have a protocol that has these  

240
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,437
optional things in it,          
it has to be marked objc.       

241
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,408
So you put this little @objc    
before the word protocol, and   

242
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,743
that says this is               
an Objective-C protocol. And    

243
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,346
then inside the declaration     
you can put the word            

244
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,283
"optional" in front of any      
funcs or var that you want to   

245
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:44,154
make optional. So this is       
going to be used for something  

246
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,090
called delegation which I'm     
gonna talk about in a few       

247
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,860
slides which is an Objective-C  
thing that is brought forward.  

248
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,931
Because it's in UIKit so        
extensively it's brought        

249
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,334
forward into Swift using        
this @objc protocol, okay?      

250
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,971
But back to protocols in        
general. So let's take a look   

251
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,705
at what a protocol              
looks like to declare.          

252
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,710
So here's the declaration of a  
protocol called SomeProtocol.   

253
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,612
And you can see it looks        
just like declaring a class,    

254
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,279
a struct, or an enum, right.    

255
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,582
You got the keyword which is    
protocol instead of class,      

256
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,551
struct, or enum.                
Then you got the name.          

257
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,991
Now after that though there's   
a colon, and other protocols.   

258
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,227
These protocols are called      
inherited protocols.            

259
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,331
Some protocol inherits          
these two protocols. And        

260
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,532
what it means is that anyone    
who wants to say yeah,          

261
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,800
I implement some protocol,      

262
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,235
they have to                    
implement those too.            

263
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,704
Okay, they're doing all         
three of these protocols.       

264
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,074
Some protocol, and              
its two inherited protocols.    

265
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,879
So protocols essentially have   
multiple inheritance. How many  

266
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,482
people know what multiple       
inheritance is in object        

267
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,785
oriented? So only a few of      
you. So multiple inheritance    

268
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,753
just means like you could       
have two super classes, or      

269
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,923
three super classes.            
Some languages support that.    

270
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,460
Swift does not. But             
Swift does support multiple     

271
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,764
protocols that you can          
inherit from, okay?             

272
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,768
Now, the protocol inside,       
you can have properties and     

273
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,440
you can have funcs. And         
if you have a var, a property,  

274
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,376
you have to say whether         
it's a get set property or      

275
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,112
there's just get only and you   
do that in a curly brace get    

276
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,582
set. Curly brace get.           
So you have to put that curly   

277
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,752
brace something in there that   
says whether you're gonna be    

278
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:27,224
a get set var or whether        
you're just a get-only var.     

279
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:32,496
Any function that the protocol  
expects would mutate the thing  

280
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,966
implementing it, like if        
a struct were implementing it,  

281
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,904
you have to mark it mutating.   
Now if a class were to          

282
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,905
implement this protocol,        
it wouldn't matter,             

283
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,775
classes don't have to           
mark themselves mutating.       

284
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,877
And in fact it's even           
possible to say,                

285
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,847
I want this protocol only to    
be implemented by classes.      

286
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,583
And you do that by putting      
the word class right after      

287
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,719
the colon. See the yellow       
class right there SomeProtocol  

288
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,256
: class- that means this        
SomeProtocol can only be        

289
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,756
implemented by                  
reference types. And            

290
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,426
in that case you don't have to  
put any mutatin's in there.     

291
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,428
But if you are gonna            
allow your protocol to          

292
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,097
be implemented by an enum,      
or especially by a struct,      

293
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,934
obviously you're gonna have     
to put mutating in there.       

294
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,973
You can also specify in         
a protocol initializers.        

295
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:16,940
You're basically saying,        

296
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,410
anyone who wants to implement   
this SomeProtocol has to be be  

297
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,814
able to be initialized with     
these arguments, all right?     

298
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,451
If you do that, by the way,     
and you're a class,             

299
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,456
okay, then you have to mark     
the initializer required. I'll  

300
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:37,895
show you that in a second. All  
right, so how does a class or   

301
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:42,733
a struct or an enum say yes,    
I implement SomeProtocol?       

302
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:46,336
It does it this way. A class,   
right after its superclass,     

303
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,639
just puts a comma and           
the protocols'll do this.       

304
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,208
And you can implement any       
number of protocols there.      

305
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,244
So this class called            
SomeClass has a SuperClass,     

306
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,247
it's called SuperClass of some  
class, and it also implements   

307
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,984
two protocols, SomeProtocol     
and AnotherProtocol.            

308
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,721
Now inside of SomeClass'        
implementations it must         

309
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,357
implement all the methods and   
vars in those two protocols     

310
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,027
unless it's an Objective-C      
protocol and they're marked     

311
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,163
optional. Okay, the methods     
in there are marked optional.   

312
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,600
That's the only exception to    
that. All right. Structs or     

313
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,937
enums. Exactly the same, it's   
just they have no superclass.   

314
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,439
So here's an enum saying,       
that it implements those two    

315
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,975
protocols, okay? And here       
is a struct saying that it      

316
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,678
implements those                
two protocols. Now,             

317
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:32,482
you can have any number of      
protocols implemented. And      

318
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,420
as I said, inits have to be     
required. The reason that       

319
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,322
these inits have to be          
required here is that,          

320
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,159
what if a subclass, subclass    
is SomeClass right there, and   

321
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,095
it does all the initial         
exation games such as,          

322
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,698
this is no longer               
a good intializer.              

323
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,665
Because maybe this              
was required.                   

324
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,468
You need an initializer,        
you need an override, so        

325
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,569
now you have your own new       
designated initializer,         

326
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,072
et cetera. Well, that would be  
bad, because that would mean    

327
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,075
the subclass of SomeClass       
would no longer conform to      

328
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,945
that protocol, and              
that is not allowed.            

329
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,981
If a class conforms to          
a protocol, like SomeProtocol,  

330
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,884
all of its subclasses have      
to continue to do that. And     

331
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:10,721
they'll inherit that from the   
superclass except for init,     

332
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,191
are the one thing that can be   
uninherited by the rules of     

333
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,563
init. Okay? One thing that's    
very interesting is that you    

334
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,499
are allowed to add protocol     
conformance to a struct,        

335
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,403
a class, or an enum using an    
extension. As long as you can   

336
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,539
do it without any storage. You  
can do it in the extension.     

337
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,443
You just say, extension         
Something, where Something is   

338
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,312
the class, struct or enum,      
colon, SomeProtocol.            

339
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,182
And that saying, I'm creating   
extension to that class,        

340
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,651
struct or enum that             
implements this protocol.       

341
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,918
And then inside                 
that extension,                 

342
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,790
you have to implement all the   
methods of the protocol. Okay,  

343
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:50,727
understand what I'm             
saying there? Let's             

344
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,198
talk about protocols being      
types. What do I mean when I    

345
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,867
say a protocol is a type?       
So, I got an example here.      

346
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,803
I've got a protocol             
called Moveable and             

347
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,439
it just has one function in     
it, a mutating function called  

348
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,144
move to point. Now, I have      
two data structures here.       

349
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,513
One is a class called Car,      
and it's Moveable.              

350
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,950
Okay, the Car is Moveable, but  
the Car also has other methods  

351
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,887
like changeOil. You change      
the oil of the car. And         

352
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,056
similarly I have this           
struct called Shape.            

353
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,259
It also implements Moveabl.     
Look, see, mutating func        

354
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,861
move to point. It actually      
implements that. But it also    

355
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,931
has a function called draw.     
Because it is a shape and       

356
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,168
it can be drawn on screen.      
All right, so all               

357
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,539
two of these classes implement  
this protocol move to.          

358
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:39,343
Do you see that? So do you see  
that they're all moveable?      

359
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,612
Okay, a car is moveable.        
A shape is moveable.            

360
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,583
That's how we would describe    
those. So I created two little  

361
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,785
vars down here. A Prius,        
which is of car of course,      

362
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,322
it equals a new car.            
And then I created a square,    

363
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,991
which is a shape, of course.    
So I've got a Prius and         

364
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,360
a square here. Let's see what   
we can do with the Prius and    

365
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,497
the square. First, I can        
create a var whose type is      

366
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:05,936
Moveable called thingToMove     
and I can assign it to Prius.   

367
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,573
Because a Prius is moveable.    
So if I have a var that         

368
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,776
is of type moveable, of course  
a Prius can be put in there.    

369
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:17,681
Everyone understand that? And   
I can even say, thingToMove,    

370
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,218
move to this point, because     
thingToMove is a Moveable.      

371
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,622
So, if it's a Moveable, it has  
to implement move to point. So  

372
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,092
I can say that. However,        
I cannot say, thingToMove,      

373
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,929
change oil. This is the         
critical thing to understand,   

374
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:39,636
okay? Even though I put         
a Prius in thingToMove,         

375
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,741
that var is not a Car,          
it's a Moveable.                

376
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,211
And moveables don't know how    
to change the oil. Cars do.     

377
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,748
But moveables don't. So what    
matters is the type when it     

378
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,652
comes to sending the messages,  
not what's actually in there.   

379
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,923
Everyone understand that? Now,  
of course, I could also say     

380
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,759
thingToMove = square. That's    
perfectly legal as well. Okay,  

381
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,062
square is not even a class,     
it's a struct. Okay,            

382
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,031
it's not a car, it's a shape.   
But they're both moveable so    

383
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,601
that var thingToMove which      
is of type Moveable can hold    

384
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,303
either of those things.         
In fact, I can even create      

385
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:18,376
an array, thingsToMove, which   
is an array of Moveable and     

386
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,244
then I can put a Prius and      
a square both in there,         

387
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,980
even though they're             
completely different classes,   

388
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,781
types of things.                

389
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,517
They can both go in there       
cuz they're both moveables.     

390
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,520
So, the type of thing in        
that array is Moveable.         

391
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,091
What it actually is,            
doesn't matter. Okay,           

392
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,061
everyone cool with that?        
All right, I could also have    

393
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,964
a function that takes           
a Moveable as an argument,      

394
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,801
like slide that takes a slider  
which is a Moveable, and        

395
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,271
I can say, slider move to that  
position because the argument,  

396
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,174
slider, is a Moveable so        
we can say move too. And        

397
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:55,012
I could say slide a Prius,      
slide a square.                 

398
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,816
It works perfectly fine. By     
the way you can have arguments  

399
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,419
to functions that require       
multiple protocols.             

400
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,320
For example I could have        
a function, slip and            

401
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:08,159
slide which has a parameter     
x which is both Moveable,       

402
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,160
and another protocol,           
which I haven't showed here,    

403
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,563
called Slippery. And that's     
what the ampersand means.       

404
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,932
It means both of                
these protocols. So             

405
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,968
that inside slipAndSlide, I     
could send x Moveable things,   

406
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,070
like move to, and I could       
also send it Slippery things,   

407
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,841
whatever those are. Note that   
I can't say slipAndSlide        

408
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,711
Prius, because Prius does not   
implement slippery, okay?       

409
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,548
Prius does not conform to the   
Slippery protocol so cannot     

410
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:35,352
pass in there, Swift would      
not even let me call that.      

411
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,887
Okay, everyone understand what  
I mean now by a protocol as     

412
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,225
a type? It's just a type, and   
anything that conforms to that  

413
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,927
type can be stored in           
something, or passed through    

414
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:47,330
in something of that type. Now  
I'm gonna take a couple slides  

415
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,368
here and talk about the         
advanced use of protocols. I'm  

416
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,771
not gonna ask you to do that    
in the nine or ten weeks we     

417
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,874
have here because it is kinda   
advanced use. But I think it's  

418
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,944
important that you understand   
that this exists because all    

419
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:05,015
of Swift's standard library,    
arrays and dictionaries,        

420
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,886
all that stuff, is all          
implemented using protocols.    

421
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,124
So, one thing that a protocol   
can do that I'm not gonna ask   

422
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,126
you to do, is that it           
can restrict the type           

423
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,129
of a generic. Everyone knows    
what a generic is, right?       

424
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,832
An array of angle bracket t.    

425
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:26,237
It means the array can hold     
any type in there. But that t,  

426
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,206
that array of t could be        
restricted to things that       

427
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,641
implement a certain protocol.   
So here's an example,           

428
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,580
which is range. When I showed   
you range, a few lectures ago.  

429
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:41,385
I said it was sort              
of Range<T>. Okay,              

430
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:46,090
the reason it was only sort     
of Range<T> was because         

431
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,693
actually range bound or T       
bound is just a variable name   

432
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,862
basically for that type,        
colon comparable.               

433
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,067
Okay, so a range can only be a  
range of things that implement  

434
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:00,971
the protocol Comparable.        
Luckily ints implement          

435
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,809
Comparable. Floats implement    
Comparable. Characters and      

436
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:08,612
strings implement Comparable,   
etc. So these things all        

437
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,981
implement Comparable so         
you can have a range of ints,   

438
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,616
a range of floats,              
whatever. Now,                  

439
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,921
why does range want the thing   
in its range to be comparable?  

440
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,590
Well it's because it wants to   
make sure that its lower bound  

441
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,259
is always less than             
its upper bound.                

442
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,529
I think on the other slide,     
I said it was start index and   

443
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,698
end index. Which is actually    
not range, the range struct,    

444
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,935
that's countable range, and     
those kind of things have       

445
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:36,540
that. You rarely use            
just a straight range.          

446
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,241
You're almost always using      
the countable range,            

447
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,645
or closed countable range, or   
one of those. But anyway, so    

448
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:45,081
that's why it wants the type    
that it can be generic for      

449
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,717
to be Comparable. So            

450
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:50,220
being able to restrict this     
generic types by some protocol  

451
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:54,558
is really super powerful.       
Okay, because it allows you to  

452
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:59,362
build much a more wide variety  
of generic data structures.     

453
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,297
Because you can make it so      

454
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,833
that they have to implement     
certain things to work.         

455
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:07,538
All right. Now,                 
also, you can use               

456
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,875
generics to declare protocols.  
So you can have protocols,      

457
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:16,947
where the methods in vars       
might be a generic type. So,    

458
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,849
now you can have these          
protocols kind of meta.         

459
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,919
But you can have these          
protocols that can be           

460
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,056
describing behavior that        
can work on generic types.      

461
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,625
Or maybe work on generic        
types that implement certain    

462
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,496
protocols. Now, this is         
probably hard for you to        

463
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,899
imagine where this could go,    
but it really can go.           

464
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,036
Okay, so you're really opening  
up a lot of power here          

465
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,973
by adding generics. And         
constraining these generics     

466
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:47,144
using protocols.                
Again remember that you kind    

467
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,913
of get multiple inheritance     
with protocols. And I'm         

468
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,948
going to show you an example    
here with CountableRange.       

469
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,852
So CountableRange is the type   
of struct you get if you use    

470
00:25:55,921 --> 00:26:00,490
3..<5. Remember I showed you    
that. Like if you're doing a 4  

471
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,226
in and you want to come         
forward to 5 non inclusive,     

472
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,862
use three dot dot five you      
get this countable range.       

473
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,365
Well, le's think what           
CountableRange is.              

474
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,434
CountableRange is a struct      
that implements a ton           

475
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,070
of protocols.                   

476
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,771
Here's some of the interesting  
ones it implements.             

477
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,142
IndexableBase which gives it    
start start index and end       

478
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,012
index which I showed you on     
that slide kind of erroneously  

479
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,416
as Range, it also implements    
this method index               

480
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,019
after. So, a range can move     
forward cuz you can always      

481
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,955
find the next index.            
And it also does subscripting,  

482
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,459
so you can take a range and     
get subscript sub three, and    

483
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,795
it will get you the fourth      
one in there. Right,            

484
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,331
so that protocol's called       
IndexableBase. Then there's     

485
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,400
another protocol called         
Indexable. Which actually       

486
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:48,505
inherits from IndexableBase     
which has index offsetBy.       

487
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,274
So now you can move through     
the range more than just to     

488
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,944
the next one,                   
you can move farther ahead.     

489
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,780
There's also                    
BidirectionalIndexable.         

490
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,584
Now you can go backwards,       
index before, okay. So          

491
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,253
these things like startIndex,   
index after, index offset,      

492
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,789
index before, these are just    
methods in these protocols.     

493
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,527
It also implements this very    
important protocol called       

494
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:14,798
Sequence. And the main method   
in Sequence is makeIterator.    

495
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:18,068
Which gives back an object      
that can do the for in thing.   

496
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,837
So a Range, that's why          
Range works with for in,        

497
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,274
because it implements           
the Sequence protocol. And      

498
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,210
it also implements              
the Collection protocol.        

499
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,912
But Collection is primarily     
just an indexable sequence.     

500
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,381
So it implements both those     
protocols- things that          

501
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,250
are collections implement       
both those protocols.           

502
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,154
So why does Apple go            
to all the trouble              

503
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,523
to take something simple        
like a CountableRange and       

504
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:42,025
make it implement all of        
these ridiculous protocols?     

505
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:46,129
Well, here's why. Because       
Array also implements all       

506
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,799
those protocols and so          
there's Dictionary and Set and  

507
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,336
String.UTF16View. The thing     
that will let you see Unicode   

508
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,673
characters in the string. All   
of these things do. So they're  

509
00:27:56,742 --> 00:28:01,278
all sharing the same basic API  
description of their behavior.  

510
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,645
Even though they're             
quite different.                

511
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,582
An array is quite different     
from a range. A set             

512
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,052
is different than an array.     
And certainly a, character,     

513
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,322
UTF16View, is different         
than any of those things.       

514
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,224
They're dictionaries. So these  
are all different things.       

515
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,994
But they share the behavior     
of being indexable,             

516
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,362
being a sequence of things,     
being collections of things,    

517
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,630
they share all that behavior.   

518
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,101
And so that's described with    
these protocols and wait,       

519
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,204
there's more. Because of        
this thing I told you that      

520
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,773
extensions can be used to       
add code to a protocol,         

521
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,343
okay. Now there's restriction   
there, of course, because both  

522
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,746
protocols and extensions        
can have no storage.            

523
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,281
So if you extend                
a protocol and                  

524
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,250
give it some actual             
implementation,                 

525
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,020
by implementing some of         
the methods in the protocol.    

526
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,790
You can only use other          
methods in the protocol. Or     

527
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,558
methods you inherit             
from other protocols,           

528
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,894
right?                          
You can't use any storage.      

529
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,362
All you can do is call          
other methods and vars. But     

530
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,231
you'd be surprised how much     
you can do when you do that.    

531
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,400
And what that                   
allows you to do,               

532
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,570
in this case, if you consider   
Sequence. I told you that       

533
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,739
Sequence mostly just makes      
you that makeIterator thing.    

534
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,076
So, you can for in through      
the string characters or        

535
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,147
through the array or through    
the range or whatever. Well,    

536
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,817
if you just implement that one  
method, Apple has provided      

537
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:17,253
an extension to the Sequence    
protocol. That implements two   

538
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,889
dozen other methods that are    
based on being able to iterate  

539
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:24,494
through. Like contains, is      
this thing contained in this    

540
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:28,197
Sequence? Or joined by          
separator, which will take      

541
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,301
each thing in the sequence,     
turn it into a string, and      

542
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,070
join it by whatever separator   
you say, like a comma, and      

543
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,507
give you back a string.         
Okay? Or min and max.           

544
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,976
What's the minimum thing,       
or the maximum thing?           

545
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:40,743
Of course in that case,         

546
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,813
the sequence would have         
to have what, comparable        

547
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,217
items? You have to be able to   
compare them. If you're gonna   

548
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,954
do min or max. Even those       
cool functions I told you,      

549
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,991
filter and map, remember        
those? That took a closure and  

550
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,493
you were able to map an array   
from one thing to another.      

551
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,361
You can do the same             
thing with a range. And         

552
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,798
that code is not in Array.      
It's in this extension of       

553
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:07,137
Sequence. Okay, so              
now you're actually inheriting  

554
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,140
true implementation,            
true functionality. And         

555
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,410
you're multiply inheriting it,  
okay? And                       

556
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,445
you're doing it in              
a generic way so                

557
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,815
that the code works on arrays,  
string characters, etc.,        

558
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:23,020
equally. Okay, so hopefully,    
that's given you some feel for  

559
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,356
like whoa, what you could do    
if you had these protocols?     

560
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,826
If you've designed your         
API using protocols.            

561
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,229
And then, you could add code    
like this using extensions.     

562
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,133
You can hopefully see, and use  
generics especially, you could  

563
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,471
see how you could reuse a lot   
of code. Now this approach, I   

564
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,142
actually mentioned it before.   
This approach of focusing on    

565
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,777
the behavior of things          
rather than on the storage.     

566
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:54,150
Is leading to a methodology     
called functional programming.  

567
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,786
And again, I can't teach        
you that unfortunately, but     

568
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,556
I want you to know it exists.   
And maybe you can take          

569
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,725
a course here where you         
can learn about it.             

570
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:05,128
If you go out to the outside    
world, self-teach               

571
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,365
yourself if you have to. It's   
very powerful mechanism for     

572
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,433
programming.                    
And the protocols and           

573
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,803
generics play right into this.  
Because protocols and generics  

574
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,240
are all about the behavior      
of things, not about their      

575
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:22,178
storage. Okay, all right.       
That's all I can unfortunately  

576
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,247
have time to say about          
the functional programming and  

577
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,750
protocols. And                  
now let's back way up off of    

578
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,851
advanced protocols and          

579
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
start talking about a couple    
of simple uses of protocols.    

580
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,923
Here's a simple protocol that   
you could use right now in      

581
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,194
your calculator. It's called    
CustomStringConvertible.        

582
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:41,064
And it only has one thing in    
the protocol which is a var.    

583
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,801
It's a get-only var called      
description. Looks familiar?    

584
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,005
Which is a string. And if       
you implement this protocol,    

585
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,707
then when you print,            
if you do the backslash,        

586
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:54,211
parenthesis thing and put your  
thing inside. It will call      

587
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,681
this description to get the     
description of it. So right     

588
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,518
now, if you said, print quote   
\ ( your CalculatorBrain,       

589
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,590
in your view controller, ), it  
would probably print out some   

590
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,959
hexadecimal number and the      
word CalculatorBrain, which is  

591
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,264
useless. But if you put colon   
CustomStringConvertible after   

592
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,134
your struct CalculatorBrain,    
now, when you print it out,     

593
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,337
it'll print out the             
description. In other words,    

594
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,541
the equation, right, because    
you implement description       

595
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,444
already. I intentionally chose  
the name description there      

596
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,979
so that you would implement     
CustomStringConvertible         

597
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,583
automatically. But you have to  
also say that you implement     

598
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,218
it. You can't just              
implement description and       

599
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,820
expect it to work. You have     
to say, yes, and I implement    

600
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,290
CustomStringConvertible by      
putting that on there.          

601
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,292
So give that a try.             
Go get your calculator and      

602
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,327
put this colon                  
CustomStringConvertible. And    

603
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,230
then, in your view controller   
somewhere, print out your       

604
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,834
CalculatorBrain with\().        
See what you get, all right?    

605
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:56,540
Another really simple use of    
protocols is delegation, okay?  

606
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,809
And it's really where we've     
all been leading up to here,    

607
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:03,713
in terms of a use case of       
protocols. This is not gonna    

608
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,048
use any of the other stuff I    
was talking about, generics or  

609
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,617
extensions, none of that,       
okay?                           

610
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:10,853
This is just the simplest       
possible use of protocols,      

611
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,555
although it does use            
Objective-C protocols           

612
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,925
because a lot of optional       
methods in these protocols.     

613
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,928
But this is how we're           
gonna implement this MVC        

614
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,531
thing we talked about,          
which is blind, structured      

615
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,901
communication. The delegate     
and the data source, remember   

616
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,371
that from lecture 2? This is    
how we're gonna implement it,   

617
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,307
we're gonna implement this      
with protocols. So here's how   

618
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,679
it plays out, to use protocols  
to do that delegation. First,   

619
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,416
UIView thing, okay, like        
a ScrollView, for example,      

620
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,353
or a TableView, which we'll     
talk about next week.           

621
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,423
It declares a protocol,         
which has all the will and      

622
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,759
should and did methods          
I was talking about.            

623
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,929
So I will scroll to here, or    
should I allow scrolling in     

624
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,999
this direction? Those kind      
of methods, it implements       

625
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,768
a protocol that just has        
those methods listed in it.     

626
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,770
It's gonna be                   
an Objective-C protocol,        

627
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,406
they're almost all gonna be     
optional, all right? So it      

628
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:07,877
just declares that protocol.    
Then the view adds public API   

629
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,615
to itself, which is a weak      
property called delegate or     

630
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:17,621
sometimes data source. And      
that type is that protocol,     

631
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,458
okay? So anything can be        
assigned to that var,           

632
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:27,197
as long as it implements that   
protocol. The view uses this    

633
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,932
delegate property in            
itself to get the answer,       

634
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,670
should I scroll here, and to    
tell people, I just did scroll  

635
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,540
here, okay? It sends those      
messages to the delegate,       

636
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,608
because the delegate            
implements, optionally,         

637
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,077
the methods in that protocol    
so we can send it to them.      

638
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,746
If it has no delegate,          
if the delegate is nil,         

639
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,116
because this weak delegate      
property, since it's weak,      

640
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,521
it has to be an optional. All   
weak properties are optional.   

641
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,189
So it could be nil.             
And if it's nil,                

642
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,458
then the ScrollView's just      
not gonna talk to a delegate.   

643
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,828
It's just not gonna ask it any  
questions or tell it anything.  

644
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,166
Now, the controller declares    
that it implements that         

645
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,201
protocol.                       
That's what it has to say.      

646
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,438
It has to say at the top, you   
know, if view, class UI view,   

647
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,107
class calculator view           
controller, whatever,           

648
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,411
UIViewController comma          
UIScrollViewDelegate. So        

649
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,214
it says, I implement that.      
Then the controller sets        

650
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:23,119
itself as the delegate of the   
view, which will be legal now   

651
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,455
because the controller claims   
to implement that protocol.     

652
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:28,024
So it can now be put            
in a var of type                

653
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,260
that protocol. And finally,     

654
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,428
the controller implements       
whatever methods it wants.      

655
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,630
Since they're probably mostly   
optional, it can just pick and  

656
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,699
choose which ones it wants to.  

657
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:40,103
And those did and should        
methods will now start being    

658
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,339
sent to it by the ScrollView    
or whatever, okay?              

659
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,107
So now the view's hooked        
up to the controller.           

660
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,278
The view has no idea who he's   
talking to. All it knows about  

661
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,680
this delegate is that it        
implements those should and     

662
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,015
did things.                     
That's all it knows,            

663
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,684
so it's a completely generic    
and reusable view still.        

664
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,221
But it can communicate with     
the controller. This mechanism  

665
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,524
of delegation, you find         
it all throughout iOS.          

666
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:05,194
Any complicated iOS object is   
gonna use delegation when it    

667
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,430
needs to talk back              
to its controller               

668
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,934
in a complicated way.           
This was all designed, though,  

669
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,770
pre-Swift and pre-closures,     
things like that.               

670
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,006
A lot of times, a closure       
might be a better solution      

671
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:22,145
than delegation. So,            
delegation- a little bit of,    

672
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,182
what do you call it,            
backwards compatibility thing.  

673
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,184
But you still gotta know it     
well if you're gonna do iOS,    

674
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,422
because it's just everywhere    
in iOS. By the way,             

675
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,792
do not use delegation in your   
homework assignment three.      

676
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,927
I think I might even have       
made it a required task.        

677
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,730
You can't do it,                
do not use delegation. I never  

678
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,399
teach you anything after        
the assignment's already,       

679
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:47,603
you know, started.              
Delegation's not for            

680
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,140
assignment three. All right,    
so let's take a quick look at   

681
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,909
what this looks like code-wise  
for ScrollView. First,          

682
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,512
ScrollView's going to have      
a var called delegate.          

683
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,382
It's gonna be of type           
UIScrollViewDelegate optional   

684
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,852
because it's weak. The          
protocol UIScrollViewDelegate   

685
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:06,356
looks like this. It's got       
these optional functions,       

686
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,325
like scrollViewDidScroll and    

687
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,327
give me the viewForZooming      
in the ScrollView,              

688
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,297
etc. Then the controller is     
gonna say, yeah, I implement    

689
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,734
UIScrollViewDelegate by doing   
the little or purple or         

690
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,538
blue or whatever code that is.  
And in viewDidLoad, the view    

691
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,075
controller's gonna say,         
ScrollView's delegate is me.    

692
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,678
So ScrollView, please send      
me all those messages. And      

693
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,281
then it would just implement    
whichever methods it wants.     

694
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,752
And we'll see this in the demo  
I'm gonna do today as well.     

695
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,386
All right, so                   
that's it for delegation.       

696
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:42,925
Let's move on now to the first  
class that uses delegation,     

697
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,794
it's ScrollView. Before I       
talk about ScrollView,          

698
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,462
I wanna show you a little       
bit how ScrollView works,       

699
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,930
this ancient video I have.      

700
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,599
This is like, I don't know,     
iPhone 1 or something. But      

701
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,202
if you look at the way          
it's scrolling,                 

702
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,036
it actually is very             
sophisticated.                  

703
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,805
It can have a horizontally      
scrolling thing,                

704
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,441
like the stock charts, and      

705
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,110
inside of it, have vertically   
scrolling ScrollView.           

706
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,646
So that's ScrollViews           
inside ScrollViews, okay?       

707
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,483
And ScrollView's smart enough   
to know whether you're swiping  

708
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:11,687
sideways or vertically to make  
it scroll. Now let's talk       

709
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,525
about how you put something in  
a ScrollView so you can scroll  

710
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,795
around in it. But you do it     
by adding subviews to it. So    

711
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,698
let's review how we add         
subviews to a normal view. So   

712
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,002
I create a view, like a logo    
view. And I set its frame,      

713
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,203
which is where it's gonna       
be in its superview.            

714
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,940
And then I just add it to its   
superview. So here, I'm saying  

715
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,043
view.addSubview(logo) view is   
probably the top-level view     

716
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,213
in my view controller. Or we    
know that there's a var called  

717
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:40,883
view for that. So               
a ScrollView is similar. But    

718
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:44,153
before you're doing all that,   
you're doing a very important   

719
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,124
step, which is to set the       
contentSize of the scrollView.  

720
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,427
So this is a var contentSize.   
It's a CGSize.                  

721
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,230
And it's gonna be how big       
a space you're going to be      

722
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,932
scrolling over. So you've       
gotta set that first. It's      

723
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,669
very important to set that      
first. But then, after that,    

724
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,705
you just addSubview,            
just like you did before.       

725
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:07,777
So here, I added the, this      
logo view at 2700 across and    

726
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:12,449
50 down. And that's it,         
so now the ScrollView is        

727
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,418
going to scroll around.         
Here, I added another one.      

728
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,987
Let's add two views, okay,      
we got two views in there. And  

729
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,490
now the ScrollView is just      
going to scroll around          

730
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,293
on this content area. You see,  
it's just scrolling around.     

731
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,229
In fact, you'll even see        
the white of the content area   

732
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,733
while you're scrolling around   
to do that. Now, of course,     

733
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,870
you can reposition the views.   
Let's put this big              

734
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,538
aerial view up in the corner.   
And                             

735
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,207
then let's put the Stanford     
logo so that it overlaps it.    

736
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,777
And then we can always change   
our contentSize any time        

737
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,113
we want to not have any         
extra space, right,             

738
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,317
and contain the whole thing.    
So if we do that, then,         

739
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,720
when we're scrolling around,    
we're not seeing                

740
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,024
the white background there. So  
that's how ScrollView works,    

741
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,693
couldn't be simpler. It's       
all about that content size.    

742
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,595
If you forget to set            
the content size,               

743
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:03,533
scroll view will not work. If   
you remember nothing else from  

744
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:07,170
this lecture, remember that.    
Once it's scrolling around,     

745
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,239
you can find out information    
about where it is.              

746
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,041
You can find out                
the upper left corner for       

747
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:15,412
example of where the scroll     
view is. Using scrollView's     

748
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
contentOffset point,            
it'll tell you the x and        

749
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,484
y of the upper left corner of   
where the thing is. You could   

750
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,554
also just say, where is the     
rectangle that is currently     

751
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:29,826
showing the scrollView, where   
is that showing in the view     

752
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,596
behind that like aerial view    
of Stanford? But to do that,    

753
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:36,432
don't forget that those are     
different coordinate systems.   

754
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,100
They're different views so      

755
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,101
they have different             
coordinate systems.             

756
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,670
So you have to convert,         
all right.                      

757
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,606
You're gonna convert the        
scrollView's bounds, right,     

758
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:44,440
the scrollView's bounds,        

759
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,943
that's in the scrollView's      
coordinate system. You're       

760
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,579
gonna convert that to the       
coordinate system of the view   

761
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:53,749
like aerial. See, I'm doing     
aerial.convert up there,        

762
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,452
converting that rectangle.      
Now why are those rectangles    

763
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,554
not the same?                   
Well, a lot of reasons.         

764
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,324
One, you're panning around so   
it's always changing.           

765
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,360
Two, you might be zoomed, so    
it might be quite different.    

766
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,262
If you're zoomed in on that     
scrollView than that little     

767
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,299
rectangle might represent       
a huge piece of aerial or it    

768
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:13,603
might represent a tiny, little  
piece of aerial. Who knows.     

769
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:14,837
So you're gonna use this        
method we already saw.          

770
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:18,374
We saw it when we were          
doing the drawing example.      

771
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,944
I converted center from my      
super view down to my view      

772
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:25,148
here. I'm just converting the   
bound to the scrollView. From   

773
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,916
the scrollView to whatever      
view there that I'm interested  

774
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:33,489
in. All right. Now,             

775
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,359
how do we create one of these   
things? Very straightforward.   

776
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:41,297
We drag it out of the           
utilities area in storyboard.   

777
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,299
It's just a view so you can     
do UIView, scrollView frame     

778
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,503
if you want, but 99% of         
the time we're pulling it out.  

779
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,572
You can also pick a view        
that's already in your          

780
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,676
storyboard and go up to Embed   
and say Embed In -> Scroll      

781
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,211
View. And it'll put it inside   
the scrollView. Okay, so        

782
00:41:55,279 --> 00:42:00,149
that's another way to do that.  
Then you just add whatever      

783
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,918
your too big view is. The view  
you wanna scroll around in.     

784
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,453
You just add it as a sub        
view of the scrollView. But     

785
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,524
of course, you're not gonna     
forget to set the contentSize.  

786
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,861
Okay? And that's it, it's       
really quite simple to use.     

787
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,264
And you can scroll around       
in there programmatically,      

788
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,367
obviously, the user's           
gonna have their touch.         

789
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,636
And they can just pan around,   

790
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,906
but you can do it too by        
saying scrollRectToVisible,     

791
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,375
and it'll take a rectangle and  
make it                         

792
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:29,211
hopefully entirely fit on       
screen. It'll do the minimum    

793
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,847
amount of scrolling necessary   
to get that rectangle,          

794
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,818
on screen. You can do a lot of  
other things in scrollView,     

795
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,554
I don't have time to talk       
about like controlling          

796
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,857
that behavior where it          
only scrolls vertically or      

797
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,994
horizontally and it'll kind of  
on first motion it'll figure    

798
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,530
out which one you mean and      
do that. You can flash          

799
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,168
the scroll indicators when      
the thing appears on screen.    

800
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,240
You can also offset the actual  
content that you're scrolling   

801
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,808
over by a little bit.           

802
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,043
This happens a lot in           
navigation controllers.         

803
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,946
Sometimes the bar at the top,   
which is semi-opaque, or        

804
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,049
semi-transparent, is not        
transparent enough for          

805
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,819
the application of the,         
whatever you're looking at in   

806
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,421
your scroll view. So            
you'll offset it a little bit,  

807
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,825
the content you'll offset by    
that height of the, navigation  

808
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,394
draw. So there's a whole bunch  
of stuff in there I can't       

809
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:22,564
really talk about. Another      
big piece of this is zooming.   

810
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,001
So, we've talked about panning  
around in the scroll view but   

811
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,403
you can also use your           
pinching to zoom in and         

812
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:32,007
out. So zooming in and          
out, the way that works,        

813
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,611
all UIViews have a property     
called their transform.         

814
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,316
It's an affine transform which  
means it has translate, scale,  

815
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:44,253
and rotate. And                 
when you pinch on a view,       

816
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,490
all it's doing is affecting     
the scale of its transform,     

817
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,060
does nothing else.              
Now that for most views, for    

818
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,395
all views, that's going         
to scale the bits up. So        

819
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,265
if you zoomed in really big,    
you'd have really big pixels.   

820
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:59,869
It would look really grainy.    
But if the view wants to,       

821
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:03,172
it can make it look really      
good after the zooming is       

822
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:07,710
done, for example, UIImageView  
does that. If you're zooming    

823
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,647
in on a UI image and its got    
more bits of resolution, it'll  

824
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,816
show them to you as you zoom    
in, and you could do that, for  

825
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,020
example, with your calculator.  
If you had your calculator in   

826
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,421
a scroll view,                  
which you're not going to.      

827
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,859
But if you did, if you had the  
graph part of it, you could,    

828
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,561
when it pinched in, when it     
was done pinching, you could    

829
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,365
re-draw the graph to give it    
nice smooth curves, right, so   

830
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:32,301
it wouldn't be all pixelated.   
All right,                      

831
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,371
I'll show you how to do         
that in the next slide. So,     

832
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,774
two things about zooming in     
a scroll view though that you   

833
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,310
have to know. One is you        
have to set the minimum and     

834
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:44,880
maximum zoom scale. So that's   
how far you'll zoom in, and     

835
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,049
how far you're allowed          
to zoom out. And                

836
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:51,754
by default these are 1.0 and    
1.0, meaning no zooming in and  

837
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:55,324
no zooming out. So you have     
to set these to something. So   

838
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:58,027
if you set the minimum          
zoom scale to 0.5,              

839
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,030
means you'll zoom down          
to half its normal size.        

840
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,597
And if you set the maximum      
zoom scale to 2.0 it means      

841
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,034
you're gonna zoom out to twice  
its normal size. All right, so  

842
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:08,838
you can decide how much you     
want to let your users zoom in  

843
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:13,408
and out. The other piece is     
you need a delegate method.     

844
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:16,278
Zooming does not work           
without delegation. And so      

845
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,881
you have to implement this      
delegate method called          

846
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,950
viewForZooming(in scrollView)   
and all you have to do is       

847
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,253
return the view that's          
in the scroll view,             

848
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:28,056
one of the subviews, the one    
that you're going to zoom on.   

849
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:33,162
And this is the one whose       
transform transformed.          

850
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:38,400
Of course you can zoom          
programmatically as well.       

851
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,835
It's not just                   
pinching to zoom.               

852
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,438
You can set the zoom scale.     
Here's some examples on how to  

853
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,574
do that. So here I set my zoom  
scale to 1.2, now I'm gonna     

854
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:48,810
set it to 1.0. See it           
goes back to normal size.       

855
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:53,449
1.2 I'm zoomed in 20% okay or   
same thing with rect. If I put  

856
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:56,052
a little rectangle right there  
and I say zoom to that rect     

857
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,354
it's gonna zoom that rect       
out as big as it can be.        

858
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,723
Or if I had a rectangle         
that was bigger and             

859
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,025
I said zoom to rect it          
will zoom it down so            

860
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,327
the rectangle fits. Okay        
it's going to do the minimum    

861
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:10,599
zooming to get that             
rectangle on screen.            

862
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,835
There's lot of of other         
delegate methods,               

863
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,604
at least a dozen more besides   
that view for zooming and       

864
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,341
scrollView. For example,        
if you wanted to do the thing   

865
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,077
where you zoomed in and         
then you wanted to re-draw      

866
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,978
to get rid of the pixelation,   
you would implement             

867
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:27,983
scrollViewDidEndZooming with    
view atScale. And               

868
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,452
this will tell you when         
the pinching has stopped and    

869
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,089
now you can re-draw.            
Of course if you re-draw by     

870
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,657
the way at the new scale,       
you're gonna reset              

871
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,060
your transform,                 
the view's transform,           

872
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,329
back to the identity            
transform. Otherwise, you'll    

873
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,433
both drawing it scaled and it   
will be scaled because you're   

874
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:47,202
affine transform is well        
pixelated too. So, you don't    

875
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,871
want both of those things       
going on at the same time.      

876
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,441
So you reset, you would         
reset your transform here.      

877
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,181
Okay, so the rest of this       
is going to be demo, so         

878
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,916
let me just talk about          
what's coming up here.          

879
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,320
The demo I'm gonna do is        
a Scroll View Demo, obviously.  

880
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,321
I'm gonna show you              
how to do that,                 

881
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,022
I'll show you some other        
things too, like extensions,    

882
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:09,958
things like that.               
On Friday we have               

883
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,195
Instruments. Okay, performance  
testing. Really important if    

884
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,630
you want to do the extra        
credit in Assignment 3,         

885
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,398
which is a good one,            

886
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,068
you have to figure out          
why your calculator,            

887
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,404
graphing thing doesn't perform  
as well as you'd like.          

888
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,974
On Monday, Assignment 3,        
what you're working on now,     

889
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:27,877
your graphing calculator        
is due, before lecture. And     

890
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,112
then the topic on Monday is     
going to be multi-threading.    

891
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,047
We're gonna take the demo       
we're doing today,              

892
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,682
which is going to               
be very sluggish,               

893
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,551
and we're going to make it      
perform a lot better using      

894
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,722
multi-threading. On Wednesday,  
we're going to go into          

895
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,792
TableView, really important     
part of the UIKit.              

896
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,061
There will be an assignment, a  
TableView assignment that goes  

897
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,498
out on Wednesday. It'll be      
due the next Wednesday. And     

898
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,667
there's no more reading         
assignments. I can tell from    

899
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,770
talking to some of you that     
you didn't read any of          

900
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,041
them very closely. And you      
know, I don't quiz you on it,   

901
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:02,678
I don't test you on it because  
it's kind of up to you how      

902
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,680
much you wanna learn            
in this class.                  

903
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:06,415
It's just one of those things   
where whatever you put into     

904
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,250
it is what you get out of it.   
But                             

905
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,888
I really encourage you to at    
least go through the parts      

906
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,491
in there that you               
don't understand, and           

907
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,226
be cognizant of the fact, I     
don't really understand this.   

908
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,396
Okay, because then when you     
graduate from this class,       

909
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,532
which is, you know, you're      
getting started with iOS in     

910
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,168
this class. When you graduate   
from it you'll know,            

911
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,770
okay that's something           
I gotta go back and             

912
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,706
really understand better.       
All right, okay so              

913
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:35,343
this demo is going to be,       
again, fresh start.             

914
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,180
So I'm gonna create a new       
Xcode project in single view    

915
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,815
application.                    
I'm gonna call it Cassini,      

916
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,486
cuz we're gonna do some stuff   
with the images that came out   

917
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,823
back from Cassini probe         
that went off to Saturn.        

918
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:50,793
And I'm gonna put it in the     
same place I put all my maps,   

919
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:55,264
home directory Developer.       
And here it is I'm gonna move   

920
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,600
xcassets and the AppDelegate    
and the LaunchScreen out        

921
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,571
of the way again. I'm actually  
not going to move info.plist    

922
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,075
out though. We are going to     
be looking at that today. So    

923
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,378
we're gonna put these           
in Supporting Files.            

924
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,582
Now, I showed you last          
time how we can rename          

925
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:17,553
a ViewController, if it's got   
like a generic name like this.  

926
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,120
You know, another thing         
we could do to this             

927
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:22,757
ViewController, is just delete  
it. So I'm just gonna go here,  

928
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,162
right click on it, and delete   
it. And remove all references   

929
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,264
to it and I'm gonna go to my    
storyboard right here, which    

930
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:33,068
still has this ViewController.  
And by the way, if I go look    

931
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,671
at the identity inspector       
here for that ViewController.   

932
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,640
It's still trying to be         
class ViewController,           

933
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,876
even though I deleted that      
from my app, all right.         

934
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,345
But I'm gonna fix that by       
just deleting that from my      

935
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:47,083
storyboard. All right, so now   
no ViewController anywhere.     

936
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:51,420
Now, I do need a view           
controller for my app and       

937
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,022
it's gonna be called            
ImageViewController.            

938
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,659
It's going to be a generic,     
reusable MVC for showing        

939
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:02,598
an image. Whenever I build an   
MVC, I always wanna see if I    

940
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,300
can build a nice generic        
reusable one because then       

941
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,537
maybe I can use it in some      
other app that I'm building.    

942
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,039
And also it gives me            
the discipline as an API        

943
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,410
designer to think about my      
public and private API even.    

944
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,513
So, let's go ahead and do       
that, let's create a new file.  

945
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:20,249
Coco Touch Class of course,     
and we'll call it               

946
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,119
ImageViewController, it's a     
subclass of UIViewController.   

947
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,687
Okay, very carefully here,      

948
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,824
I do not wanna put this at the  
top level. I wanna put it down  

949
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:34,296
in here where the rest of       
my files are. All right so      

950
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,865
I got my ImageViewController    
here. I don't need for          

951
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:40,669
now anyway, any of the          
ViewController lifecycle. I'm   

952
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:45,206
also not going to segue from    
this MVC. So I don't need any   

953
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,410
of that. I actually I'm going   
to be segueing to it however,   

954
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,212
because it's a nice reusable    
image showing things.           

955
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:55,217
So as you can imagine I might   
want to be segueing to it any   

956
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:59,521
time I want to show an image.   
When I have a new class like    

957
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,092
this one the first things I     
like to do is think about what  

958
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:09,598
is my model? Because the model  
is what this MVC does?          

959
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,102
So if I can determine what      
the model is, it'll help me     

960
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,304
think clearly about what        
this MVC is all about.          

961
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,340
And so this shows an image, so  

962
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:22,144
I'm gonna have my model,        
I'm gonna have it be public so  

963
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:26,014
other people can set my model,  
and I'm going to have it be     

964
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,084
a URL of an image.              
Because what does my MVC does?  

965
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,519
It shows an image. That's what  
it is, an image shower. So,     

966
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:36,124
it seems like having a URL of   
an image would be a good model  

967
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:42,130
for it. Now, let's go back      
to our storyboard here and      

968
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,733
create an MVC for this thing.   
So I'm just gonna grab          

969
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,671
a View Controller. Drag it      
out here. Gonna go up to        

970
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:52,140
the identity inspector, again,  
and I'm gonna set it to be      

971
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:56,512
an ImageViewController,         
right? Now,                     

972
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,248
I could start building my UI    
here by dragging more things    

973
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,319
in, but I thought it might be   
valuable a little bit, to show  

974
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,121
you how to build some UI in     
code. It's gonna be simple,     

975
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,690
but we'll build some UI in      
code. And what my UI here is    

976
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:12,994
gonna be at the beginning is    
just an ImageViewController or  

977
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,765
a UIImageView, right? I'm just  
going to show an image using    

978
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:20,268
UIImageView, this class         
UIImageView. By the way,        

979
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,973
one thing that's missing here,  
you can tell by this warning.   

980
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,774
Let's click on this warning     
and see what it says.           

981
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,109
It says ImageViewController     
is unreachable.                 

982
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:32,047
Remember that? There's no way   
to get to this. That's because  

983
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:35,885
there is no arrow that          
goes into this anywhere.        

984
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:37,953
If I were to run this app,      
it would crash and              

985
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,423
say, there's no initial         
View Controller. So,            

986
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,058
how do you set the initial      
View Controller? Well,          

987
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,494
you pick the View Controller    
you want to be the initial one  

988
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,831
and you go over here to the     
Attributes Inspector because    

989
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:52,200
it's an attribute of that       
View Controller. And down here  

990
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,337
under View Controller right     
after its title is, is Initial  

991
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:58,807
View Controller. So, I click    
that and look what happened.    

992
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,343
You got the little              
entry arrow there. So           

993
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,012
now when this thing run, it's   
gonna jump right into this      

994
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,882
View Controller. Which is       
where we wanted to start.       

995
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,617
Eventually we're gonna          
have other MVCs, but            

996
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,454
we'll start with this one.      
All right,                      

997
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,790
back to my ImageViewController  
here. I said I wanted to        

998
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,261
build its UI in code.           
I know I need ImageView so      

999
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,798
I'm just gonna start right off  
with private var imageView:     

1000
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:26,168
is a UIImageView.               
And in fact, I'm gonna          

1001
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,937
create it right here. There's   
no reason not just to say,      

1002
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:32,341
this, it's going to create it   
with basically CGRect zero.     

1003
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,976
This is just like saying        
frame: CGRect.zero,             

1004
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,246
it's exactly the same as doing  
that, but you know we don't     

1005
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:41,350
need that extra code there.     
So now I've created this image  

1006
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,486
view, it's in the upper left    
hand corner of whatever its     

1007
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,988
super view is, it's not in      
any super view yet, and         

1008
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,057
it's of zero zero size.         
So it's not that useful, but    

1009
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:52,461
of course, as soon as I set an  
image in it, I will resize it   

1010
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,331
to fit that image. And          
speaking of setting an image    

1011
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,502
in it, I imagine that when I    
set an image in my imageView,   

1012
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:05,773
I'm gonna need to do things     
like change the the frame,      

1013
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,643
of my imageView, and            
things like that.               

1014
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,778
So I'm gonna create             
a little private var here,      

1015
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,614
called image, which is          
gonna be a UIImage and          

1016
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:15,650
it's gonna be computed and      
it's gonna have a get and       

1017
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,653
a set so that every time        
I get or set the image,         

1018
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,524
I can do other stuff.           
Okay, this is a really kind of  

1019
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,228
simple clean way to keep, you   
know to do ancillary things     

1020
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:30,466
when you're settings and        
getting some piece of data.     

1021
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:33,869
So, for example, when I         
set this image right here,      

1022
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,840
I'm going to set the            
imageView's image to be equal   

1023
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:42,444
to that new value of course.    
That's the primary thing if I   

1024
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:45,780
wanna set my image, I need      
to set it in my imageView.      

1025
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,817
So this var right here is just  
the image that this imageView   

1026
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,920
is showing. But                 
then also like I said,          

1027
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:56,959
I want to set my imageView's    
size to fit this new image.     

1028
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,695
In fact, there happens to be    
a method called sizeToFit in    

1029
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,531
imageView that will cause       
it to size its frame to         

1030
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,032
fit whatever image              
is inside of it.                

1031
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,669
So it's nice that it had        
that this nice method for       

1032
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,405
me right here. If I control     
click on it, you can read it.   

1033
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,040
See that's what it says.        

1034
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,576
And then how about getting it?  
Well, I'm just gonna return     

1035
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:19,347
the imageView's image in        
this case. Okay, so this        

1036
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,918
is a var and it's computed,     
so there's no storage. And      

1037
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:26,555
actually I'm doing the storage  
here in the imageView. Now,     

1038
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,491
this is giving me an error      
right here. And the error it's  

1039
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,527
giving me is that I need        
to unwrap this. Well,           

1040
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,897
that's because this image       
right here is an optional.      

1041
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,066
Cuz imageViews don't            
have to have an image,          

1042
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:40,468
they could be                   
empty at the time.              

1043
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,471
Now I could unwrap this here,   
but I'm thinking,               

1044
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,709
you know what? I want my UI to  
be able to be showing no image  

1045
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,345
at some point. That's           
perfectly reasonable. So        

1046
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:55,283
instead, I'm gonna change       
this to be optional. So this    

1047
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,987
image var is optional, it can   
be nil. And when I do that I    

1048
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,090
wanna make sure that I can say  
imageView.image = newValue,     

1049
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,727
is that gonna work if newValue  
is nil? Yes, it is because      

1050
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:09,898
we know that this imageView's   
image is itself an optional.    

1051
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:12,434
The imageView might have        
no image at this time.          

1052
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:17,238
It's perfectly fine. Okay,      
everybody cool, understand      

1053
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,608
what I did there? It's just     
a code organization thing,      

1054
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,478
it just keeps me from           
having to, you know,            

1055
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,414
be resizing this fit somewhere  
else. Or to be putting          

1056
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,950
in some other part of my code   
that makes no sense. Here it    

1057
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,086
makes sense because here's      
where I'm setting my image.     

1058
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:36,191
All right, let's now            
put this imageView into         

1059
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,662
our view hierarchy in code.     
I told you we were gonna do     

1060
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,832
our UI with code. Let's do it.  
We're gonna say viewDidLoad is  

1061
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,501
a good place to do this         
because we know that by         

1062
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,237
the time viewDidLoad happens,   
we're fully initialized.        

1063
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,005
All our outlets are set.        

1064
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,709
We've been prepared if          
someone's segueing to us.       

1065
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,878
We're in a really good state    
right now to add more things    

1066
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:59,814
to our UI. And I'm gonna do     
that just by saying view,       

1067
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,951
remember that the special bar   
in View Controller which is     

1068
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:08,022
the top level view.             
AddSubview my imageView,        

1069
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,292
okay? So                        
I'm just putting it on there.   

1070
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:16,498
It'll either be zero zero size  
or if someone set my imageURL,  

1071
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:20,569
then it might be sized          
to fit or whatever.             

1072
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:23,772
Okay, now what happens if       
someone sets my imageURL?       

1073
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:27,042
I better set this image, okay?  
And we know a good way to do    

1074
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,445
that, right? So our property    
observer here on our model,     

1075
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,715
any time someone sets our       
model. First I'm gonna          

1076
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,751
actually clear out whatever     
image I have. And then I'm      

1077
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,455
gonna put the fetching of       
an image in another method.     

1078
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:44,392
Remember that this imageURL     
might be an Internet URL and    

1079
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,595
this might be a slow Internet,  
this might take a long time.    

1080
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:51,065
So I'm gonna put it all off     
into this other function here,  

1081
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,368
private function, fetchImage.   

1082
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:56,338
And it's gonna do               
the image fetching. So          

1083
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,040
how do we fetch an image        
from a URL, all right?          

1084
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,442
It's actually remarkably easy.  

1085
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,378
First, I'm gonna make sure      
that I have a URL to fetch.     

1086
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:09,717
I'm gonna say, if I can let     
a url equal our imageURL,       

1087
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:15,223
that's our model, okay? If I    
can get my imageURL there,      

1088
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:18,627
then I'm going to let the       
contents of that URL, so I'm    

1089
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,063
gonna go out in the Internet    
and get the contents of it.     

1090
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:28,637
I'm gonna let that equal        
Data(contentsOf: url).          

1091
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,673
So data is that bag of bits,    
thing I told you about          

1092
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:35,110
a few lectures ago. And it      
has a really cool initializer   

1093
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,513
which is load up your bag of    
bits with whatever's at this    

1094
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:43,484
URL on the Internet. Now, this  
has an error right here. And    

1095
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,688
the error is that this throws,  

1096
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:51,059
because that URL might not      
point to something, or          

1097
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:55,530
it might be a malformed URL,    
or it might be a URL to some,   

1098
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,733
you know, bad data or           
something like that.            

1099
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:02,070
So, if I look at this error     
here, it's complaining about    

1100
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:06,407
the immutable. But it's also    
saying this call can throw,     

1101
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,276
but is not marked               
with a try and                  

1102
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:12,614
the error is not handled. Now   
here, someone's asking me to    

1103
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:16,818
show this imageURL. I suppose   
I could catch that error and    

1104
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,953
like put up an alert saying,    

1105
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:23,524
here was the reason I couldn't  
show your, display your image.  

1106
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:28,730
But I'm just going to instead   
use try, with a question mark,  

1107
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,468
and if I can't get it, then I   
just won't show it. Which is    

1108
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:38,740
probably not that great but     
it's good enough for a demo.    

1109
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:42,043
So now as soon as I put try     
question mark here, this is no  

1110
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,615
longer going to be of type      
data. It's gonna be what type?  

1111
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:52,386
Yeah, it's optional. See, it's  
an optional data because if it  

1112
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,990
throws, it can come back nil.   
All right, since this is        

1113
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:00,762
optional, I'm gonna say if I    
can let the imageData equal to  

1114
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:05,166
the contents of that URL.       
Then, now I can create          

1115
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:09,937
the UIImage with that and sure  
enough my image which is this   

1116
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,541
var right here is gonna be      
equal to UIImage. And image,    

1117
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,811
we all know about Image named,  
but there's also Image,         

1118
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,617
with the imageData. So if you   
have the actual JPEG data or    

1119
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:26,321
whatever, you can make          
an image out of that.           

1120
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,322
And of course, when I do        
image = UIImage here,           

1121
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,358
it's gonna go down              
here to this setter.            

1122
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:33,728
It's gonna set that image       
in the UIImageView.             

1123
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,597
Which we added as a subView     
and then it's gonna size to     

1124
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:41,903
fit that imageView and          
show it to us, all right?       

1125
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,005
Okay, now, there's only         
one problem with this,          

1126
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:47,843
one thing I don't like about    
this. Which is well, let's do   

1127
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:50,245
one other thing too. I'm gonna  
go to viewDidLoad here and      

1128
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,748
have it do a demo URL,          
so we can see.                  

1129
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,085
I'm gonna set my own            
imageURL equal to and           

1130
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,655
I have these demo URLs here.    
Okay, it's this little thing    

1131
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:06,094
right here. Copy that in.       
These demo URLs have a for      

1132
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,063
example, a little               
Stanford URL right here and     

1133
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,467
also some NASA ones which       
we'll be doing next time.       

1134
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,571
But I'm just gonna use this     
Stanford URL right here. So     

1135
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:22,844
our imageURL is                 
DemoURL.stanford.               

1136
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:26,014
What I don't like about the     
way we've written this code     

1137
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,817
though is here in viewDidLoad,  
I'm setting my imageURL to      

1138
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,120
stanford.                       
That's gonna go up here and     

1139
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,689
cause this fetchImage           
to immediately happen.          

1140
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:38,993
Which is gonna go out in the    
Internet and grab this image.   

1141
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,762
So as soon                      
viewDidLoad happens,            

1142
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:43,698
man, I'm not on the Internet    
getting that thing. And         

1143
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,568
that's probably not something   
you wanna do, why wouldn't      

1144
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:51,139
you. Imagine this MVC which is  
supposed to be reusable was in  

1145
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:57,645
a tab bar, okay. All of the     
MVCs that are in the tab bar,   

1146
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:02,350
they're all created in          
viewDidLoaded even before       

1147
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:06,721
any of them are shown. So, if   
I had a tab bar that had five   

1148
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,191
image view controllers right    
here, they'd all be off on      

1149
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,361
the Internet loading things.    
I might not click on any of     

1150
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,430
them. And                       
I wasted the cellular data      

1151
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:18,066
plan of my user, all right.     

1152
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:22,670
So I really only wanna go       
fetch this URL when this        

1153
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:26,775
view controller is going to     
appear on screen for sure. So   

1154
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:29,377
can anyone think of where I     
would put that instead of in    

1155
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:34,649
viewDidLoad there? Different    
view controller lifecycle       

1156
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:40,254
method.                         
How about viewWillAppear?       

1157
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:45,092
Super.viewWillAppear. So        

1158
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,096
I'm going to do the actual      
fetching in viewWillAppear.     

1159
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:52,434
Now, I wanna do this, no?       
Okay, there's another problem   

1160
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:54,368
though. What if I'm             
already onscreen and            

1161
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:58,173
someone sets my image? Then I   
can't do it in viewWillAppear.  

1162
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,808
I've gotta do it right away.    
So I can kind of                

1163
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,745
really just want to delay       
doing it to viewWillAppear      

1164
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:07,181
if I'm not on screen already.   
So what I'm gonna do up here    

1165
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,486
with my imageURL up here        
is I'm just gonna check and     

1166
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:16,792
see if I'm currently on         
screen and if I am, so          

1167
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:22,730
I'm gonna say if my             
view.window is not nil,         

1168
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,100
then I'm gonna go fetch this    
image right away, okay. So      

1169
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,004
view, remember that's the var   
that's the top level thing.     

1170
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:33,441
Window is a var that is in      
all UI views which tells        

1171
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,644
you the window it's in. And     
if you don't have a window,     

1172
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,614
it means you're not on screen.  
If you do have a window,        

1173
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:43,151
you are on screen. So           
if my view.window is not nil,   

1174
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,152
then I'm on screen.             
I'm gonna go ahead and fetch.   

1175
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,056
Otherwise I'm not gonna fetch.  
And instead down here in        

1176
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:53,595
viewWillAppear, I'm gonna       
say if my image is nil. So      

1177
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:59,434
if I don't have an image yet    
so far, then go fetch it. So    

1178
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,870
you see how the combination of  
these two things is going to    

1179
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:06,007
wait to fetch it until view     
will appear. Unless I'm         

1180
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:09,911
already on screen, then it'll   
fetch it right away. So         

1181
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,246
that's at least delaying it.    

1182
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,182
So now if I were in tab bars,   
when I clicked on the tab,      

1183
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,351
viewWillAppear would happen     
and I would load up. And        

1184
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,954
if I did something that caused  
the image to change, it would   

1185
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:23,425
change right away, cuz I'd be   
visible. If I went offscreen,   

1186
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,994
then clicked on another tab,    
my image was changed,           

1187
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,762
it wouldn't change.             
When I click on it,             

1188
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:29,030
then it would go get            
it from the Internet.           

1189
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,600
So, I'm minimizing the amount   
of data plan usage              

1190
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,837
if the person's going,          
doing it over cell.             

1191
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,206
Okay, so, I think we got        
everything we need here to      

1192
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:42,209
make this work. Let's try       
running, let's go on an iPhone  

1193
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:48,883
7. Hopefully our network works  
on this laptop here. Okay, so,  

1194
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:53,321
it comes up here, and it's not  
showing. Where is our image?    

1195
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,524
We don't have any image. Well,  
I think I see something in      

1196
01:04:56,592 --> 01:05:01,763
the console down here. Let's    
see what that says. It says,    

1197
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:07,168
App Transport Security has      
blocked a cleartext HTTP,       

1198
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:11,605
hm. It's insecure, of course,   
we know HTTP is insecure,       

1199
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:14,942
HTTPS is secure. It says,       
temporary exceptions can be     

1200
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,979
configured via your app's       
Info.plist file. Luckily,       

1201
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,282
I didn't move my Info.plist     
into Supporting Files,          

1202
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:23,885
cuz I knew this was gonna       
happen, obviously. So           

1203
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:25,052
what's going on here?           

1204
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:28,756
Well, if you look at the URL    
that we're trying to load,      

1205
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:32,227
this Stanford URL,              
see it's an insecure HTTP URL.  

1206
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,163
And by default, iOS does        
not let you load those up.      

1207
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:39,400
You have to say that you're     
willing to load those up        

1208
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,670
untrusted URLs and you do       
that with this Info.plist.      

1209
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:47,008
So what is an Info.plist? It's  
really just a list of some      

1210
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:51,679
settings, some configurations.  
For example, it shows, will     

1211
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:54,248
you run in portrait mode? Will  
you run in landscape left?      

1212
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,651
In landscape right?             
Those kinds of things.          

1213
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,954
It's really kind of runtime     
configuration, how your app     

1214
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:04,458
will run. So we can add         
this App Transport Security     

1215
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,494
that we need right here         
by right-clicking, okay,        

1216
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:10,398
we right-click. Pay attention   
here, cuz you're gonna need to  

1217
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,801
do this probably, in a, maybe   
in a future homework. But       

1218
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,404
we're gonna right-click and     
pick Add Row.                   

1219
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:19,273
So that's gonna add a row.      
Oops, we don't wanna add        

1220
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,710
a row there, sorry. That added  
a row to our support interface  

1221
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,811
configuration.                  
>> So                           

1222
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,715
we wanna be not selecting       
that, and do Add Row. And       

1223
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:30,684
if you go look in Add Row,      
right near the top is App       

1224
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,488
transport security settings.    
You see it right there? So      

1225
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:37,492
I'm gonna click on that then    
I'm gonna open the security     

1226
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,595
settings. Don't forget to       
open those settings and         

1227
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,398
then hit plus which will        
add a security setting and      

1228
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,433
here you can see the options.   
And                             

1229
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,302
we want the one which is        
allow arbitrary loads.          

1230
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,073
We'll allow any HTTP URL to be  
loaded and we're gonna go over  

1231
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:56,478
here and say that that is yes.  
So allows arbitrary loads,      

1232
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:59,680
yes, okay? So we just add       
this to our Info.plist,         

1233
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,250
now when we run our app, we've  
given permission, essentially,  

1234
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:09,023
for the app to load             
these http non-S URLs.          

1235
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,658
Okay, there we go,              
look at that, woo hoo!          

1236
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:13,661
We got Stanford, and            
we can even rotate.             

1237
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:17,531
Good, now of course we can't    
see the whole image here and    

1238
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,468
we can't zoom in. It would be   
nice to be able to zoom in.     

1239
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,038
For that we obviously           
need a scroll view. So          

1240
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:27,141
how are we going to put         
a scroll view in here? Well,    

1241
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,745
this is a good opportunity      
to show you mixing code for     

1242
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:35,382
doing your views in code, with  
doing it in the storyboard.     

1243
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:38,753
So I'm gonna put my Scroll      
View in the storyboard, and     

1244
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:41,722
we'll leave the image view in   
code. Okay, so you see them     

1245
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,825
both working together. So       
to put a Scroll View here in    

1246
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,194
my storyboard,                  
I'm going to just search for    

1247
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,365
Scroll View down here in the    
utilities window, there it is.  

1248
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,234
I'm gonna drag out              
a scroll view, here it is.      

1249
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:57,171
I'm gonna use the blue lines    
to put it in the whole,         

1250
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,943
filling my whole, MVC here,     
without even any borders.       

1251
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,579
Then I'm gonna use this         
little reset to suggested       

1252
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,480
constraints, you                
remember that?                  

1253
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,517
To have it do the auto          
layout for me.                  

1254
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,620
Then I'm actually gonna go      
up to the size inspector,       

1255
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:16,057
right here, and click on it     
to double-check what it did,    

1256
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:18,526
in terms of constraints.        
And sure enough,                

1257
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,429
it's done exactly the           
constraints I want, all right?  

1258
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,265
So we have this. We wanna       
talk to the scroll view,        

1259
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:27,768
of course we need an outlet     
to it. So, let's get our        

1260
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:32,940
controller on screen at         
the same time here and let's    

1261
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:36,978
control drag. I'm gonna put it  
to scroll view down here by     

1262
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:40,147
the image view. So let's        
control drag right into our     

1263
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:43,317
code right there. It's          
an outlet, get to scroll view,  

1264
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,920
notice it's weak.               
We talked about why our         

1265
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:49,790
outlets are weak. I'm gonna     
call this outlet scrollView.    

1266
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,261
Cuz that's what it is. Var      
scrollView right there. Now,    

1267
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:58,399
I want to integrate the image   
view into the scroll view,      

1268
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:03,304
so I'm just going to,           
when the scroll view gets set,  

1269
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:07,942
I'm just gonna add that         
image view as a sub view.       

1270
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:12,546
Okay, and now I don't need      
to do that in viewDidLoad.      

1271
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,183
Where is viewDidLoad?           
Okay, don't need to do adding   

1272
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:17,084
the image view as               
a sub view of our top           

1273
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,821
level view because now I'm      
adding it as a sub view of      

1274
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,523
the scroll view, all right?     
Make sense? So,                 

1275
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:24,592
let's see if that just works.   
That should just work.          

1276
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,964
Yeah, it's good. You should     
all be thinking about,          

1277
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,767
hm, why wouldn't that work?     
I'm gonna ask you why it's not  

1278
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:35,570
working in a second. All        
right, here it is! It looks     

1279
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,507
like it works. Let's scroll,    
we can't scroll around. Why?    

1280
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,143
I know I put a scroll view in   
there. How come the scroll      

1281
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:46,814
view's not scrolling? Anyone    
have an idea? Okay, the,        

1282
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,816
he's saying                     
the the two variables,          

1283
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,517
the zooming things.             
Well, that's true.              

1284
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,754
That's why it won't zoom,       
but it won't even pan.          

1285
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:56,791
Why won't it even pan around,   
let alone zoom?                 

1286
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:57,357
>> Content size.                

1287
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:58,625
>> Content size, exactly.       

1288
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,260
We haven't set                  
the content size.               

1289
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,497
So, this scroll view actually   
is panning around the content   

1290
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:08,503
size, it's just that the        
content size is zero-zero. So,  

1291
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,004
when you are trying             
to pan around,                  

1292
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,573
it's like you're not even over  
that zero, zero spot, and       

1293
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:15,410
it's impossible to be over it.  
So, we want the content size    

1294
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:18,246
to be encompassing this         
whole image here so             

1295
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:21,115
we can pan around with it,      
so let's do that.               

1296
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:24,418
Now, where do we want to        
set our content size?           

1297
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:27,621
There's actually two times      
that we wanna do it.            

1298
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,191
For sure when our scroll view   
is first hooked up here,        

1299
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,526
we're gonna wanna set           
our content size.               

1300
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,997
So I'm gonna say the            
contentSize here equals and     

1301
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,600
what is our contentSize         
gonna be equal too? Well,       

1302
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:43,471
it's our image view's           
frame size, okay?               

1303
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,340
We want to enclose our          
entire image view.              

1304
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,643
So, whatever the size           
of our imageView is,            

1305
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,645
that's what we the content      
size of our scrollView to be.   

1306
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,882
But there's another time we're  
gonna wanna sent the content    

1307
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,351
size, which is if our           
image changes, right?           

1308
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,520
If you put a new image in       
there, then we're gonna have    

1309
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,288
to adjust our content           
size to make a change.          

1310
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:04,291
And luckily, woo hoo, we have   
this nice var down here,        

1311
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,161
so that every time we set       
our image, we can do things.    

1312
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,364
And sure enough, right here,    
I'm just gonna say,             

1313
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,469
scrollView.contentsize equals   
the imageView.frame.size.       

1314
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:18,239
Now, this might seem good.      
But actually this is very bad.  

1315
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:22,210
And the reason for that is      
that. If we're in image         

1316
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,746
view controller, and            
we're getting prepared.         

1317
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,483
Someone's going to              
set our image url.              

1318
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:31,819
That's how they're gonna        
prepare us right? So            

1319
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,622
let's follow what that's gonna  
do. So imageURL is going to     

1320
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:41,996
set the image to nil,           
down here. Set this image,      

1321
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,165
to nil, and it's gonna try to   
execute this line of code,      

1322
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:50,771
and that is gonna crash.        
Because when we're preparing,   

1323
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:55,943
our outlets are not set so      
this is nil. So the way around  

1324
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:59,113
that? Question mark. This       
optional chain. If it's nil,    

1325
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:01,082
I won't be setting the          
contentSize of the scrollView,  

1326
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,885
but that's okay cuz later,      
I'll come along and             

1327
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,787
do it here when the outlet      
does get hooked up. So,         

1328
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,690
this is just to remind you      
that any time you're accessing  

1329
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:13,561
outlets and methods that might  
be called during prepare, you   

1330
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:18,599
need to optionally chain them,  
okay? So it doesn't crash       

1331
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,169
your app during prepare. All    
right, so let's go ahead and    

1332
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,939
see if that fixed everything,   
set our content size here.      

1333
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:32,379
Should be good to go.           
All right,                      

1334
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:37,318
here's our image, and look at   
that, scrolls nicely, rotate,   

1335
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:42,190
okay, scroll. Okay, and notice  
it has a kinda this little      

1336
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,092
thing where you scroll too      
far and it bounces back.        

1337
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,529
You can control that, by the    
way, and scrollView's one of    

1338
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:51,765
its settings, all right? Oops,  
wrong rotation there, okay,     

1339
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,670
we got it? Now, of course, now  
we'd like to zoom in. We wanna  

1340
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,238
look and see if we can find     
any of ourselves down here.     

1341
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,541
Maybe that's one of us right    
there. We're gonna zoom in and  

1342
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,545
see. But for zooming,           
as he was saying up above,      

1343
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:07,881
we need to make sure we set     
the minimum and maximum         

1344
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,551
zoom scale. Cuz actually        
the minimum and maximum         

1345
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,955
zoom scale are set right now,   
they're set to 1.0. So          

1346
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:18,526
that's minimum and max, it      
means no scrolling. All right,  

1347
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,128
so let's set that. A good       
place to set that is probably   

1348
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,197
when our scroll view is first   
hooked up as an outlet.         

1349
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,734
So we'll just do this here,     
we'll say,                      

1350
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:30,872
scrollView.minimumZoomScale.    
Let's go really small,          

1351
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:34,942
how bout 0.03, okay,            
3% of the size will go,         

1352
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:38,111
make allow our image            
to be really small.             

1353
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,415
And maximum, just to show you   
the difference, we'll make it   

1354
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:44,819
only, so we can only be twice   
as big. Or, or we can even      

1355
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,487
make it so it can't be bigger,  
right? 1.0 would be,            

1356
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,090
it can never be any             
bigger than it is.              

1357
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,258
It could be smaller, but not    
bigger. Which we might want,    

1358
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:54,261
because if it's allowed to be   
bigger than its natural size,   

1359
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,763
it's gonna start                
getting pixellated and          

1360
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,232
we don't want that. But just    
so you can see it happening.    

1361
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:04,438
And what's the other thing we   
need to make zooming work? No   

1362
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:09,677
one remember?                   
We need delegation. Yes,        

1363
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:12,746
the scroll view needs to        
know which of its subviews      

1364
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,582
you want to have                
the transform change. And       

1365
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,118
it does that by asking you to   
delegate. So now we're gonna    

1366
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,788
get to see delegates            
in action right here.           

1367
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:25,526
So to make a delegate work,     
you need to set the delegates   

1368
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,795
to be yourself.                 
So I need to say,               

1369
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:32,966
scrollView.delegate = self.     
Now, this is not legal,         

1370
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:37,171
and this is going to generate   
an error. And hopefully you     

1371
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,807
can kinda see why, we'll look   
at the error, and it says,      

1372
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:43,110
you cannot assign the value     
of type ImageViewController,    

1373
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:47,614
which is what self is, to       
the type UIScrollViewDelegate   

1374
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:50,284
optional. So I told you that    
the ScrollViewDelegate is       

1375
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:53,454
an optional                     
UIScrollViewDelegate protocol,  

1376
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,155
and that's what it is.          
And of course,                  

1377
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,992
self isn't that even though it  
doesn't employ any methods and  

1378
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:00,060
that protocol has only          
optional methods.               

1379
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:03,130
Because it needs to go          
up here and say yes,            

1380
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:08,836
I'm a UIScrollViewDelegate.     
Okay, so this is this class,    

1381
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:12,406
UIViewController, saying I      
conform to this protocol, and   

1382
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:13,607
as soon as I do that,           

1383
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,544
the error goes away, and        
there's no errors. Even         

1384
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,146
though I didn't do anything,    
I didn't actually implement     

1385
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:21,682
the UIScrollView delegate       
protocol, that's because all    

1386
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,952
the methods in UIScrollView     
delegate are optional. So       

1387
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,987
I don't implement any,          
but they're all optional.       

1388
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:30,224
So I've conformed to            
the protocol. But of course,    

1389
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,992
that's not gonna help us with   
our zooming because we in       

1390
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:35,996
fact do need to implement       
a method. Now I'm gonna show    

1391
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:39,166
you a cool way to do this with  
extensions. I'm going to add    

1392
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,903
protocol conformance to my      
ImageViewController with        

1393
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:46,139
an extension. And               
I'm gonna do that like this.    

1394
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,209
So I'm gonna make it so that    
it does not conform, okay,      

1395
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,511
ImageViewController does        
not conform.                    

1396
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,883
But I'm gonna add an extension  
down here, at the bottom of my  

1397
01:15:55,951 --> 01:16:00,153
file, which is an extension     
to the ImageViewController,     

1398
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:04,858
which causes                    
ImageViewController to conform  

1399
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:09,096
to the UIScrollViewDelegate     
protocol. Okay, so by just      

1400
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:13,434
putting this here, this error   
down here is gonna go away.     

1401
01:16:13,503 --> 01:16:16,404
Because I've added an           
extension, which causes this,   

1402
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:19,172
this class right here to        
conform to this protocol.       

1403
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,974
Again, all the methods          
are optional so                 

1404
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,577
normally we would have to put   
a bunch of methods in here.     

1405
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:26,346
But I am gonna put the one      
method we do want down here,    

1406
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:31,518
which is viewForZooming         
in scrollView.                  

1407
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,988
Now what's interesting, notice  
as I start to type this,        

1408
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,359
it actually knows that I'm      
a UIScrollViewDelegate, so      

1409
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:40,694
it offers me that               
method as a choice, so          

1410
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,797
I'll double click on it.        
Here's my viewForZooming in     

1411
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:47,100
scrollView. I just need to      
return which view I wanna       

1412
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,269
zoom in for us. Of course,      
it's that image view.           

1413
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,572
So I wanna just say             
return imageView, but           

1414
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:58,511
that doesn't work. Why do       
you think that doesn't work?    

1415
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:04,751
This imageView is private.      

1416
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,323
Now, I could unmake             
it private, but                 

1417
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:12,326
now everyone can see            
that image view, and            

1418
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,729
that's a little too unprivate.  
So there's another kind of      

1419
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:20,968
private called fileprivate,     
and what fileprivate means is,  

1420
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:25,205
it's private to everyone        
in this file. So                

1421
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:29,276
that allows this extension      
to see this image view. And     

1422
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,577
it's still private              
to everyone else.               

1423
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,180
So everyone using my MVC        
who sees this, other files,     

1424
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:36,750
it's still private, they don't  
see it. But this guy can use    

1425
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,885
it, okay? So that's             
a different kind of private,    

1426
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:42,756
fileprivate. All right, so      
we got the view for zooming.    

1427
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,959
This is, in fact,               
the view we wanna zoom.         

1428
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:46,360
So let's go ahead and           
take a look here.               

1429
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:56,569
All right, here it is. We       
can still scroll around, and    

1430
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,506
if we hold down the option key  
and get our two fingers here,   

1431
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:03,477
we can also zoom. Okay, and     

1432
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:06,379
we can zoom in really small,    
and we can zoom out.            

1433
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,616
But notice, it won't let        
me zoom any larger than         

1434
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:13,154
1.0 because I set that as       
my maximum zoom scale.          

1435
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:18,625
All right, so, the last thing   
I'm gonna do, well, I'll leave  

1436
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,661
this as is cuz I'm gonna post   
this code like this, and        

1437
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:25,332
you can play around with it.    
Next time, what I'm gonna       

1438
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,835
do is add another MVC that      
lets us pick some NASA images,  

1439
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,273
you can see any NASA images.    
And one thing we're gonna find  

1440
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,442
about this images, they're      
huge, and even on our Stanford  

1441
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:38,745
network, they take a long time  
to download. And that's gonna   

1442
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,614
be annoying, and so we are      
going to use multithreading     

1443
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,083
to keep our UI responsive,      

1444
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:45,819
even though it's doing          
this very expensive thing,      

1445
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,256
which is downloading this       
huge file, all right? So,       

1446
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,591
I'll see you then.
